A 28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco shopping mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother did not think anyone could want to hurt him, saying: "Eventually things were going well for him".
The San Francisco Department of Forensic Medicine said Wednesday morning that the body found at Westfield Mall was identified as that of Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Department of Homeland Security has determined the cause of death was murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a kitchenette chef in Boston, had started working as a kitchenette chef at San Francisco Sons & Daughters six months earlier, when he got his dream job.
Sons & Daughters said the death "has left them in shock and deeply saddened".
"It's a small team working like a tight family here and he'll be greatly missed", the spokesman explained.
We want to tell Frank's family that they are not alone in this difficult time and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia noted that Frank initially stayed in hostels, saying, "Eventually things were going well for him".
Louis Galicia told KGO, "He was in an apartment and he was dating a girl".
Louis Galicia said he didn't think he could be someone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
He was a gentle man with a big heart.
The way to connect with the family was always to make us a plate, to cook us", said Louis Galicia.
He didn't like to argue.
My brother was a man of all skill.
He said, "While everything else in the world is going wrong, it was this unworked diamond that shines brightly every day".
Those with information were asked to call the SFPD Liaison at 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors on strike: calls for a new slowdown
Representatives of the physicians assistants have asked their unions to allow them to slow down the work due to a dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Committee of Assistant Doctors (JDC) called on the general council to support further work slowdown action from early September.
The JDC said the ministers were unable to address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students used the refusal in their contract with the BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voting members.
In a tweet on Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt said the government remained "extremely silent" about the issues that led to the contract's rejection.
He said: "In light of this, the JDC Governing Council voted to reject the proposed new contract altogether and called for a resumption of formal negotiations on the concerns".
In response to the government's silence, the JDC administration has formally requested that the BMA Board allow a program to increase the slowdown from early September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by assistant doctors this year, including the first one-off in NHS history.
Dr. Johann Malawana, assistant medical director at BMA, resigned after the BMA refused to accept the terms of the contract.
During the meetings before the 54,000 physicians and medical students voted, he told the BMA members that this was a good deal that should be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would be implemented in a way that would apply to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: A 'coalition of the sleepless'?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey gathered on Tuesday to shout hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war, which has been waged with words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the lavish hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I got the obvious impression that Ankara was the party most looking for this compromise.
Hands are stuck, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile was rather weak and could not be said to have spread any warmth against his own limited standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly mentioned Mr. Putin as his "good friend", five times according to one report.
I'm surprised at the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to pre-crisis levels, but reach much higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper here reported that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement was the opposite.
But Mr. Putin's cold demeanor showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Russia's reaction was furious.
Mr. Putin has made a tough exit accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The anger was much greater, the other side was thought to be a friend.
It will be difficult, if not impossible, to rebuild trust in the real world.
Since November, the Russian people's opinion has changed.
The state-controlled media has been targeting Ankara in a vicious and aggressive manner for months.
Suddenly, the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious of these were allegations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's family profited from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He refused it.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
In the end, the reason for this meeting was that Mr. Putin had apologized to President Erdogan.
Russia might see this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire call for Ankara are clear.
First, he needs friends after the failed coup that took place last month and nearly toppled Erdogan.
He was also deeply affected by the repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
And economic reasons are also effective.
Russia's sanctions have been harsh, especially the ban on private flights carrying several million Russian tourists to Turkey's coastal areas each year.
That's down almost 90 percent.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies were also relieved that flights would continue.
They're relying on the end-of-season intensity in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted that Turkish agricultural imports would be allowed back and that prices of fruits and vegetables would fall.
If we quote a story in Vedemosti, "Tourists there, tomatoes here".
But the visit had a special political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it does not find the response to the coup attempt sufficient.
With the long-standing anger over the swift progress of talks on joining the United States, Mr. Putin is taking the lead in seeking to take advantage of Turkey's disconnect from the West and the coldness between them.
The Russian leader seems to have certainly gathered sympathy from Ankara for the call for support from elected officials following the coup attempt.
It must be remembered that this was an inevitable attitude for Moscow, which itself had a deep-seated fear of regime change.
This summit, held in this lavish palace by the sea, represents a "coalition of the sleepless", as one analyst of Russia and Turkey described to me: a union of the powers of two countries that the West has rejected and misbehaved.
Yet despite this appearance of compromise, they are quite different.
One of the most important of these is about Syria: Russia and Turkey support different sides, even though Moscow presents itself as a mediator.
After almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said that the issue was not discussed at the press conference.
While the President of Turkey has explicitly refrained from answering a question about these differences, Mr Putin has chosen to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to define common ground in Syria.
But after months of openly held hostility - and given the absolute disastrous potential of NATO member Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter jet - it's definitely a good development for the two leaders to at least start talking.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland.
According to the bank's chief executive, the RBS brand will move into the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be defunct for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is linked to the bank's global goals.
Eight years ago, he was almost drowned, and he had to back off and give up.
During this time, brand strategists used the 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Wimbledon Andy Murray Championship.
But now it's decided that it's true that more national brands will come out.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but no new start-ups will be made.
All references to RBS except for central and exchange quotations in England and Wales will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will take on a much more dominant role for private banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed for a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "We will be a more branded bank from now on, so the RBS brand will no longer be our investment brand and the brand where our staff is employed".
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we have local targets, not global ones anymore.
Each of these brands will stand out in a slightly different way in the community, and our staff will work with customers under the brand name.
RBS had announced that it would not continue sponsoring the Six Nations Championship and was raising the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
The CEO said, "Now it's time to get into the concept of brand banking because (we were wondering) how can we make it a better bank for customers?"
Three years ago, if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and offer these brands, I would have found it ridiculous.
But I think you'll see a lot of change with the work we do and focusing on the needs of our customers, not ourselves.
We can get these brands back on track, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori won 3000 times with his Predilection victory at Newmarket.
Dettori has doubled his victory at Newmarket to 3,000 points and has blasted champagne.
Frankie Dettori, the jockey, won his 3,000th victory in England at Newmarket on Friday.
On the local track, he reached this milestone with his second victory of the night, the Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach that milestone in the handicap race.
He's following in the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"This is a special situation", said the jockey, who has won three championships in Ghayyar before.
I was so moved to have my family here.
I'm really happy that this is at Newmarket, where I started 30 years ago.
This is not a big meeting, not a Royal Ascot -- just a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel so relaxed and relieved.
Dettori accepted the manifestations by bringing Predilection after the victory.
Two jokers have reached this milestone in the handicap race: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired jockey Sir Anthony McCoy, a 20-time champion with a career record of over 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggott, a nine-time Derby winner, has 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the best jokers of our time, and it's no wonder he's reached a mile that only a few people have ever reached before him.
A man of style and strength, but a tactical mindset that makes him outweigh others in his weight.
He represents horse racing in an extraordinary way, and with his passion and charisma, he has attracted people to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that he could have won 6,000 if it wasn't for a jockey who races only on weekends and in major competitions.
Seriously, Frankie has spent most of his 30 years racing in the UK with victories, which is great to see.
He's got a pretty exciting character, and that's a very good feature for British racing, but beyond that, he's an extraordinary jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone with a landing motion that became iconic.
With his many moves, from his jump races to his horse jumps to his landings, Frankie Dettori has become a symbol of British unobstructed running for twenty years.
It was a paved road with a steep exit.
In 1996, he survived a plane crash and was banned for failing to comply with a drug ban, winning many major races including the famous 'Great Seven' victory in Ascot.
Three years ago, he had a hard time returning from this six-month period of isolation, but he showed a strong character to get rid of his suspects and return to his best form.
And it could go on for a while longer, as Dettori had previously expressed his desire to continue competing until at least age 50.
Russian President Putin has removed his special pen Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly removed his special envoy Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of Mr. Putin's close circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as special representative for environmental and transportation issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin "decided that Ivanov would terminate his position as head of the Russian administration", but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been representing Mr Ivanov since 2012, has been appointed to this position.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the Department of International Relations (MGIMO) of the renowned Moscow State Institute and served in the Embassy of Tokyo.
He later took over the presidential protocol and administration of government personnel , as expressed on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
After his assignment, he told Mr. Putin, "Thank you for trusting me".
I think the most important function of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of making laws and overseeing the implementation of instructions.
Mr. Putin announced on Friday to Russian television that he wanted Mr. Ivanov to step down and suggested Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Is that a good smile?
This is a move that will surprise Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was a longtime close ally of Vladimir Putin and served the KGB in the Soviet security forces like himself.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country, especially the pencil.
In a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on state television, both said the special pen was removed from office at their own will.
But despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, few people here are convinced of this, especially at this time when parliamentary elections are coming up.
Is this a conflict of some kind?
No one knows that yet.
But the official announcement that a potential president suddenly wants to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with great suspicion.
According to a quotation on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said to Mr Putin: "In a conversation we had earlier in 2012, it is true that I would like you to trust me for four years for this difficult - even problematic - task.
Well, apparently, I served as the president's private pen for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took up this position in December 2011.
He previously served as deputy prime minister and minister of defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, while Mr. Putin was the head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr. Ivanov delegated him.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he was showing Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Since it was unconstitutional for Mr. Putin to run for president in the third term, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov could become president after Mr. Putin's second term.
But this task was transferred to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin was prime minister before he returned to the presidency three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired after shooting the producer
Gibson got into a physical fight on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, announced in a joint statement that she had been fired.
Gibson, who portrayed Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Tuesday before his termination was announced.
There were differences and a disagreement about creative issues on the set.
In a statement, he said: "I am sorry that such an incident happened".
In a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the show following a group of FBI agents are being released at a later date.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously appeared in the situation comedy Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.
Gibson said in a statement released Friday, "I love Criminal Minds and I have worked with it for the past 12 years with my heart and soul".
I'd like to stay until the end, but that's no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team and most importantly, the best supporters a program can have.
The show is expected to return to the screen for its 12th season on September 28.
The mystery of the fish in Banff's garden
A resident of the Banff area has requested assistance in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks these 75 fish could be sandfish that were transported by sea hose.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted the images on Periscope in the hope that someone would shed light on the emergence of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Bridge: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensferry Pass and the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "table fans" that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge from Fife is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete with 46 support cables.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown is one of the first people to walk across the bridge from land today visiting the facilities.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge.
We are all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale with this project that uses over 30,000 tons of concrete to build just this section of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge, which closed the gap between the viaduct and the bridge board, this is a delicate work requiring extremely delicate tolerances for this fit.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge panel is installed, so the concrete pouring of the first section of the panel will take place today in Rosyth, which means the entire panel will be ready to be lifted over the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Gate and Bridge Contractors project, said: "In all bridge projects, the first closure is always a milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents a pioneering work in civil engineering.
After the last road sign was installed and connected to the expanding North Tower level, we had to close the gap on the north or the south side.
This was accomplished by pulling the northern ridge up to 700 millimeters south.
It was a very big, but also very delicate process.
The reason it was so large was because the pier was 222 meters long, weighed almost 6,000 tons, and had to be retracted at about 3% slope.
The reason it was sensitive was that the tolerance values the team had to adhere to were very low, only a few millimeters on either side.
Thankfully, everything went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Three men 'lucky they're alive'
Three men are "lucky to have survived" after falling off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI rescue booth station alerted at 13:20 on Friday, British summer time, after the order saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men were swimming to safety as the boats continued their course.
"We saw the boat drawing circles towards them and we became concerned", said the control officer of the Moelfre rescue booth.
He said: "But we were driven away by a strong wind until we went forth on a straight path".
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, a 60-year-old man, was found clinging to a lantern with no life jacket, exhausted.
They were all taken to the lifeguard 's cabin , which led to the shore , and brought to the lifeguard 's station .
Mr Jones said, "Three men who fell into the water were lucky to be alive and not injured.
The boat's engine had an emergency stop cable, but when the boat was under attack, it must have somehow disconnected from the person who was driving the boat.
Someone was watching these three guys today.
A precious game for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's really amazing to see how the world has changed.
The fact that young people and children no longer go out to play and prefer to spend their free time looking at screens has been a major concern for many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to get off the couch and move.
Time spent looking at screens, initially limited to television, has spread over time to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it's really great to see that technology and outdoor movement are not mutually exclusive.
And of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, a character-based app that was originally created for video games in the '90s (later turned into comics, playing cards, and other side products).
Like many popular culture phenomena, this new game was a hit when it was introduced in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, the show was postponed in other countries due to intense interest in overloading the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had reached more users than Tinder and almost the same number as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, players can take their smartphones, search for Pokémon in a GPS-tracked manner, and 'take a photo' of what they find (by taking screenshots on the phone) or 'catch them'.
A generation of younger players jumped off the couch to join the craze.
In the United States, gambling has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken daily by an "average" person.
Cardiogram, an app developed for the Apple Watch that has 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that the percentage of people who exercise 30 days a day has risen from 45 percent to 53 percent among those who follow it within two days of the game's introduction.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, only that it can see raw data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns that encourage people to "take 30 minutes off", "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have been ignored because most public health messages are boring and conveyed by seemingly discouraged people.
But the importance of exercise is not emphasized.
People who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with issues like weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and it has a long list of benefits that can't be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
This enables the three basic elements of health to be met: movement, fresh air, and sunlight.
Some people can even make new friends during the hunt.
As always, there are some unrefined gamers looking for something to complain about.
And of course, someone might knock on the door while walking.
What difference does it make?
A great innovation has been introduced.
Smartphone apps like Fitbit monitor our movement, but they don't give us a reason to exercise like this game.
The effect of innovation will pass and the use will decrease over time.
But due to Pokémon's success, many games will be released that help hunting people become more active, fit and healthy by combining applications and virtual reality with real-world activities.

Simone Biles won the gold medal in the women's gymnastics general relay.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic about jumping.
It's comfortable on the balance device.
It's amazing on the ground.
Perfection is down at first.
And he's an Olympic champion now.
The 19-year-old American gymnast also finished first in the overall rankings on Thursday, clearly showing the difference between himself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
In total, he scored 62,198 points, far above silver medalist and team-mate Aly Raisman of the "Last Five" and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles from the United States performed on the balance beam at the women's artistic gymnastics general relay final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row to receive the overall assessment award and the fifth overall, and made a name for herself as the best of her generation and perhaps of all time.
When the last volume was published, she was in tears and her long journey to reach this point was over.
This achievement has brought the sport to the same level as athletes like Michael Phelps, who can be seen once in every generation, taking the sport to new levels:
Biles spent the last three years as one of the sport's most successful with a mixture of ambition and sensitivity that led to 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton calling herself "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
A final test awaited him in Brazil, a contest between him and the burden of high expectations, rather than between him and others in the field.
It would have been a disappointment to return to her family home in Spring, Texas with less than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman from the United States won gold and silver medals respectively in the women's artistic gymnastics general event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Bills won his first on Tuesday, when he served as a celebrity sign at the farewell party of retired national team coordinator Martha Carolyi.
Although Biles is persistent in his long run to the top, he never looks forward.
The piece, which includes a simulated passage that has become a symbol of the ground exercise routine, is made with Latin music that will fit perfectly into the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted as a young child by her grandmother and grandfather and discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gymnasium coached by Aimee Boorman, became a force.
He hasn't lost a single general rating since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that Biles should continue as long as he wants.
Mustafina took the lead on two rounds, but it was temporary.
The balance gear and ground exercises that Biles took over the world championship were not yet done.
He led the way with 15,433 points on his balance sheet, which he crowned with 15,933 points on his ground exercise.
Raisman graciously embraced him while waiting for the final score, and as Biles' vision once came true in a black book, tears erupted around the glowing red, white, and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was similar to the predecessor of his performance four years earlier, when he shared fourth but then lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call "nine", took the lead.
He sometimes overcame a seemingly suspicious comeback, sending a kiss to the crowd after the exercise.
For 19-year-old Biles, the tweet he posted earlier this week has now taken on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims shot while listening to music in the car
In Phoenix's first serial killer in a decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while talking in the car and listening to music, according to police reports released Thursday.
Authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a garage road on June 12.
The report said the gunman fired eight handguns while standing on the passenger side of the car and drove away by another vehicle.
Police say the three murders do not appear to have been robbery-related because the attacker did not take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900 in cash.
Phoenix Police spokesman Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard said the gunman's attack has directed investigators to investigate whether it is connected to the previous four attacks.
In a four-month period, nine attacks in predominantly Spanish-speaking neighborhoods killed a total of seven people and wounded two.
Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month, "This happened in a residential area in front of a house".
The suspect is believed to have driven several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in a late 1990s model, a black BMW in a late 1990s model, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to provide evidence that the attacks were related to the same killer and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
One witness told police that it was not unusual for these people to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an empty truck half an hour before the three murders.
The researchers found the bullet casings, pulled a bullet from a chair, and detected bullet particles in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old microcephaly patient: "He's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, his toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, Edmund has a microcephaly disorder, a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When I first got home, my first thought was I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't mean to.
Of course, that's not true, and of course you want it".
He and his wife, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them, and might not even survive.
Some doctors went so far as to offer her a nursing home.
"My first reaction was to say that I don't think people are doing this anymore", Picccio explained.
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund couldn't sit upright or retire until he was three, and he still can't talk.
But he's slowly reaching some tipping points.
He can walk and ride a bike with help.
Besides, she likes to play games and sing with her two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented to say, "please sing to me".
Picciuto told CBS News, "We're teaching him sign language".
But this is not sign language, as we know, but Edmund's invention of his own sign.
Microsephalia can occur due to a number of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may exist and may be caused by infections caused by viruses such as measles and Zika during pregnancy.
The symptoms and course of the disease can be very different.
It's too early to tell how the lives of those infected with Zika will be affected by this.
Piccito remembers the emotional burden of the uncertainty of his future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know it.
In fact, I haven't asked a question about the course of the disease in a long time since I really expected anyone to tell me.
But Picciuto is able to offer hopeful advice to mothers of babies who are stillborn with Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it's better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and flooding in Louisiana, Mississippi, prompted rescue teams
Heavy rainfall and widespread flooding in Louisiana led to the governor declaring a state of emergency on Friday with more rain expected by Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that there has been a flooding of numerous rivers in northeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, posing a widespread risk of flooding following heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and support was on the way to affected neighborhoods.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for high-water vehicles, boats and trenches were made.
Steele said tons of bricks were being demanded for Tangipahoa neighborhood alone.
A water blockade will be in place for most of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
The Weather Service said in a report that it could rain up to 3 to 5 inches in addition to the area.
In South Alabama, there was a flood watch on Saturday as the rain continued in Mobile.
Both are expected to reach record levels over the course of the week at Comite River near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Amite River near Denham Springs.
Predictor Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said the flooding in Ascension neighborhood posed a threat as the floodwaters would flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at its highest level measured at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams are continuing to rescue people from the flooding in the Amite and Wilkinson crashes in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said that the water from the Beaver River, which is normally 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
Another stepson who lived nearby said he was warned.
Hansford said, "We woke up and the water kept coming".
He was coming to my attention.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he'd seen in the river in 48 years he'd lived here.
Hansford stated that he and his family members were disabled and that he was the only person who could swim.
Hansford said that three emergency crews were rescued by a large, military-style truck and taken to the fire station in Gloster, where they took shelter on Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding "has spread rapidly" as heavy rains continue and authorities are considering issuing an evacuation order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported a rainfall of 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been in a high saturation state since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and flooding caused the streets to need to rescue residents of Tangipahoa neighborhood and to call for school holidays in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a female city councillor in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were under flooding.
Residents were evacuated and taken to two churches, but they are also now under flood.
Robby Miller, the district manager, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by rising waters.
Shelters have been opened for evacuees in Amite and Hammond.
He said, "When they start to retreat, they'll be allowed to go home".
In Hammond, Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to rising water and cypresses were offered for residents trying to keep water away from their homes and businesses.
City manager Lacy Landrum said, "The last major flood we've seen was in March".
It looks like this is going to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the rain continued steadily along the Gulf Coast.
He said that several houses were reported flooded on Tuesday, but there was no notification so far for Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water where I've never seen water before", and added, "and it's still raining".
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, "with his body pierced with bullets", survived the Philadelphia attack
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old this week in the city.
For CBS Philadelphia, Mahaj Brown was diagnosed by his grandparents.
His grandparents said Brown's body had multiple gunshot wounds, including the pelvic area, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station that "she suffered a lot, her tiny body was punctured with bullets".
I can't believe this.
The boy was listed as a critical condition patient in the hospital and underwent some surgeries.
The family told the station that she was expected to recover.
He was going to start freshman year at the local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two men, 29, one 32, were shot.
CBS Philadelphia said one of the 29-year-old men was critically ill, and the other two victims were stable.
The station said the boy was found shot in the front seat of a car with one of the 29-year-old men in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the wounded was an assailant.
Detectives have told CBS Philadelphia that multiple gunmen may have shot each other.
The scene was filled with different types of assault weapons.
It seems there's definitely been a long-running conflict.
There were covers on both sides of the street and the sidewalk.
"This indicates that there are multiple gunmen and both are active", Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly inspecting security cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was shot in the arm with an accidental bullet while playing outside her home in the West Oak neighborhood on Tuesday.
He's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
I named this year's Olympic women's gymnastics team, and there are multiple reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant before.
And second, this team has three gymnasts who have inspired many girls of different ethnic backgrounds: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team, put together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally showing an American-like look.
It also reinforces the presence of black and Latino women at the highest levels of the sport.
In the last four years, the first female gymnast ever became an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
It's a powerful thing.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America supported her.
Now the whole world will be able to witness the extraordinary performances of three world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed their unexpected but skillful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the women's overall.
And team-mate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
We're introducing the best of the sport, but it doesn't seem like it's happening at gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
The reason they're the "Last Five" is because there's only four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi will coach.
But in reality, gymnastics is a very expensive sport, and gymnasts work primarily in private gymnastics clubs supported by parental-paid education, travel, fitness, competition, hotel fees (for trainers, gymnasts and families), and many more.
Most of these gyms are located in affluent suburbs that can disrupt these businesses.
These clubs are the only place gymnasts can get training and require a costly and long-term commitment for gymnasts' families.
Simone Biles' coach, Aimee Boorman, and Laurie Hernandez's coach, Maggie Haney, have been training these athletes since they started gymnastics.
We're not offering more affordable and accessible gymnastics education to communities for the countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organization, we have provided free, low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 young people (mainly black and Hispanic) in the city, both nationally and internationally, with our Harlem-based headquarters.
In September, we'll expand to Detroit, where I grew up, to provide quality gymnastics education to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics enhances the strength, flexibility, and coordination of the body and provides mental rigidity, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers long-term benefits in terms of health, school and work success.
The inspiration for this team that will guide thousands of young girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sports is very important, especially for girls.
We're having a really exciting time.
Thank you for bringing the Olympic gold medal to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison as an Olympic team to showcase the power of girls and motivate many young girls from different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the doctors' assistants decided to continue the strike.
The ministers hoped the dispute would end after negotiations on a contract were reached with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who took part in the vote refused.
In July, Mr Hunt announced plans to implement sanctions on the contract, stating that the NHS is "no one's property" and that further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first group of physicians were transferred to a new contract, which included changes to working practices at night and on weekends to improve care outside normal hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's assistant physicians committee, said in a statement last night: "The assistant physicians are still seriously concerned about the proposed contract, especially considering that it will trigger the current labor crisis and not adopt an equal approach to all doctors".
We're only eight weeks away from the first group of doctors getting a new contract, and the time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute through speaking were met with reluctance by the government to interact and, in some cases, deafening silence.
This is a development despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that the door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act immediately, lift sanctions and listen to the physician assistant's concerns".
The physician assistants make it clear that they are prepared to increase their work-slowing actions if they fail to do so.
In the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, and nurses and counselors were forced to take the place of doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped the dispute would be resolved after negotiations on a contract were reached with the British Medical Association officials.
BMA wants a weekend pay raise for the 54,000 physician assistants covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the executive director of the NHS employers, called on the doctors' assistants to not strike.
"The strike does not solve anything", said Mr Mortimer, "but it creates anxiety, discomfort and distress for patients, caregivers and their families by putting pressure on the teams and services that are already busy".
Over the past two months, we have continued to hold discussions with the Assistant Doctors Committee and have approached the Ministry of Health and other officials in a positive manner with their concerns about the Supervisory Mission and Reporting.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive communication on key issues - distribution, education flexibility, additional education for those who are taking a break from their careers, training costs, mutual consensus on the curriculum, education-based leave and gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how seriously the employers, the UK Ministry of Medical Education and Health took action in line with agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A drug that could reduce the risk of heart attack at £2 a day.
After the authorities recommend longer doses to more people, thousands of heart attack patients could benefit from £2 a day of medication.
Ticagrelor, which prevents constipation, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures for people with heart disease.
The drug was administered for 12 months following a heart attack and reduced the risk of stroke or another attack.
NHS observer NICE recommended that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS observer NICE has recommended that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, about 140,000 people in the UK have a heart attack, and a quarter of them have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances that form plaques in the artery walls.
If the plaque is broken, it can cause a heart attack by blocking blood flow to the heart, causing blood to clot.
And if the clot is removed, it's going to be a stroke, which prevents blood flow to the brain, and it's going to be a stroke.
People who have had a previous crisis are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, created by the UK firm AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of a clot.
The NICE draft guidance published today recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for three years.
"Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatments", says Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, "about a quarter of those who have a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke, and the results are often devastating".
The fear of relapse can have a very negative effect on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that the use of ticagrelor with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and strokes in people who have previously had heart attacks.
With the temporary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have increased the treatment options available to thousands of people waiting to benefit from it.
Since more than three years of knowledge about the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor is limited - initially to the risk of bleeding - the draft guideline does not recommend treatment after this period.
PC culture has increased voter corruption in Muslim regions
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year following a government report on corruption
As the devastating government report presented today shows, a culture of political integrity has led to widespread voter corruption being ignored in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles has criticised police, election observers and the city hall for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse over "excessive sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former community secretary and current anti-corruption czar said that the religious disgrace of voters was so bad that police should be allowed to draw a ribbon outside polling stations to protect feared voters.
He suggested that voters keep their identities with them to prove their identity when they vote.
In the present case, it is sufficient to state the name and address of the selector.
The report even recommends that people be put permanent ink on their fingers during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said those on the report should be better protected.
He called for better access to the press on board documents and decisions of informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it", he said.
The report was prepared at the behest of Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that after repeated corruption and illegal practices, the mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office.
The court found that Rahman "abused the religious sentiments of the Muslim community unabashedly" and silenced those who criticized him with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman was said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is a religious duty for believing Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 games were suspected or the result of using a fake ID, voting as if it were someone else.
Sir Eric has stated that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He warned of the corruption in postal voting, in particular - where it was alleged that the elderly members of the Muslim community were pressured to vote on the island of their choice.
Sir Eric made some suggestions for a voting system that would include having people carry their identity to prove who they are
The report included the following statements: "Evidence was obtained that some ethnic minority communities were primarily pressuring their valued individuals, including women and youth, to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.
"There were concerns that government agencies were ignoring such behavior because of 'political integrity' based on over-sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric has proposed 50 proposals to regulate the system, including preventing political activists from processing their mail and ballot papers for "crowding".
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tightening registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and welfare fraud.
Consideration of the option of voters' identification before voting.
Permanent ink applied to the person's fingers after voting to prevent any person from voting twice.
The systematic checks on the person's motivation to determine eligibility to vote.
Application of three years' limitation on applications for automatic mail voting.
Prohibition of political campaigners and activists from processing completed postal ballots and postal envelopes.
Authorizing the police to strip around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the Public Prosecution Act 1983.
Making photographing in the polling booths illegal.
The requirement that only English is spoken in the polling booths (except the Galleries).
Strengthen the training of staff on the enforcement of the voter-only rule.
Sir Eric has been ruthlessly critical of the Police Service, saying it is "interesting" that no charges have been brought in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court has ruled that there is no room for accusations of repeated corruption and illegal activities for Lutfur Rahman and his representative", he said.
For a number of reasons, beyond reasonable doubt, he was convicted of the nature of the criminal evidence.
He also criticized the ineffective "box marking controls" in the municipal election registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "The Tower Hamlets court ruling last year was a warning sign.
While our nation is proud to be the mother of parliaments, the spread of these worrying and covert electoral corruptions and the rejection of some institutions can cause this good reputation to be damaged.
Mad about Kate's bike-like and other famous Rio Olympics-like
This week, the Rio 2016 Olympic passion has gone crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete isn't the only athlete to have come to the limelight this summer for his similarity to celebrities in the gold medal fight; at least, social media thinks so.
So, in honor of all the celebrities we've seen on our screens and at the Rio Games, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who look more like Hollywood celebrities than just resembling them.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the U.S. Men 's Archery Team , compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's bicycle track counterpart, many people online have shown that an archer can look as twinned as Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, tweeted after photos showed him resembling the star of the movie Money Hunter.
And the archer, noticing this madness on social media, admitted that he was told he looked like Leo since he was a child.
Brady told the Huffington Post: "I don't think there's much similarity except for hair and beard".
'He's a handsome man himself, so I guess that's a compliment.'
There's another similarity, one of London's most popular comparisons of 2012, and one that will undoubtedly be more noticeable this year: the incredible similarity of British long jumper Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina was described as a one-of-a-kind image of the Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan with her large, meaningful eyes.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user indicates that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Star Trek star
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared to each other because of their thick eyebrows and similar lips.
The Russian team's silver medal swimmer, Annalynne McCord, said her fans said that while she had the same bronze skin and yellow hair as the actress, U.S. team's Nathan Adrian "looked like an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Hard women: Soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial shapes and eyes
Not alone: One Twitter user was delighted that others noticed the similarity.
A theory that's in the air: This user thinks there might be a reason why this couple looks similar.
One Twitter user shared his happiness that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are like twins".
The American football star and the actress in Dexter actually has similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include the almost identical smile of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and the similar big smiles of Gabby Douglas, another gold medal gymnast, and Gabrielle Union, star of the film Youth Fever.
CBC Olympic spokesman apologized for comment by Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the 4x200m freestyle relay angered those watching CBC's live Olympic broadcast Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize for one of its speakers' comments that the 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer 'was wiped out like a bad smell' and 'died like a pig' in the race.
Speaker Byron MacDonald thought the microphone was off when the women started expressing their ideas in the 4x200m freestyle final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC's spokesman's team to add color, was reported to have said, "The little Chinese guy, 14, has been hit hard, baby".
He was so excited, he went off like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14), finished second in the flag race with a time of 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds behind Canadian Taylor Rack, allowing Canadians to close the gap between China and Canada.
Canadian viewers reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language used
Emmett Macfarlane "The CBC spokesman just tweeted that the 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'????
The idiot didn't know it was still on the air.'
Chinese Ai Yanhan, at the 4 x 200m Free Flag Race, was described as saying, "14-year-old Chinese boy has been heavy-handed, baby".
There was a lot of criticism on Twitter about Byron MacDonald, and it was pretty hard and fast, and many people were trying to tell him.
Twitter users couldn't help but wonder how insensitive Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Way #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all look racist. #midebulant.
Shortly afterward, CBC broadcaster Scott Russell apologized for MacDonald's comment: "We apologize for the comment made on the race".
Those were truly unfortunate words, and I'm sorry that such an incident happened.'
CBC has had to apologize to those who tweeted in response to the comment at least 90 more times.
Another speaker, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC later copied and pasted this apology to over 90 Twitter users who shared complaints about MacDonald's comments.
The network quickly issued an apology statement.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and published.
Last night, we apologized to our broadcasters, our viewers, our followers on social media.
We'd like to clarify that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but his performance.
However, these were very inappropriately and unfortunately chosen words, and Byron is extremely sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast, saying he did not want to commit personal assault.
She said on CBC's Olympic broadcast: "I want to apologize for a comment I made after the women's flag race last night".
'I was not referring to the character of the character, but to his performance.'
'No need to say, I didn't mean to disrespect you and I'm so sorry.'
Primark customer, in the middle of the store, pissed at the woman who was trying on her underwear
Customers didn't know what to do when a woman pulled her clothes off to try on her underwear in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she looked at what it looked like on her, took it out, and put it back on the shelf.
He continued to look, and then tried four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The place where she tried her panties before she put them back on the shelf was the Primark store at Bouverie Place in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on the mysterious woman's underwear, she "went back and left without buying anything".
He himself said: "They could not believe their eyes".
He stood in the middle of the store and took a pantie out of the window, took off his panties and put on his pants.
'He didn't try to find a special place to do it, he stood out in all disrespect.'
'As he removed the pants, everyone was looking at him and it was obvious that he didn't like the pants because he put them back on the shelf.'
He tried three more laundries until he decided he didn't like anything, and then he went out of the store, dressed again.
"He didn't seem to care about the people who were watching him, and he didn't think about who would buy the pants he was wearing".
"How disgusting it is to think that someone else will take home an uncleaned underwear that someone else is wearing", said Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in the city.
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: 'I think the staff found clothes after she left and put them out of business, which is a good thing.'
'When I went home with a new pair of panties, it would be really bad to think that someone else would take them off and come to me without washing them.'"
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9".
The product concerned has been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself against Krav Maga and armed attacks
The outside world is quite dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can help you be safer.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, the headmaster of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to learn how to deal with nearby armed robbers.
Whether you're approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says that when he comes to you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around and see the attacker and "empty the fire line".
Then you'll hold the gun between your forearm and shoulder and shoot him in the face with your empty elbow.
Then when you kneel down on your hammers, the pain of the attacker will double, and at this point, he will turn the gun and take it from his hand, and you will shoot him in the face with the gun's head pointing upwards, with the back of the gun pointing upwards.
A similar technique is used when the gunman approaches from the front, pulling your body from the line of fire and grabbing the gun and turning it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, you're putting your weight on the weapon, punching the attacker from the chest area, turning the weapon from him, and then you're turning the weapon at him.
Does that sound obnoxious?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid any robbery is to give your money to a robber.
Traveler Ian Wright has his tongue stuck in the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide.
The British traveler has undergone a serious test of his immune system and his grinding reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The speaker and travel writer, Suffolk's Ian Wright (51), used his tongue to prove the power of the immune system by a euro banknote, a Piccadily Circus stall, a train toilet's syphon button, and an anchored phone in Russia.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what kind of work he was doing.
However, the experiment, which was to be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, yielded some surprising results.
While the idea of licking a trendy siphon button used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, there are actually far more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Mr. Wright has consulted with doctors and medical professionals about the growth and health of stomach bacteria during his trip to Europe.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused any effect except the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for traveling the world and testing his stomach's stamina by eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, ranging from general lockers at train stations to toilet seat belts, definitely tested the immune system.
In the film about it, he said: "I have not been very health conscious since I was a child, and I have put a lot in my mouth, from soil to worms and muddy water".
And during the film, he has proven the cause of his fame.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The slide sample showed a luminometer count of over 4,000 units.
If you have to make a comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be below 60.
But when he was under 60 with his newly washed hands, the luminometer count went above 4,000 units, and he refused to lick a Russian public toilet.
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have taken over the production of a travel film, The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, showing the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
He said in the movie, 'This is probably one of the worst things I've ever smelled in a bathroom.'
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was developed in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contained lactic acid bacteria as well as stomach bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helped strengthen the immune system.
Senior Vice President of Valio's Snacks, Fruit Waters and New Categories department Niko Vuorenmaa said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that's impressive to watch, but also explains the benefits of probiotics.
We've had a lot of crazy brainstorming where the whole "let's call Ian" idea finally pops up.
They claim that interest in gut health has become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put a much larger link between the products -- the good and bad bacteria that surround us on a daily basis, the importance of stomach health and how it relates to the immune system.
Interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we could provide consumers with interesting information about this condition.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me tell you, I would lose respect for Ian if he licked some of the things I want him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie".
Naturally, some things were easy for Ian to lick, but some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we're recording some of these dirty licking acts.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria to stomach health, and 58 percent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
The Maganda family destroyed the social housing in Saltash, Cornwall, before evacuation
A family of cooks have left £50,000 worth of damage to the social housing they evacuated for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their residence in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints about their rights.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the housing association was surprised to see that the property was unrepairable.
The walls had large holes, the floorboards were torn down, trash was scattered, and wall inscriptions were written on the walls.
The family is now removed from the home and is believed to be taking advantage of private accommodation options
Donna McEvoy, Housing Manager at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned the situation was irreversible.
He said: 'It's a real nightmare for the people here and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There's a lot to consider because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and their names have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who lived on the estate, and according to police, the family had engaged in many frightening behaviors, including fighting with baseball bats in the street, intimidating neighbors, using drugs, selling drugs and over-screaming, arguing and blasphemy.
In June, an antisocial conduct order was issued for Skeldon, 47, whose name was in the contract of employment.
Many rooms of the house that was supposed to be demolished were found with old garbage
The flooring of the drug-dealing property was removed
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and were frequently called by police.
Cornwall Housing granted him and his wife an 11-week extension to their voluntary move this week.
The evacuation was met with delight by the relieved neighbors who said their lives had turned into a nightmare.
One person said, 'No one cared.'
We've lived side by side with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You won't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because it was so quiet, we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, and now everything's gonna be great.
Cornwall Housing's neighborhood sanctions officer, Adam Fitzpatrick, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family had lived in this house for 20 years and the property was often called by the police.
Trash and old toys were thrown into the vegetated side of the social housing
He added: 'It is truly shameful that the tenant has not taken any responsibility for the eviction of himself and his family; the eviction has always been the last option Cornwall Housing has applied for.
This was a very difficult decision, since the behavior was so extreme and the actions were so frightening that the neighbors should not testify.
I appreciate the efforts of my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police Force and members of the community who have bravely come forward to inform us.
I hope this development will provide some relief to the neighbors and a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons living on the property at different times, but they were in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after evacuation
Housing workers will have to clean up the garbage heaps around their homes
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of marijuana, weights, personal effects and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs with intent to sell.
He claimed he would use the money to buy a tombstone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It turns out that after becoming homeless, Tanya and her husband are now living in a private residence in Plymouth.
Most of the rooms in the house had wall inscriptions.
Police said they will work to evacuate tenants who violate the rental rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police Force said the evacuation was also a warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
He said, "This is a message for those who think they can do what they want without being accused of it and that their actions will be in vain".
The Devon and Cornwall Police Force, which will continue to work with its partners to protect society, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behaviour.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military plane flew from below the beach
Sun-drenched tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced a shock to their lives
The Portuguese Air Force has flown the P-3C Orion from a very low altitude
The Air Force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when tourists start to panic as they pass the jet-filled beach from below.
In dramatic images, a military plane approaches the sun-drenched on the sands of Aveiro, northern Portugal, almost at the touch of a button.
The vacationers stood up, understandably worried about the noise of jet engines, before they could see what was coming towards them from the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who shared the video of the dramatic near-flight on social media, said: "It really went down twice and at some point it looked like it was about to hit".
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and I swear, I felt like the plane was going to fall on me".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane that came out of the darkness began to fly at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify the fishing boats on the shore and was in such a low-level position that it was the only way to control them.
He said the jet was flying below normal because of poor visibility due to the smoke from the fire, but the air force insisted that no one's safety was at risk.
This summer, power-to-extend fires have severely devastated certain parts of the Portuguese mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot must fly low due to conditions that make it difficult to see (intense fog and smoke caused by the fires withdrawal power)
The plane was in training flight and as part of the training , the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats .
London student who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadisa Sultan, one of three British female students who left London to join ISIS last year, was reportedly killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said his family had been informed of his death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on the Rakka area where the group was strong in the country.
The sultan was 17 years old and died while planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain, according to his family.
Akunjee "We hope this situation will highlight the real risk of going to war zones as a tombstone and will for others and discourage people from making this choice".
In February 2015, two female students from Sultana and east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The family of Sultana was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid has stated that he will not relinquish Garland as a Supreme Court nominee if Clinton is elected
In the Senate, Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he believed the Democrats would nominate Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if Hillary Clinton were elected president.
The Republicans in the Senate have been hampering Garland's approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced that the new president will choose a successor to former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a video address Thursday that he believed Clinton would choose Garland and that he "had reasons for that".
Later, a spokesman for Reid said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether or not he would nominate Garland, and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team did not want to "destroy the current situation" by making a new election.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans, who prevented Garland from running, were "supporters" and "defenders" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for duty.
Treats said he was in favor of a naked calendar, "as much for men as for women".
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by 1970s Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of celebrities and naked people, they're working to find the next generation of ball models for the 2017 NU Inspiration Fairies calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw said earlier this year that the magazine, which had a high nudity rate, was different from the old Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he believes that's the way the calendar works.
Shaw said in a press release on the calendar, "We need to get back to the classic, out-of-fashion nudity so that men and women can easily look at these images of the female body as inspiration".
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can post photos online or participate in open interviews in Los Angeles and New York.
The target of the vinyl: who are the actual buyers?
Middle-aged, lonely men love wine.
Before we go to the comment section to make some amazing insults under our umbrella, let us say that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the return of records, a hot topic, is not a result of the Y-Generation's pursuit of innovation created by a physical object, but of middle-aged nostalgia.
Most recent vinyl buyers are between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the lowest likely.
This is also not just the act of saving up for curious people; it's emotional; older vinyl buyers are often people who like to keep their feelings to themselves (56% and 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% and 66%).
So, are YouGov's findings true?
If this was a TV news blog, the camera would watch me walk down a crowded street in Soho in a modest gray suit, perform a lot of gestures before stopping, and then join hands and open up and say something authoritarian like, "Let's take a look".
Well, let's take a look.
While the center of Soho is slowly losing its charm and unusual atmosphere (buildings once occupied by independent vendors are now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases) there are still a few specialist record shops.
I would probably ask him to stand in the camera for the next part, and I would stand next to the different men in some of these stores and try to observe them to find out about their age and emotional state.
Stuart, 55, of Glasgow, whom I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, probably a woman in her 20s), spends an afternoon in London for a meeting and checks stores to fill up a few hours of his spare time.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I guess I am", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates above the picture (the picture he emailed me, I didn't follow him home) adorn the living room walls.
The reason he collects so many albums and singles is partly because of his disposable income, which allows him to buy records that he didn't have enough money for when he first came out and buy back what he sold when he was young and metal-free.
"Most of the things I got were late '60s and early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old, things that I was too young to get", he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be lonely, introverted people, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much alcohol.
That's my bad temper.
Sister Ray, who works for Wez, 25, thinks that many of the clients she encounters fit her YouGov profile.
But he also realized that there was a new wave of media over-promotion, and that those who heard the trend was coming back needed to buy back old records.
I've learned from interviews that you normally left people's collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who used to sell vinyl records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get them back".
This may explain the increase in the number of people of a certain age who revive vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional importance of the records?
It takes you a few seconds to realize that in a store like Phonica, record stores offer a comfortable community of people with similar personalities.
According to Wez, some older customers, especially contactless payment systems, were offended.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to take refuge in the stability of familiar vinyl covers that recall their depressed and calming youthful memories of the digital world.
"Sometimes it can be to fill a void or to see material objects as a kind of comfort", says Wes.
I'm a collector myself, so I think most people have it.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social workers", says a coworker who jumps from a pile of records.
A survey in April revealed that 50% of vinyl album buyers haven't listened to an album yet.
The survey also found that 41 percent of them had a pickup truck they never used and 7 percent bought vinyl without any records.
At this point in the story, I would probably be looking extremely anxious while studying a series of bossa nova compositions.
The "reward" aspect of this return was also noticed by Jonny, 42, who worked on Sounds of Universe.
"Recently someone came to me and said, 'I don't have any records, but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelf.'"
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely reflects the current situation.
More product, less music.
Some people say, "I don't play records".
These are not old people, these are young people, those in their late teens, those new to the subject.
Now, when I get to Fopp, which has almost a whole floor reserved for vinyl, I see the crowd is quite variable.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, young boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less cool than the above-mentioned stores (the last part of Wild Beast), and pop with sex content is spreading from the speakers to the soothing jazz, it's good to see the diversity among customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to solve the psychological trauma that's bothering them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been touring Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the discount plates.
Instead of spending money, he just went out to look in the windows.
He says he doesn't make much money, so he doesn't have the option of making a record collection.
It's very expensive.
It's easier to listen to music on a computer or something, but the beauty of vinyl... "
I don't know how to explain it, it's really nothing like it.
My last stop is a store that's said to inspire the next generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
While pretending to be looking at jeans, I watch a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter discuss buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records, not for an average collection, but a mix of modern and classic.
No one's looking, maybe it's just for decorative purposes, some of them too high to touch.
It's a completely "art vinyl".
But the curiosity about these things could mean that the industry will make more money and send fewer customers to the depths of Soho; there's not much to complain about.
It's not surprising that a demographic with more money and time than most would spend more on more luxurious items like vinyl.
But my findings suggest that YouGov's findings are true, at least in Soho record stores, which are overwhelming, and in reality, they don't take into account female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts in record stores or online forums.
These people probably work quite hard in schools or offices.
These guys certainly don't spend Thursday evenings in record shops on Berwick Street, studying records and avoiding the gaze of a 30-year-old fake TV host staring over the shoulders of middle-aged men who know nothing.
Greenland shark, the world's longest-lived vertebrate animal - video news
Scientists have revealed that the Greenland shark is the longest-lived of the vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who conducted studies on the sharks, said the record was held by a female, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old, five metres long.
French court rejected the proposal to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp
A court in France rejected the proposal of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of drug stores and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that the state should demolish a total of 72 fur-roof stores where people in the camp sold products ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, haircuts or tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
The governor of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they created a parallel economy without taxation and because they contained risks in terms of fire and hygiene.
Aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, and free food provided by government-sponsored organizations and other groups was not enough for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that rooftop shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille held that there was no legal basis for deporting people who operated 72 drug stores, but that the Calais Valley's concerns were "fully understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that shops, cafes and restaurants had a far greater role to play than simply feeding people living in "extremely dangerous conditions".
He said these areas provided convenient meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the most endangered places, the nonprofit Jungle Book Cafe for Children, offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and counseling on asylum for hundreds of underage refugees in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect this children's cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was stated that the closure would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the population of the Jungle camp had surpassed 9,000 (the highest number to date) after the number of arrivals increased during the summer.
After gold in Fiji's master class, Britain is satisfied with silver medal in the rugby sevens championship
Britain's impressive progress in the Rugby 7 Championship ended with a 43-7 defeat at the Rio Deodoro Stadium in the final against Fiji on Thursday.
Fiji took a mastery lesson in grasping, passing, sidewalking, support, running lines and muscle strength to win the first ever Olympic gold medal in any color.
After the defeat, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a not too bad consolation prize and can now be proud of their efforts in the opening tournament of the Olympic Games 7, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier in the day, he might have found them in the final after the South African team beat them 7-5 in the semi-final.
But still, a Fiji in this shape could beat a 15-man team.
It's not very believable, but perhaps Britain can find solace in the thought that at least one Briton will wear the gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
It's been a rather difficult journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens Championship.
This time, they lost only one.
Although this is a sadness, the progress made is truly astonishing.
Fiji got off to a fascinating start, with players crawling through the ball's British attempts.
It was like running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his crew, and the World Series champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisao moved from the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai came across another false number from the right wing.
The game was 12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented Leone Nakarawa from throwing a third like a mountain, but it only delayed Fiji's count.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Great Britain fell behind 17-0
With only a minute left in the first half, Nakarawa came from the start and scored another goal.
Vatemo Ravouvouvou then crossed the line for the score, passing through some difficult British interventions.
With that number, the score was 29-0 in the half.
When Fiji was a team set up to play in the 7th championship, it was as if Britain were just learning the basics of the business.
That's pretty much it.
Great Britain made major changes between rounds and closed the Fiji dam for four minutes, which was a good improvement over the first half until Joshua Tuisova came on stage with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton made a try for Great Britain and tried to make a 36-7 from the left corner, but the game was in the hands of the South Sea Islanders who sang, waved the flag and danced.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji's cheerful approach from start to finish.
Maa William also loved the final additions to the Fiji game that didn't need to be decorated at the last minute.
When the bell rang, the Fijians began to celebrate and Britain made its way to the dressing room, in a manner that was disgraced.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, while Britain faced South Africa in a tough semi-final match, with Britain leading by a single point.
Kyle Brown led the South African team in the first half, but Dan Norton led in the second half with his head-to-head moves.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was ranked in the top 15 in England, was able to secure a victory and a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their coaches' battle with cancer, have won the race.
There will be no more emotional gold medal at these games, and that is of great significance.
After 220 painful breaths from first to last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won gold at the Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
Although there were two people pulling the oars, there were three voices on the boat, and the voice of coach Robin Williams was echoed on the boat as they advanced to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal as the first women to reach that level in the women's doubles event in England this year.
Their rule was pretty clear, and this was the 39th race of an unprecedented unbeaten streak.
While we see two great athletes floating on the surface in the grace of the eagle, this image does not fully reflect the quality of victory.
Behind every shell gold medal is a squad of willing hands that make this difference, and no hand was as effective as their coaches who didn't know if they'd make it to the next level when they were diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, they touched and left.
I was diagnosed with a surgically treatable type of bladder cancer, and they did.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook on life a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to start treatment in early 2014, off-season, so it's not clear if that's the right statement in these cases, but it'll minimize distraction.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
That was an encouragement to me.
I was in the hospital, and they said I had to take a few steps, but I was walking six, nine, 15 meters in the yard.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bigger.
It was Williams after the victory, who had a tense morning, talking a little more than usual, to overcome his own worries.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery and had previously been to Afghanistan, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a little over the top, but it really means a lot".
It's a reminder of what this means to me and how hard Helen, me and Robin work.
I had a great three years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be here, so I want to say my deepest thanks to him for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better person or a better coach to work with.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The duo has a difficult rhythm that their rivals cannot reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark closed the gap, Stanning and Glover's strength was not yet exhausted.
We were so caught up in it.
Helen was like, 'Watch the process, watch the process.'
It's really important not to get caught.
We got off to a good start and we weren't trying to do anything amazing.
We didn't expect the fireworks to go off today, we just wanted to win the race by good rowing, and we did.
The two will take a year off before deciding what to do next.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, his own wedding, and that of TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now, he just wants to enjoy this moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have put a lot of pressure on me.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was very new and I was very stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better".

Bulgaria reveals inflation values for the first time in 8 months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria in June was at 1%.
This is the highest value seen in years (since June 2012), but the first value seen above zero since October after last year's positive 0.2%.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0 percent compared to June 2016, which means monthly inflation was at 1.0 percent.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (comparison of July 2016 to December 2015) was -0.2%, while the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, prices increased in the following consumer product groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), consumer goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in the clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, home equipment and routine care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, and prices remained the same in communication and education groups.
Snapchat's "Anime" effect has been criticized as an Asian cartoon
While Snapchat claims to be inspired by animation for this filter, some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Snapchat enables about 150 million users every day to play with their identities at an absurd level by changing reality.
You can transform yourself into a tradition, a dog, or a character that jumps from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The spark plugs are careless, trait-changing tools that create over 30 million self-attractions every day.
Wrong steps are quickly engraved in the public memory.
Snapchat's owners have faced accusations in the past that the app supports black classification or offers whitened skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So, because of the lens they presented this week, which made users with shy eyes, broken teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics criticized the company for its "Asian mask" caricaturing Asians.
And they wondered if these repeated conflicts pointed to a larger problem with the company's diversity.
News and outrage spread through The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday, and a day later Snapchat announced it had removed the feature.
The company said in a statement that the Mercek was not made to be cartoonised by Asians, but to honor the anime characters.
But for observers with experience of racism, this flashlight reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others generally rejected the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student who tweeted about the photos, said in an email that the subject matter was "painful and disturbing in the slightest terms".
"He added that it is difficult to argue when it comes to comparing the side effects of the filter with the bad Asian cartoon.
Which means the filter is not only an Asian mask, but also an Asian mask on a degrading level.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's outpaced the cultural trigger mechanisms.
American culture is seen to be in an endless conflict of diversity and inclusiveness in many areas, from institutional meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry.
And what Snapchat is talking about, it can be interpreted as a broad range of young people who are more racially diverse than their counterparts, who may also have a higher expectation of sensitivity.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lights creates a demeaning image for a user, "it's much harder to not notice these kinds of moves as they used to be".
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and called on everyone to do the same.
In an article for Medium and a telephone interview, he stated that he believed that conflicts over race reflected the lack of diversity in hiring practices on Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu ended her article with a tag: #SnapchatiSilin, criticizing the company's mostly white male leadership team.
"Either because there is insufficient diversity among the staff, or because they are working and working there and are of different races, they do not feel safe or comfortable enough to talk to themselves", said Ms. Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers share his views on the complaint, which Snapchat largely left unanswered.
The company does not share figures on diversity among its staff, emphasizing the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to share the racial origins of its staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently added a recruitment responsibility to increase its efforts to focus and integrate internally on populations that are not adequately represented.
Ms. Zhu, for her part, said she would keep her Snapchat account shut down, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us who can tell you that's not true".
Congress panel says military officials have been denying ISIS intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a congressional panel reported that the United States Central Command officials have tampered with intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war on the ground against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
An interim report by a working group of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Award Subcommittee chairmen, compiled by the Republican board, found "a widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts who said the U.S. forces had changed their assessment of the Islamic State.
Centcom, known as Central Command, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A news release on the report stated: "The intelligence results endorsed by senior Centcom leaders typically paint a more positive picture than the facts on the ground show about the U.S. counterterrorism efforts, and consistently yield much more positive results than analysis by other elements of the intelligence community".
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable, our combat troops are suffering when we give bad analyses to senior decision makers", said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The leadership failures at Centcom are at the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015, which included the Central Command's explanation and analysis of the U.S. training efforts for Iraqi forces.
Although there is no clear evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered the reports to be changed, analysts are reportedly pressured by Centcom leaders to offer a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and Daesh.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than actual events", the report states.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military strike to retake Mosul could be carried out as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under Islamic State control.
Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas said in a statement, "After months of research, this issue has become quite clear".
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the most senior intelligence leaders of the United States Central Command manipulated the intelligence results of the command to make the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq seem insignificant.
The Republicans formed a working group after learning that analysts had expressed concerns about intelligence manipulation of the Islamic State.
As the studies continue, the report, published Thursday, will follow up on much more detailed findings.
There's another Centcom intelligence review being conducted by the Department of Defense's inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee also released their findings on Thursday, which included some of the findings of the Republican working group.
Democratic Chairman of the committee Representative Adam B. Schiff said in a statement that "between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an extremely narrow-minded process in intelligence assessments of the Daesh and Iraqi Security Forces".
Mr Schiff said the process "delayed the publication of intelligence results", led to moral disruption among analysts, and "did not give enough room for conflicting views".
However, Mr Schiff and Democrats said they had not reached a conclusion that the White House was pressuring Centcom analysts to fabricate "a predetermined or political narrative" of the findings.
The preliminary results of the congressional review were announced by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector general review was in place following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that he would not comment on the Department of Defense congressional report during the inspector general's review process.
But he said "experts may disagree on the interpretation of complex data in some cases and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense support a healthy dialogue on these important national security issues".
The investigation will raise the question of whether the US-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria is continuing (a claim made by more and more defense officials every day).
But last year's allegations raised the question of how much President Obama can trust the Central Command to make honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence reflection began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article in which he argued that the administration of President George W. Bush advocated a small force in Iraq despite opposition from many analysts and that he did not think enough about the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, and has been debated for more than a decade.
Mr. Hooker also played a major role in the Islamic State's intelligence insurgency.
Authorities said that despite public statements by Mr. Hooker's team in the opposite direction last year, the airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly affected the terrorist group's financial resources, as they had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But as The Times reported in September, this finding has not been outside of Central Command.
Centcom's then-commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, last year's Senate announcement was criticized by many lawmakers as an overwhelmingly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was succeeded by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. Women 's National Team has won their fourth consecutive World Cup
Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the United States women's field hockey team in a 3-0 win over India on Thursday, a day after she scored three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan.
Although five goals in two matches seem to require a permanent mastery of mind, Bam, 27, said he was not sure if he had done the same before.
He said, "I have no idea".
I'm not the type of person who keeps a record of his goals.
What he knows is that the Americans share a 4-0 lead in the Olympic tournament and a group lead with Britain, who are on their way to a 2-0 defeat to Japan on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face each other for the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals, and the match will determine which of the six teams will finish first and second.
The team that finishes first in the group will not face the strong Dutch team, who will lead another group when the quarter-finals begin.
But after Saturday's game, the Americans made a sensation here by showing amazing progress after the London Olympics, where they came last among 12 teams.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; he was 3 when he first picked up his lawn hockey bat (his twin sisters were interested in the sport at Drexel) and became the youngest player on the team at age 16, joining the national team.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012 when most things didn't go well for him and his teammates.
The following year, a British coach, Craig Parnham, was brought in and things began to change.
Bam says, "It's a cultural change, a mental change, a physical change".
We don't work like we do in London anymore.
We've been through a complete transformation.
Thursday night, Bam took the first number one of the first day with a close-up shot.
India had not yet won a tournament but the team showed an amazing level of resilience and managed to keep the score 1-0 until the third quarter when Bam came on board.
He made a long run with the ball from the left side of the field and then curled up and threw the ball into the fortress, leading the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final goal midway through the fourth quarter.
This was the first match in which United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who allowed a goal in his first three victories, did not score in the tournament.
It's his chance.
So is Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place right now", but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trambolin cold in the midst of Olympic ambition
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious competition and work, and it seems as though it will never end or be avoided.
The Olympic torch itself is like a flaming baton that is passed from swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't watch TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor in a cafe without hearing about the quarrel between Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who is a first-time Olympian, among sponsorships and TV commercials that encourage you to feel good, is probably one of the names shown during prime time hours for a gamble-like heartbeat, such as a swimmer, gymnast, or skater.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for the Olympic gold medal in trampoline.
The Olympic flame doesn't illuminate every event equally.
Far from the center, in the shadows, there are some universally unrecognized sports: high-flying rifle shooting, archery, badminton, tekvando.
The frog will always be with us, and long to be.
But if I must say personally that I'm a favorite, I'd like to point out the secret magic of the trampoline.
Although trambolin has been recognized as an Olympic sport since it was introduced at the Sydney Games in 2000, very few people I've asked in the last 16 years have realized it's an Olympic sport.
This could be regional ignorance.
The United States sent athletes to compete but never won a medal on the trampoline and was not a finalist until 2012.
The prize was for men, Chinese and Russians, and for women, Chinese and Canadians.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will try to protect the gold medals they received in London this year.
But trambolin is usually noted as a disgusting activity, partly because unconscious ears may think it's worth the clown school instead of the Olympics.
I must admit I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested in the subject.
It has a comic potential (like the cartoon-like vibration created by the never-ending jump) but it also reflects the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it basically combines.
The word "trambolin" comes from the Spanish word hand trampoline, which means "tramplen".
The champion candidates jump almost 30 feet from the air on a large trampoline and are asked to perform a series of moves (burk, pike, and jump) before they can get on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are judged by performance, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries will compete in Rio, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common advancement at the Olympics is straight forward.
Those hoping to win the medal must go further, faster and higher, in some cases, to the finish, in some cases, backwards, upside down.
Not only are they chasing the finish line or the start wall, but there's another tough line on TV: the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined effort is noble, irresistible, and even extreme, enough to drown even an audience in tears.
But this is one of the features I find a little tiring when I watch the Games.
Trambolin allows you to take a break from all this.
The trolley's moving up.
Their goals are not forward movement.
He jumps upwards, looks like an astronaut, looks like a weightless man, goes up, goes down, and goes up again without effort.
Of course, it's not to say there's no competition or difficulty, but during routine, there's no hard work to get results, no distance lost, just gracefully suspended time and gravity like a dream.
The more quiet an Olympic race can be, the more quiet it can be.
The women's qualifiers and the final will be held on Friday afternoon at 13:00 Eastern time, followed by the men's on Saturday at 13:00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as a block on both days starting at 2 p.m.
They're promising a quiet and wonderful moment in the midst of the Olympic madness that can be ignored in general.
And if the consciousness of the United States is to increase, according to The Wall Street Journal, by offering male athletes just to filter and objectify their eyes, as male gymnasts recently suggested, we can say that Mr. Dooley is expecting new fans.
"A Generation of Protests" in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
In Ethiopia, protesters demanding political change faced fierce resistance from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters have been fatally shot in clashes with police.
Ethiopia is about to collapse?
In the past decade, it has become one of Africa's most stable nations and a strong ally to the West with its rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to more and more regions every day.
Just last week, thousands took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response to this was quite brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed numerous unarmed protesters.
The protests, believed to have taken place late last year or early this year, show security officials beating young people who have to keep their hands against a wall.
The highest-level UN human rights official is now asking for a detailed review.
Rashid Abdi, the Somali Peninsula project director of the International Crisis Group, a research group, said: "It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward".
Ethiopia is one of Africa's most populous nations after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, primarily Somalia, and there are few countries in Africa that receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing impressively.
The infrastructure has been improved effectively; a new suburban train is also available in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia did not show the best example of democracy (human rights groups consistently refer to the government's repressive attitude), domestic opposition was quite limited, effectively silencing the opposition.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven to the far corners of the desert.
But that may be about to change.
"If you drown people and give them no choice but to protest, these events will happen", said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia.
Youth is in complete protest.
A generation of protest.
There are many complaints, from land use to the pressure on power by the coalition in power.
After the highly critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies also took the last seat filled by the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising on the border with Eritrea, a fierce and contentious line that led to a war in June that killed hundreds.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Freedom Front or Ogaden National Freedom Front, which have disappeared in recent years, will rearm using this turbulence.
There are several factors that explain why the painful feelings that have been boiling beneath the surface for years are now exploding.
The first one seems innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones became more common and internet access became available, only a few years ago large numbers of Ethiopians began to communicate using social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often did during protests, most people could communicate through internet proxy servers that concealed their location.
Several young Ethiopians said they were assembled in this way for protests.
Second, there was increased solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, two of Ethiopia's major ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not normally allies.
For a very long time, the Amhara, from the predominantly Christian mountainous regions of Ethiopia, were prominent in politics and business, exploiting the mostly Muslim Oromo people living in the plains.
But that's changing too.
Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader, said: "We are moving towards cooperation under one umbrella".
The largest protests were in Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group Tigrayan, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Mr Meles served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was thought to be a tactical genius, seeing what everyone couldn't see.
Analysts say he is particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of unrest and reassuring and disabling opponents.
"The current regime does not have this basic knowledge", said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn was elected in relative uncertainty to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who is from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he has not gained the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigrayans.
As a result, more fear and more bloodshed.
Ethiopia's latest experience of such a mess was in 2005, when thousands of analysts protested the thefts that followed a failed election by the government.
In the ensuing measures, many protesters were killed, although less than a month ago, and this period of turmoil has also passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning such as the new suburban train and significant progress in fighting poverty.
But that clearly did not stop the growing anger against the Ethiopian government.
And it's becoming dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and hatred of Tigrays has also increased on social media.
Analysts say the protests have left the United States and other Western allies in a strange position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, but it was recently reported that the base was closed.
The West clearly wants to support democracy, but it doesn't want this alliance in a fragile region to be torn apart.
Mr. Abdi said, "It's like walking on a very thin rope".
Donald Trump called Obama's commitment to the establishment of ISIS "a mockery"
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to eliminate the last dispute surrounding his campaign by insisting several times last week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group, suggesting they were not serious.
This statement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
He also put his deputies in a strange position when they tried to explain that he was not implying that he was doing everything he could to defend him in this tumultuous process.
Mr. Trump, after making this proposal at a rally on Wednesday night, reinforced the thesis on Thursday and insisted in interviews that it really implied that President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton had founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Mr. Trump said he was making only a derisive statement.
The message showed that Mr. Trump had completely backed down the day before he had said in a series of interviews that he was serious about the charge.
Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt reminded him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, and when Mr. Trump tried to help him soften that comment, the Republican presidential nominee said he didn't believe it.
Mr. Trump's latest confusion came as he tried to shift the focus of his campaign after the drop in polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had conflicting talks about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back to that.
He tweeted again that Mrs Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and that he found his speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used a defense of ridicule before.
He said that he had made the comments "of course I said it in a derogatory way" after facing major criticism in late July after showing a video suggesting that the Russians had hacked Ms. Clinton's emails.
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political speech and step back where it needs to be.
Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who tracks the language used by both candidates, said: "This is a system that allows him to 'explain' in some way, depending on the response, by testing how certain messages are reacted to by those who support him".
But at the same time, he's giving these statements deliberately and knows that they're vague enough to be filtered out from different angles.
After a recent drop in polls, Mr. Trump has taken a much more aggressive stance than to soften the air for the general election crowd.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published on Friday showed that Mr. Trump was far behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and that there was a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump often avoids apologizing for his provocative words, he accuses his critics of misrepresenting his words or misunderstanding his humor.
But Mr. Trump's jokes, which have been subject to much more scrutiny in the final months of his presidential campaign, leave his loyal supporters in a difficult position to support him publicly, as provocative as his comments may be.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most outspoken supporters, did his best to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
When asked about the veracity of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he's making a legitimate, political criticism".
In a way, before Obama, ISIS was a small, unknown organization, and those who liked it were completely wrong, and that was because of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, under Mrs. Clinton, as secretary of state, has failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and has caused the growth of ISIS.
In the run-up to Friday's rally in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse the news media on Twitter of twisting every word and acting biased against him.
"They can't do that!" he said, mocking the "poor, pathetic" TV experts who tried to solve him.
Some Democrats have mocked Mr. Trump's pretext, saying it is evidence that he is unfit for the presidency.
Once Priceless Cafe With Us Again at Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe, an old cash-only place in Williamsburg, didn't offer Wi-Fi, but it did offer great coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, he couldn't handle the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
In the summer of 2014, the shop that replaced Verb, Soap Cherie, sold soap in the form of a cupcake.
The residents complained that this was the last loss of the decorated city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "New York is a change, I know that, but I still can't believe that CBGB is gone and Chelsea Hotel is empty and Verb is no longer a soap shop".
But New York is as much a city of reinvention as it is a change.
A renovated Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location, last November.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi connectivity and accepts credit cards but retains some of its former employees and similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verb is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, longtime employee of the old cafe, who also owns and manages the new location.
He joined Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
He said that when a client offered him financing for this new place, he would be excited to do so.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, left most of it the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for the cements and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
In fact, the lights of the old Verb have been reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer a little different experience.
He added new materials.
The baked-egg-and-cheese sandwich menu includes ingredients such as capari and sold onions.
They have a little bit of a mermaid-soup box.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but it does serve fresh fruit juice.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed that former defenders were beginning to come in firmly.
"Many of our former customers were unable to cope with the prices in Williamsburg", he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Mrs. Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and was a frequent visitor to the Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he didn't stop moving on.
He said he took a break from coffee for a while after the verb closed.
"I realized what I love is the coffee and culture in the Verb".
He started drinking coffee again, but the other day he chose a tea blend with a new addition instead of his usual iced coffee.
Another defendant, Tom Rosenthal, has been a regular visitor to the Verb since 2003.
He goes there before work and he always orders the same thing.
"Every day, I would come in at seven o'clock, not surprised, and they would prepare my daily butter simit order".
Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to make changes and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, although Mr. Rosenthal still takes his usual order, he sometimes makes a few changes to his daily order of cider by adding to it baking, eggs and cheese.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't concerned about the soap store that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie have offered to make a special soap for Verb using the coffee's cold brew.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer".
And the traditional Polish people of Greenpoint adopted this coffee.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he would soon find a place to display it so that his new neighbors would feel good about themselves.
There are other advantages to the new position.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
There's a possibility the cafe could be expanded into the building next door.
For most clients, it's enough to have a new verb available to find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and was very upset when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Mr. Whitt said that getting in and having coffee made him feel at home.
"I should have smelled it", she said.
The Depression of the Crisis in A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after taking his seat as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
A lover of his throat, President Roosevelt loved the lavish Fifth Avenue food like goose liver crush and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu for that day was much more modest: roasted eggs with tomato sauce, potatoes and sweet, dry-meal pudding.
Jane Ziegelman said, "It was an act of solidarity with those who suffered from eating disorders".
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
They're a food historian living in Brooklyn Heights.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman, in her book, "97 Orchard", was about living on a nightclub in the Lower East Side through food.
Their new book, A Square Meal, which will be published by Harper's on Tuesday, tells the story of American food during the Great Depression.
They also met a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in Flatiron, where they had been serving food since 1929, the year the crisis began.
Mrs. Ziegelman (54), who ordered cream cheese and olive sandwiches, preferred to have Mr. Coe (57), turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's roll of the pie order appropriate for discussion of the crisis meal.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "The salmon were very popular".
There was peanuts, liver, dry bean.
These were made of a cheap material that spread the material.
Imagine you're eating enough peanuts for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he's got his face covered.
"It must have been sitting in the belly of a man like a bullet".
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, tables in America were like open buffets.
Women cooked for the men who worked on the farm, and freshly baked cakes were served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans sent food to Europeans starving to death in World War I. "A Square Meal" tells the story of how the nation suddenly emerged from being a center of plenty.
Mr. Coe explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it, saying, "It was a time when food became a central concern for Americans".
The new budget regime was equally worrying: mysterious foods like salmon and sausages became staples, and, according to Ms. Ziegelman, "sweets were a great way to evaluate leftover foods", so chefs could hide the under-appetite suppressants with a cream sauce lid.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Over the years, the meat that was at the heart of American cuisine became a luxury, a sentimental, distributed dish.
Interesting mixtures were tried for calorie and nutritional value, and the sense of satiety was overtaken by taste or the general concept of cooking.
Mrs. Ziegelman was researching her book, which included recipes, and she made an onion dish in a baking oven filled with peanut butter from that era.
Mr. Coe said, "This dinner was not a favorite addition to the table".
Ms. Ziegelman supported it, saying, "That was surreal".
Peanut butter has nothing in common with baked onions.
It was a prominent feature of most home economics recipes.
Home economists, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Housing Economics, guided the country's eating habits like never before between 1923 and 1943.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "expert" and spread the fight to turn soups, such as carrot-creamed spaghetti, into delicious foods.
A Square Meal is a feast of historic treats.
The government's response to starving citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's "let go, eat cake" attitude, is extremely appetizing.
He praised the simple Iowa farmer's food of his childhood in public, while on the other hand he ate like a million-something intellectual he had turned into.
Mr. Coe said, "He loved to eat European cuisine, like salad dressings".
He ate his meals in a dining room almost entirely covered with gold, wearing coats suitable for his dinner.
It was far from the truth.
If his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to be a role model with his stomach, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
According to the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an assistant who gave no thought to taste, the White House began to offer "not only the saddest dishes ever prepared, but also the saddest dishes ever prepared".
After the country regained its feet, most of the crisis-era cooking methods were put on hold.
According to Ms. Ziegelman, the understanding of calories and nutrition and the way science is applied to cooking continues.
The couple said that while writing the book, they learned a lot from Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - for example, she never threw food away.
Mr. Coe said, "The food was really scaring him".
Mrs. Ziegelman said of her past memories, "It really made people sick".
There was a cream doughnut incident.
After the plates were collected at Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe brought out a home-cooked dessert: the dry-meat dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a dry-cured man", said Mrs. Ziegelman, adding that the most frequently asked number was to give these modest recipes a cool name.
There was no whipped cream, just dry yolk, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone hesitated to dip their spoon in the brown sticker.
Surprisingly, it wasn't too bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoon.
He said to his wife, "A little bit of chopped nuts would be good".
Gilead will get lawyer fees in the patent fight between Merck and Hepatitis C.
In a decision by a U.S. district judge, Gilead Sciences Inc. won the right to receive attorney fees in a hepatitis C patent lawsuit filed with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc.
After U.S. District Judge Merck was found to have engaged in a series of misconduct, including false testimony and other unethical practices, Gilead was disqualified in June from paying $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents for Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni.
At Thursday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead was entitled to compensation for the fees incurred during the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, the market leader, with the next generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case is based on a 2013 lawsuit between Gilead and Merck over ownership of laboratory studies for the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs, sofosbuvir.
US-backed forces say that control of the village has been completely taken away from Islamic State
On Friday, the group's spokesman said US-backed forces had also seized full control of the northern city of Membich, near the Turkish border, by the latest Islamic State fighters inside the city.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) is also in the process of clearing the city after a group of militants who remained hiding in the city were evacuated.
Sharfan Dervish, a member of the Civilian Military Council in alliance with the SDG, told Reuters that they had released over 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants.
He told Routers: "The city is now completely under our control but we are doing cleanup work".
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, and they paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released a 2015 tax return showing that the Democratic presidential nominee and his wife earned $10.75 million last year and paid federal taxes at 34.2 percent, which is in effect.
In 2015, the Clinton family donated $1 million to charities, most of which were the Clinton Foundation, earned nearly $5.3 million from former President Bill Clinton's speech fees, and the former Secretary of State reported earning $3 million for his book, published by Simon & Schuster, about his time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton have released a 10-year tax return.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
Clinton campaign manager Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency".
Instead, Donald Trump is hiding behind false arguments about his earlier promise to declare his tax returns and backtracking.
It's a tradition that US presidential candidates file tax returns publicly, even though they don't require it.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers said the reason for the refusal was a audit by the Revenue Service.
In connection with the Democratic candidate's remarks, Clinton campaign manager Ian Sams tweeted "It's your turn".
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to broadcast them until the audits were complete.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans in 2012, said the rejection posed questions about his own self-absorption, contributions to charities, business deals, and many other connections, including those with Russia.
Clinton went on to address the issue by posting an online video on Friday showing senior Republicans pressuring Trump to declare taxes.
He raised the issue in an economic talk in Michigan on Thursday.
He told the crowd, "He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, to publish tax returns".
Politico reported that Trump paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, a columnist for the New York Times business section shared comments from a number of tax attorneys and accountants that the situation could still continue this way.
Federal tax rates have become a major issue in the presidential election.
Clinton proposed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would allow those earning over $1 million a year to pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Obama supports that proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, the Berkshire Hathaway group challenged Buffett, who operates there, to come to Trump and file a tax return.
Buffet said he was also undergoing IRS scrutiny and that Trump was "scared" not of the tax collector's office but of the voters.
Clinton published his campaign tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate is about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton family's 2015 statement shows that, unlike most Americans, their income comes from wages of only $100.
The parent is a low-cost index fund, and the Clintons have reported a base and interest income of $109,000.

Powdered red pepper condoms, chestnut fireworks support elephant conservation in Tanzania
To prevent elephants from entering human habitations, environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method: they throw red pepper-dusted condoms at them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which founded the idea a few years ago, and the U.S.-based Nature Conservancy Association, took the initiative to promote it, training volunteers in rural northern Tanzania to use the nonviolent, four-step method of protecting their homes and crops from harm to animals.
In the past, most people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement, "We've seen attitudes in these communities change since we developed the vehicle set, and they're more confident they can keep elephants off their land without harming them".
The first two steps involve holding the elephant's flashlight and playing the horn.
When that's not possible, what's called a red pepper cloud is thrown away.
The powdered red pepper mixed with the soil is placed in the condom with a chestnut shot, and the tip is closed so that the funnel remains open.
When it's burned, the condom opens with a blast and the red pepper is sprayed into the air as dust.
One breath is enough to send elephants in the opposite direction.
The last option is to use a firecracker that throws a tornado into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker knocks down a Berlin hotel that has been stripped of Israel's phone code over Arab "demand" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin caused a media sensation after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code and that the employee was suggesting "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary "Shoah" about the Holocaust, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German broadcasting agency FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel during his recent stay.
But the country was not among the states that could be directly called from the room.
In 2016, how can Israel be neutralized and destroyed in the new German capital of Berlin?
It was Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the option of calling Israel through its own call center.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel reception for an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that the response he received "shocked him".
The hotel's secretary said the move was "a deliberate decision of the Kempinski-Hotels management".
The underlying cause of this move has made the filmmaker even more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, "Many of our guests wanted the Arabic and Israeli code to be deleted".
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's German ambassador, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the situation "a great shame".
This appalled us and surprised us.
This is a real shame.
It's a much bigger disgrace that this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this.
There's no need to explain it.
We expect the hotel to draw the necessary conclusions from this".
The incident sparked a huge online reaction, which people called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of "subjecting" to the claims of Arab customers.
Another post included the phrase "You should be ashamed" with the emphasis that the hotel is located near a synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly dropped the charges, saying the incident was the result of "carelessness" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reported that one of Kempinski's representatives said "there was no direct order to exclude Israel from the rapid search list".
And now he says they've added the code.
Police used pepper and plastic bullets against Brazilian students protesting
Students gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday to protest government reforms of the public education system clashed with police.
Police used pepper gas and plastic bullets against protesters.
The problem started when security officers tried to disperse students, which led to police using plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express their displeasure with the plans.
Under the proposal of Sao Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed to save money and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools.
Some of the protesters were seen writing against the walls of the country's interim president, Michel Temer.
The latest protests came a few days after protesters took to the streets in crowds to support the ousted President Dilma Rousseff, who was ousted by the country's Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran rose by 71 percent - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade circle between Moscow and Tehran has grown at a rate of 70.9 percent year-on-year since the lifting of sanctions.
The ambassador said that since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, the interest of Russian companies doing business in the country has increased significantly.
While new companies are preparing to gain market access, Russian companies are maintaining existing ties with Iran.
Of course, further increase in trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran", Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, he said the trade circle between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
This increase in trade was achieved by machinery, ground tools and equipment for weapons", the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Embassy in Iran issued 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly for travel.
Also, for the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say that the record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia last year will be broken".
At the same time, relatively fewer Russians visit Iran, a subject the ambassador hopes to change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved", he said.
Cash to FETÖ from Izmir - Economic News
Interesting details about Kavuklar Group's Chairman Abdullah Kavuk and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Küçükbay Group Ahmet Küçükbay, who were detained for providing financial support to FETÖ, began to emerge.
It was found that FETÖ's financial sources No. 1 and No. 2 in Izmir, Küçükbay and Kavuk, regularly sent courier-loaded amounts of money to FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization leader Fethullah Gülen every month.
It was found that the money sent to Gülen was not deposited through banks, but was sent through the organization's courier.
On the other hand, 9 people were arrested in Amasya, including Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Fatih Altınay, who were taken to court and released under the conditions of judicial review.
30 thousand liras in the 10-year term
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call to "lower the banking sector" has taken action.
It was suggested that banks be included in the campaign initiative initiated by the real estate agency, which was later joined by GYODER.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also proposed that the housing loan interest rates, which are considered psychological limits, be lower than 1 percent.
13 banks have reduced their mortgage interest rates below 1 percent.
It was the public banks that started the discount riot.
With the latest adjustment, which has been based on monthly interest rates that have previously ranged from 1.12 to 1.29 percent, consumers using 10-year term housing loans will pay less interest between 15 and 30 billion TL.
5 to 10 years
So how much benefit will the interest rate cuts bring to those who buy a house?
A person using a ten-year loan of 100,000 pounds will have an advantage of 30,000 pounds over the fall in interest.
The vast majority of home loan users choose a five to 10 year repayment plan.
Interest rates are expected to drop further in the coming days.
The interest rate cut will also have a positive impact on sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 percent to 1 million 289 thousand.
Sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million this year with interest rate discounts.
GYODER President Aziz Torun: The annual rate should be lowered to 9 percent
It's a big step for public banks to go for interest rates.
They listened to our president's call and cut interest.
But that should fall below 9 percent a year.
If this discount process continues, we're considering extending the 0.70 percent monthly campaign we've started for a few months.
Sheep Group YKU Ozen Sheep: Our campaign can extend for 3 months
The involvement of banks in this effort to bring dynamism to the economy we limit to one month could lead to an extension of this historic campaign for at least three to four months.
But the interest rate on the loan should fall below 9 percent on an annual basis.
It is pleasing to see that not only the housing sector and the real market will be affected by this positive psychology and the unprecedented solidarity that will be created, but also that every sector is making sacrifices in the purchase of housing by citizens.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a nice step for our president to go to the banks for interest rate cuts.
In addition, there are steps to be taken in all sectors to revive the economy.
The campaigns of the STKs, the decision of the Central Bank and all the steps taken in this direction for the country...
All banks should be getting their hands on the ground.
We're telling them, come on, join us in this movement, walk with us, walk with us, and let's all live together.
Investment of 5.5 billion TL in 1.5 years from Sabancı
Sabancı Holding increased its net profit by 11 percent in the first six months of this year to 1 billion 353 million liras, and its sales increased by 22 percent to 17 billion 166 million liras.
CEO Zafer Kurtul reported that they invested 1.8 billion TL in the first six months of the year and about 5.5 billion liras from the beginning of 2015.
Survivor: "As a country, we have successfully passed through a difficult time in recent times".
"It's time for our country to work and produce more", he said.
Two years off from Kabatach to enjoy the boat
Due to the "Kabataş Square Reorganization, Transfer Center and Rebuilding of the Shipyards" carried out by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB), the Kabataş shipping ports were closed to maritime traffic for about two years.
A modern transfer centre will be built on the coast of Kabataş, integrating maritime, railway and road transport.
Traffic will be grounded to ensure a continuous footprint along the coast.
The tram and funicular systems will continue to operate for a while.
Ring trips will be launched to ensure citizens' access to the regions of Taksim, Eminonu, and Beşiktaş.
Interest rate fell, house collapsed
A friend of mine, a public bank manager, texted me.
It's always the same.
Interest rates are falling, house prices are rising.
Interest rates are going up, house prices are going down.
"Look, it's like this again", she says.
She's telling me how she feels about her job being about personal loans.
He says that contractors who joined the real estate housing campaign at a 0.70 percent rate have increased prices on many housing projects.
I've been looking for a fair share.
She's not in a position, she's not much of a gender...
And then I remembered a conversation with a contractor who attended a construction summit organized by our newspaper a week after the July 15 coup attempt by the Fatah terrorist organization.
The boss of a big company...
When I heard the unnamed contractor say, "You really have to increase prices by 10 percent", I said, "Are you going to do a little bit of opportunism?"
Following the coup attempt, the builders launched a large sales campaign with a 0.70 percent and 120 month duration.
I admit, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, took the risk.
But as long as we are moving in a spirit of unity and solidarity to keep Turkey going.
The banks have also supported your month-long campaign by lowering interest rates.
Then no one should be pushing the envelope.
And warn those who do among you.
President Erdoğan accepted Omar Koch and Ali Koch
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Koch Holding's Chairman of the Board of Directors, Omar Mehmet Koch, and Koch Holding's Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Ford Otosan Chairman Ali Koch welcomed.
Erdoğan's reception in the Presidential Asylum lasted 40 minutes.
Call from BDDK: complain to those banks
The Chairman of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority (BDDK), Mehmet Ali Akben, made a statement regarding President Erdoğan's warning to banks to "recall credit".
Akben said, "If banks are using credit recalls as an opportunistic means to change market conditions, we will not allow it".
We tell those who bring us such complaints and information, 'Please contact the BDDK complaint line by giving names on the basis of the bank and the company'.
In his statement yesterday, President Tayyip Erdogan warned the banks: "I say that when interest rates fall, when credit facilities are expanded, a new period will open up for our country and our investors and our banks".
If we refuse to lend at this time in our country, it means that banks that are recalling loans with fabricated excuses have set themselves a line, and I want to announce that.
Banks made money from these jobs when interest rates were 7-8 percent a year.
Over 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
Ali Kızılddağ, President of the Association of Professional Hotel Managers (POYD), said that Turkey-Russia relations have entered a positive path ahead of the July 15 coup attempt at the EXPO 2016 Antalya exhibition area, that fare flights from Russia to Antalya have begun and that there is a certain revival in tourism.
Expressing that the meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin has excited the tourism sector as well as the trade sectors between the two countries, Kızıldag said, "I expect very positive developments in all sectors, from tourism to agriculture to food, construction to textiles".
Turkey and Russia are two very close countries, we have traditional relations based on years.
"I think if we as sectors move very quickly along this path that the leaders of the two countries have set, we can close the distance and move towards the goals".
In addition, the Turkish authorities estimated that the number of Russian tourists arriving in Turkey would exceed 1 million if there were no coup attempt.
But we lost a month in what we call high season, so the target is down.
I still think if charter flights start, we'll be over 500,000.
And it could be until the end of October or even mid-November.
In that case, additional flights could be scheduled for Christmas.
I expect this positive atmosphere will be very well appreciated by the Russian people.
They have a yearning for Turkey.
I'm thinking, hopefully, with this rush, we can force 700,000.
In terms of the Russian market, the Russian tourist population could rise to over 3 million next year, he said.
Poyd President Kızıldag said that with the lifting of the ban on public personnel, domestic reservations started small, "There are returns on cancelled reservations, new reservations have also begun to be taken".
"We have a very hopeful expectation for the Feast of Sacrifice".
He also said that the lifting of the ban on tour tickets sold by Iran to travel agents after the coup attempt was a very positive development, saying, "It would be great if we could bring 100-200 thousand people from Iran every 1,2-2 months".
Are you a newbie with an existing loan?
First, consult the bank you borrowed and find out how the new interest rates affect your loan.
Calculate the cost of using a new loan at a lower interest rate, along with the early closing fee (up to 1.5-2 percent of the usual fee).
If you still have the advantage of including all costs, you can apply for a low-interest loan.
No breathing in the lion!
The last champion Beşiktaş aims to enter the new season with a moral entrance by winning the Super Cup match against Galatasaray.
Technical Director Shenol Güneş, who set all his plans on victory, said in his interview with the demands, "We must play temporous and aggressive".
He used the phrase, "I expect you to have a high passing percentage and 90 minutes of ball control".
It was learned that the players who missed the games, including Sosa, were not planning to take the field, and that Sun was uncertain about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced coach tried Necip at the stop in weekly practice, but if Adriano plays left-back, Tosic will take over at the stop.
The Sun, who would also be a choice between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also had his demands run the ball after a long pause.
The wave is going to blow .
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek answered the questions of media members at a dinner hosted by NEF sponsoring Galatasaray the previous evening and supported the expatriate footballer Tolga Ciğerci, whose transfer and annual fee are also a matter of debate.
I 'm not going to be a football player
Dursun Özbek, who said the football team is much better than last year, said, "But it's not me who needs to talk about it, it's the players on the pitch", adding, "I can't say anything".
I'll take a look at the teams for a couple weeks, then I can tell you our chances for a championship.
I'm expecting an explosion from Tolga.
You'll see Tolga in his stature, in his physics, and he'll explode this year, and everyone will be watching with admiration.
Galatasaray President stressed that they had contacted Mehmet Topal during the transfer period but that they would take office if he did not agree with his club and said: "We were not intending to charge so that our rival would increase the price".
Mehmetal is a gentleman, a master athlete.
If he didn't make a deal with the club, we'd like to transfer him to Galatasaray.
We 're going to sell bank notes to RIVA
Uzbek said that the construction of the hall next to TT Arena will begin soon, "We wanted to build a hall for 13 thousand people".
But our president said, 'Build a hall for 15,000 people.'
We changed the plan.
We'll pay off the bank debt with the money from Riva.
What we are
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek, who said he believed that the team that won the Turkish Cup last season would show its quality in the Super Cup final against Beşiktaş tomorrow, made a statement with a slogan at the yellow-red club.
"May is ours", said President Uzbek, saying that he believes Galatasaray will be champion again after a year.
Deployment ban lifted
The Club Association Foundation has signed a historic resolution at its meeting yesterday.
At the meeting, which was the agenda of the July 15 coup attempt, there was a consensus on the lifting of the ban on movement.
From the new season, in the matches between the four majors and the Beşiktaş-Bursaspor games, the guest team fans will be able to take their places in the stands.
The Foundation's President Göksel Gümüşdag said: "We have decided to lift the ban on storage in order to continue the unity and solidarity that has formed after July 15".
"We believe that this unity and solidarity is of much greater importance after the 15 July Martyrs of Democracy", he said.
The vote on the clubs' association foundation will continue to serve the current board.
Galatasaray Club President Dursun Özbek was elected chairman of the board.
Unlike previous meetings, the club flame was not on the table.
The table was equipped with Turkish flags to emphasize the unity and unity of Turkey.
"We Will Clean Ourselves Up"
The President of the Clubs' Association Göksel Gümüşdag said that those who tried a treacherous attack on the indivisible integrity of Turkey found a great Turkish nation in front of them.
"As a football family, we must clean and tidy our own garden", he said.
Gümüşdag asked a question on the form "Do you think of an organization called the 15 July Democracy Cup?" and "There is a general opinion among friends about the name of the Turkish Cup in particular".
He used the phrase "We'll share this offer with TFF".
Target 25,000 combined
Trabzonspor will fight in the new stadium in the new season.
The head of bordomavils, Muharrem Usta, who counted the days to move to Akyazi, determined the combined prices through a survey on social media.
Fans are expected to be keen on the available blends, which are aiming to sell 25,000 combines and 100,000 uniforms in the new season.
The president said, "Goal 25,000 combinations and over 100,000 uniforms".
We agreed on the price of the castle and the east/west stands.
Good luck to you.
He used the phrase "you've got the ball now".
The new season's combined prices for the Bordo-blue club were set as follows: "The combined prices for the up-and-down stands behind the castle are 350 TL, while the east stands and west stands are 750 TL".
The new season uniform worth 150 liras will be given as a gift to the combined participants, while the students will receive a 30 percent discount for the combined participants and their spouse in the second combined.
South Korea 's silence officially unveiled
Trabzonspor had a deal with Hyun Jun Suk of South Korea on everything.
A player who is hired by Porto for one year will be paid a temporary transfer fee of 750 thousand euros.
The player will also be paid a guaranteed fee of 1 million euros per year.
The player's purchase option was set at 15 million euros.
He was fired with a book-book account.
F. Bahçe sent Pereira, who signed a two-year contract on 11 June 2015, at the end of his first year.
President Aziz Yıldırım and the board of directors held a meeting with the club's financial affairs coordinator Tamer Yelkovan.
The economic dimension of the meeting was laid on the table.
Under the agreement with UEFA, Yıldırım, who is sensitive to keeping "annual losses" at a level, reportedly received financial assistance from Yelkovan.
He's contacted Pereira's representatives.
It has been announced that his mission will be terminated.
2 to 2.5 MILLION ON EURO
There are still some unresolved issues regarding financial matters, so it was stated that the official announcement will be made today or tomorrow.
Pereira and his team went to the gym with the team yesterday, so no official announcement was made.
The total cost of this operation was about 4 million euros.
However, it was stated that F. Bahçe would provide a figure agreement for the liquidation below this price.
If F. Bahçe pays Pereira's salary in advance, he'll finish a figure-making job worth between 2 and 2.5 million euros.
If Pereira doesn't take this approach, the salary will be paid monthly.
If he makes a deal with a team, that's cutting it.
Yes, Pereira finally left and the Fenerbahçe supporters signed a major revolution.
In the battle against Vitor Pereira, Caner the Free, Luis Nani was martyred.
Robin van Persie was treated with minor injuries.
I'm going to be very happy that Vitor Pereira is gone, I think our administration will find it worse.
My joy is in my purse.
The champion Fenerbahce is going to Pereira.
You can now take Vitor Pereira's suitcase and go with a 3-5-2.
He went to Kadıköy at 18, according to Pereira.
Serdar Chakir has been dismissed
It was learned that Serdar Çakır, a top-class referee observer in the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), was removed from his post.
The fact that Serdar Chakir, the father of FIFA referee Juneyt Chakir, who is currently serving as an umpire at the Rio Olympics, was brought to the court last year has sparked controversy.
In the TFF, the Central Board of Judges (CBO), the Board of Arbitration and the boards of representatives and observers were re-established in the past days within the FETÖ.
The smile on the face of Van Persie
Minutes after Pereira's claim to be terminated, Dutch star Robin van Persie posted a fake post on his Facebook account.
Robin van Persie, who shared photos of himself at Fenerbahçe, has a football and a smile icon.
The post was interpreted as "Rejoicing with Pereira's departure".
The first independent gold in history was won by Al-Deehani
Fehaid el-Deehani, who finished first in the shot put category at the 2016 Rio Olympics, brought the first gold medal to independent athletes in the history of the games.
Medals were awarded in the double trap category at the Olympic Shooting Center.
Al-Deehani, 49, who competed in the Games with the Independent Olympic Athletics Team due to a penalty imposed on his country Kuwait, faced Marco Innocenti of Italy in the double trap final.
Al-Deehani, who defeated his opponent by a score of 26-24, became the first name to win a gold medal with an independent team at the Olympics.
I opened a door for the headaches
Doaa Elghobashy, an Egyptian who competed in the women's beach volleyball cap at the 2016 Rio Olympics, said: "I respect those who play in bikini, and my competitors respect the cap".
Elghobashy, who said he wanted to break the perception of Islam that has been established in the West in recent years, said: "I had no problem with my shirt at the Olympics".
Here athletes are fighting for their talents.
I get positive messages from many countries in the Islamic world through social media.
Women in particular say, 'You're a source of encouragement, we're proud of you.'
I opened a door for women with headscarves".
"They're understanding when I tell them I'm wearing this dress because of my religion", said Elghobashy, a 20-year-old Egyptian who claims that foreign athletes sometimes come to him and ask him why he's wearing a closed dress.
Kazakhstan Balandin wrote history
One of the greatest surprises in the history of swimming took place yesterday morning with the victory of Kazakh Dmitry Balandin against the Soviet Union.
In the 200-meter butterfly, which is a favorite of U.S. swimmers, Balandin won in 2 minutes, 7 seconds and 46 seconds.
Balandin, who won the first swimming medal in Kazakhstan's history, followed with a 2:07.53 mark by Josh Prenot of the USA, and a 2:07.70 mark by Rus Chupkov.
Sun: Let friendship be the first
Beşiktaş Technical Director Shenol Güneş said the Super Cup match would be very meaningful for the mosque as it coincides with the anniversary of the death of Suleiman Seba.
"I am convinced that in these days when we need friendship, brotherhood more than ever, friendship will be the main focus not only on the field but also in the stands", said the experienced trainer.
FETÖ commander Gülen's property was confiscated
The Adana Republic Prosecutor General's Office for Terrorist-Technical and Organized Crime Investigation filed a lawsuit against 17 suspects in the Adana 2nd Criminal Court, seeking to provide funding to the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization by making illegal changes to the construction plans and increasing the value of immovable property belonging to persons and organizations connected with FETÖ/PDY.
In the case in which the number 1 accused, Fethullah Gülen, was tried for 'Attempting to Remove the Constitutional Order from the Middle', the court board issued an arrest warrant for the suspects, Omer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who escaped with Gülen.
But the fugitive who has not been arrested and has not yet appeared in court has decided to conduct a court-ordered escape for the four defendants.
The Adana 2nd Criminal Court has ordered the seizure of all property of Fetullah Gülen, Omar Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in a foreign country and therefore could not reach them, in order to ensure that the case against them remains unresolved.
The court's decision also froze the assets, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all types of rights and receivables, valuables, shares in the company, and bank accounts of the fugitive.
Husayn Gülerin: The collapse of Gülen is due to the collapse of 3 feet
Hussein Gü Gülerin, who commented on FETO's coup attempt, made striking remarks.
The lines from the explanations of Hussein Gülerin are as follows:
I've been thinking about this for the last five or six months, in my posts, that they can strike, but they can't do it in a chain of command.
I didn't know two things, one was that it was so widespread and profound, like the eight-year commanding officer of the General Command of the Gendarmerie and the younger brother of the President.
Mr. President, the person who struggles the most is the one who knows how careful he is when choosing his cubs, but the most important thing about them is unprecedented secrecy.
They're very hypocritical.
One of the most important proofs of the phrase "This is not what a retired minister like FETÖ can do" is that it is such a deep compass.
He's definitely getting support from the CIA.
The CIA, this guy got it too early.
Mahmut Ovür said in 2014 that in 1971 they met with Fatullah Gülen in Fuat Oriental in the home of Vehbi Koch.
He says the most interested people of that time were those who were most closely connected to the CIA.
The United States paid our military personnel, and then a man came out and said, "I don't remember".
When do we learn that, in 2014.
After this letter from Mr. Mahmut, there was no statement denying it.
For example, Justice Orphan, he got caught, didn't he?
He's wondering who that is.
The man went to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the strike, returned two days ago.
The fair orphan has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all this together, you need to investigate, which of the fugitives went to the United States under an excuse since March 1999, when all of them went to the United States.
It'll be obvious they went to Pennsylvania for some reason.
But the CIA's real connections can be traced back to this, especially from people who needed to be upgraded from the security ranks, many people who were sent to the United States safely.
It's in WikiLeaks, and Gülen is setting up a society that partners with the CIA.
15 years ago, there was a study to officially show that he had ties to the CIA.
Fuat Avni is an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania, I told you two years ago.
The man who works for the Prime Minister works for Fuat Avni.
But the bad news is, this information has fallen to the CIA just like it did to Pennsylvania.
The fall of Gülen was due to the collapse of three legs, one of which we call the base, which formed a circle of friends, some who were deeply hypnotized, even this coup attempt they say is still Erdogan's film.
I meant three feet, a base support.
The theft of questions, theft, the defeat of the slave rights, it shook this base of support.
The other two legs: political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that will break the political support is the documentation that the tapes of the Baikal and MHP executives were filmed by FETO.
After July 15, Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu also uses "FETÖ", he opened everyone's eyes.
She's a funny little trickster who says, "I'm not doing it, she's doing it around me".
He says to me, "Oh, Mr. Hussein, these girls are demanding very different dreams, they send me, I've already forbidden it, because it's not right to act with dreams".
There was a recording, and the speaker was Barbaros Kocakurt: "Teacher, my friends have a dream, our Prophet double the tweets.
One police officer was killed in Nusaybin
According to the information, the armoured vehicle of the police stationed in the neighborhood of Selahaddin Ayubi was shot by terrorists with long-armed weapons.
The first fire killed a policeman, wounded a police officer.
The police response resulted in two terrorists being disabled.
The injured officer was taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
Operations are underway in the area.
The strike stopped the broadcast
Private TVs, which played a key role in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15, continued to broadcast thanks to a technical staff who heroically resisted the coup in Turkestan.
This is the hero Asim Akkaya...
Akkaya, who said that they entered the psychology of resistance with the instruction to cut the broadcast during the reading of the announcement on TRT, said: "I risked everything thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire that started from the helicopter".
They put a gun to my head and asked me to cut off the broadcast.
I just turned off the local TVs.
Then I told them to get out of the building by telling them we had to go to the dish antennas.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna room.
"I cut some wires here again, but I didn't touch the literature", he said.
When the strikers failed to stop the broadcast in Turkestan, Skywalk brought in the experts of TV.
These terrorists were caught by police arriving three minutes ago.
When the attackers returned to the building, Akkaya told them about an hour later that he had heard the TV broadcast continue, and that he was dying at that moment.
I took over the night shift at 8:00.
He gave us that.
A friend of mine was a security guard for the e-government and electrical system.
We were meeting for tea around 9:00 p.m. when helicopters flew over us.
There were a few other aircraft flying quietly from below the helicopter again.
We saw your lights.
It was probably unmanned aerial vehicles that could take pictures.
They were flying in front of the helicopters.
I've been there for 11 years, and it's the first time I've ever seen a flight this close, so I've called the regulation.
Then a movement began.
We found out on the news that the bridge was closed.
At that time, our general manager instructed the security guards who were not at the time to come to the building.
We found out that all the packages on TRT had fallen off.
TRT broadcasts were cut for five minutes.
I called TRT's main controller, but I couldn't reach him.
Our control station said that TRT broadcasts have returned and the announcement has begun to be read.
Our Deputy Director General Halil Yeşilçimen requested the immediate cutting of TRT broadcasts on the instructions of the general director.
TRT 3 broadcasts broadcast over a wide area, so we started working to cut it.
We just heard Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım say there's an uprising.
Our director's order to stop the TRT has put us in a little resistance psychology.
We cut off the TRT, and then we heard a helicopter sound.
We went out, the helicopter went down the stairs, they shot everywhere, everyone was scattered.
We're hiding in a building in the back.
There were 12 of us.
When we got back, the soldiers who were getting off the helicopter got in.
Some of our friends were captured by soldiers.
We're here to keep them from leaving.
I saw them catch our deputy general manager and kneel down.
The soldiers were talking to each other.
Someone said, "Let's shoot one of them, they'll be scared".
Then they let us all in.
"I will not ask again", he shouted.
And when we heard the "shoot somebody" speech, we thought, "We don't know the country, but we got an instruction to turn off the TRT".
So there's a resistance.
I felt like I was giving up my life.
I said, "Me".
I got up at that moment, not knowing what to do.
All I could think about at the time was that my friends in the regiment were shot from the helicopter.
I thought 10-15 of my friends were martyrs in the order, and I felt relieved when I thought, 'They're going to kill us too, eventually.'
The commander in charge said, 'You're going to cut all the broadcasts except for TRT.'
We have a system part that monitors local channels when they're launched to satellite.
We're broadcasting 80 of the 200 local channels from the talk show.
I thought of this room.
They had no national broadcasts.
If I cut these and say they're all cut, at least until then, or support comes, or help comes from outside.
Or I said, "Go wherever you want".
We finally agreed we couldn't get out.
I said, 'I'm going to cut it.'
I cut off the antenna output of one of the local channel packets.
I cut the power button to the monitors where we can watch national channels.
So there's no sign on all the screens.
I told him I had to go to the antenna so he could shut it down completely.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, and one of the soldiers said, "Stay there".
He's got the gun on my forehead.
'You're going to cut them all off except for TRT, and there won't be any left, and I'm going to shoot one of you eventually, and that's you.'
And I said, "You'll see when you go, it'll all be frozen", and I said nothing else.
We walked into the station, and I cut off the local broadcasts.
We're on the other antenna.
I had a system that would match about 20 national channels.
When he cut off the local channels, about 20 monitors were gone.
My Lord helped us, so that we were not constrained, and He endued their eyes.
They believed the answers we gave them.
They couldn't.
That's relieved us.
When they got off the antenna, they asked where the trafo was.
I said, 'I don't know, I'm a TV broadcaster,' and he said, 'Do you have an electrician?'
I said, 'There's no electric after dinner, and if there's a breakdown, the team will come.'
Actually, there was an electrician back then.
I thought I didn't cut off the Cypriot broadcast.
I was thinking of cutting them off to keep the soldiers down.
They're a little relieved they thought the broadcasts were off.
They couldn't think of looking at the media.
The group's on hold now.
About an hour later, they turned on the TV in the waiting room and saw A News.
He's in there, soldier.
'My commander didn't cut off the A News broadcast,' he said.
We've been in front of the commander.
He said, 'Get up.'
I got up.
At that moment, a soldier said, 'We still have ongoing literature.'
'There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus,' he said.
I said, 'They're broadcasting over Cyprus, we can't do anything to them.'
"Then he said, 'After we had written to someone, he got us all up and walked.'
The strikers fled Turkssat in a van.
I saw the photos of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and watered me being executed in that van seat.
They shot him three times in the forehead and cheeks.
My friends confirmed that he was the same soldier.
They called that soldier "son" with us.
Probably a soldier who did.
They may have executed him to get rid of him.
Asim Akkaya said that the first police team came to Turkssat from Gölbaşı.
When the police team found out there were helicopters around, security was scanning, they went back to the county to get ammunition.
They came back after 40 minutes.
When the police arrived, they didn't see anyone in Turkestan's foreign policy.
Akkaya, who told that after only 3-4 minutes of police contact, so-called experts sent from the Samanyolu TV came to the building, said, "They called the police teams from inside, they said we are Turksat personnel, we need to get in urgently".
"When the police asked for their identity, the four of them suddenly clutched their phones and reported 'we were caught' inside", he said.
The spirit of the mountain after defeat
The AK Party will send a large delegation of businessmen, artists, athletes and conquest leaders to Diyarbakir, Van and Mardin in early September to establish "heart bridges" with the citizens of the region.
AK Party is preparing to move the "Defeat spirit" of democracy after the bloody coup attempt of the FETÖ/PDY junta to Diyarbakir.
The provincial governors of CHP and MHP will also be invited to the relief campaign to be held in the Eastern and Southeastern Anatolian regions before the holiday.
The AK Party, which will deliver the message to the people of the region "The state and the people are with you", will provide assistance to poor families and those in need.
The Gönül Bridge project, which was first implemented in Ramadan, was discussed at the last meeting of the AK Party's MYK.
The meeting, which evaluated the positive results of the project for the victims of terrorism, families in need, especially young people and children, decided to continue the Gönül Bridge on the Day of Sacrifice.
The work was started under the chairmanship of Deputy President, Civil Society and Public Relations President Mehmet Muezinoğlu.
Accordingly, 12 provinces in the east and southeast will be assembled in Diyarbakir, Mardin and Van.
Meetings will be held in these three counties, which are now officially recognized as centers, before the holiday.
Businessmen, artists, athletes and community leaders will also participate in the activities.
These meetings will discuss the organization of aid and work.
On the occasion of the holiday of sacrifice, the committees of famous people will deliver their aid to the citizens themselves.
The children and young people will be paid holiday expenses, and the school needs will be met as after-hours schools are opened.
The meat of the victim will be distributed to those in need.
The atmosphere of national unity between the AK Party, CHP and MHP after July 15 against the coup will also be reflected in this project.
The 12 CHP and MHP provincial presidents will also be invited to the organizations.
The aid will be coordinated by three parties.
The HDP is not expected to be invited to the events as in the defeat.
The father-in-law of the "Justice Orphan" spoke
The mother-in-law of FETO's Justice Orphan, who was identified as the number one suspect in the July 15 coup attempt, was arrested and taken to court along with her father-in-law.
Father-in-law Cevat Yildirim and father-in-law Hatice Yildirim were released under the terms of judicial review and a ban on leaving the country.
Speaking at the courthouse, Cevat Yildirim called on his son-in-law to surrender and said: "I am with the state".
God damn the beaters.
I know, I didn't really know the Fair Orphan I'd known for 18 years.
I don't have a son-in-law who's a fair orphan.
I want him caught just a minute.
He can't live in Turkey or in the world.
Come, trust the Turkish justice.
If he's wrong, he's going to get punished.
He's been bothering us by running.
It's a pity for the police, it's a pity for the state.
The police have been doing nothing else for 20-25 days.
Yıldırım, who said he did not want Turkey to return to Syria, said: "We need to work, not a coup".
We don't want Turkey to go and be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
He has a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"What's the deal with our coup?" he said.
On July 19, at around 03.00 hours, the orphan was missing after leaving his car with the 'SIR' sign in the garage of his father-in-law's house in Akyazi.

He saw a compass in Ergenekon, FETO killed him
Ankara Prosecutor General's Office is investigating the role of FETO in the mysterious death of Special Operations Directorate Head Behçet Oktay, whose file was closed in 2009 as "Suicide".
Ramazan Akyürek, former head of the Security Intelligence Department who had been in the same lounge with Oktay and who had been falsely accused of being a suspect in Hezbollah terrorist organization six days before his death, is the prime suspect in the investigation.
It is suggested that some of the ammunition seized in the Ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried by the security FETÖ team from the Special Operations Department, which was killed because Oktay found out.
The death of Behçet Oktay, then head of the Special Operations Department, who was shot in the head on 25 February 2009 in Ankara, was described as "suicide".
But there were many question marks in the case.
Two years later, as a result of legal battles and evidence provided by his family and family lawyers, a murder investigation was opened.
Oktay, the left-hander, was reportedly carrying the gun in his right hand.
He also had fractures to his ribs and bruises to his body.
The case against the murder was opened in May 2012.
Only Khalid Cutcher, who was with him when he died and found a bullet print in his hand, was tried in the murder case.
The jury eventually acquitted him.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor saying he was involved in Oktay's death, was sentenced to six months in prison for "acquiring a crime and misleading the judicial authorities".
Those who ask questions
Meanwhile, prosecutor Hussain Yalçın, who called the incident "suicide", retired and promoted Mustafa to the Düzgün Court, which conducted the murder investigation.
Oktay's family wants to investigate autopsy attorney Nihat Yıldırım along with these prosecutors.
Behçet Oktay's sister Shule Oktay and brother Nezih Oktay and family lawyers made several demands during the trial.
The family said it was not possible for Khalil Kesci to kill the specialised Oktay alone, and asked for an expansion of the investigation.
The family said the case was covered up and demanded that prosecutors Hussain Yalçin and Mustafa Düzgün and Behçet Oktay, security officers who wanted to close the case as suicide, be identified and tried.
While all the family's demands were denied, it turned out that Oktay was falsely named "Abdurrahman True" for being a member of the Hezbollah terrorist organization six days before his death.
It was determined that the person who did the hearing was the then head of the Security Intelligence Department, Ramazan Akyürek.
The Ankara Prosecutor General's Office, which reviewed the Behçet Oktay case, began investigating the FETÖ finger in the murder.
The case against Oktay's illegal rest will begin on September 19.
The one who has a feather in your back
The family of Oktay, whom SABAH met, is hopeful about the current investigation.
Family members say the FETÖ finger was concealed during the previous indictment investigation and trial.
Sister Shule Oktay said, "This murder is actually showing".
We didn't pick it up.
Before my brother was killed, he said, 'They're gonna eat me.'
I said "Who".
Then he pointed FETÖ at me.
I thought he was gonna be fired.
I never thought of death.
There's FETO behind this, of course.
"The government was in their hands", he said.
The martyr called the young man's family, joined in his prayer
After speaking to the citizens in the Presidential Gardens, during the last evening of the presidential guard, which was interrupted by the security of democracy, the AK Party Sinop MP Nazım Maviş called the family of university student Omar Jan Açıkgöz.
Father Fahrettin Açıkgöz said that when they were praying for his son at 01:30 at night, the phone came, "Our President also joined in his prayers".
"I told him that our country and his health are important to us".
'Your Health Is Important to Us'
President Erdoğan addressed the citizens in front of the Presidential Mosque the night before.
Erdoğan met with some citizens in Kulliya after his speech that ended in the middle of the night.
Taking the hand of an elderly aunt who was on the security guard for democracy, Tayyip Erdogan spoke to the citizens one by one, took care of the children, and thanked the citizens for their sacrifices.
Erdogan then called for Omar Jan Açıkgöz's father Fahrettin Açıkgöz, who was killed on July 15.
Fahrettin Açıkgöz, the father of 21-year-old Ömer Can, a law student at TOBB University who was shot in front of the Presidential Cemetery, said that President Erdoğan called him at 01.30 pm while he was praying for his son and the martyrs.
I told him that the health of our country and his own is very important to us.
"We were very pleased that our President called and prayed on the phone", she said.

Turkey, which has been fighting relentlessly for more than 40 years to end PKK terrorism, is beginning to face the day when it cannot destroy the leaders of the organization in this struggle.
FETÖ militants, who infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions, worked to tie Turkey's hand in hand on all sides.
At the moment, serious suspicions and evidence have emerged that FETO was behind critical events such as the Hrant Dink Murder, Uludere, the downing of a Russian plane.
The story of the betrayal of the great
During the July 15 coup attempt, it was revealed that the record of FETÖ Brigadier General Gökhan Shahin Sönmezateş, who led the raid and assassination operation on President Tayyip Erdogan's hotel in Marmaris, was very puffy.
Earlier, it was reported that Sönmezateş reported airstrikes against the PKK to terrorists while the planes were flying.
Investigations by intelligence agencies also revealed that Gökhan Sönmezateş's record was bloated.
The terrorists have been killed
In addition to leaking intelligence to the PKK, Turkish warplanes have not hit targets.
The intelligence provided by the MIT in Kandil about the leadership of the PKK, allegedly prevented the targeting by being misled by Gökhan Sönmezateş.
The change of coordinates also allowed the PKK to be rescued by the fighter jets that were flying to destroy the leadership staff, the leaders of the terrorist organization that hit the side of the targets.
The intelligence investigation revealed that Sönmezateş played a key role in both diverting targets and fleeing PKK terrorists without F-16s.
Opening the file of 37,000 officers
Following the coup attempt of FETO members, the reorganization process was initiated in the TSK and the Ministry of National Defense.
Especially when it was discovered that the entrance questions to military high schools were stolen by FETO, and that military students who were not members of the organization were discouraged from school, a thorough cleaning process was started.
With the latest exports, about 37,000 officers remain, while the cleanup for the generals and admirals will be carried out for these officers.
For this, promotion will be frozen, especially for personnel ranging from lieutenant to colonel.
A full investigation will be completed before you get promoted.
The files of 37,000 officers have begun to be opened one by one.
A study of 40 wounded men will reveal FETO soldiers.
Officers who are not affiliated with FETO will continue their duties.
The fight will continue until the last FETO is cleared from the army, while the promotion of officers will only come up after the investigation.
The investigation is being conducted jointly by the MIT, the Security Intelligence and the State Supervisory Board.
The investigation examines the officers who were registered, whether civilian or military, their rank, promotion, place of duty, and commanders.
And even by the rules, they'll be investigated by a 40-year-old study.
All measures will be taken to ensure that officers with no connection to FETÖ are not adversely affected by the process.
If the slightest suspicion is found, that officer will be brought to justice immediately.
Any contact with FETÖ, anyone with information and documents about FETÖ will be immediately cut off from the military.
While all these promotions are frozen, the investigation will be deepened.
The necessary measures will be taken to ensure that there are no vacancies in the post-export staff.
Those who are expelled from the FETÖ compass and forced retired from the TSK can return to their jobs with the same privileges as their counterparts and counterparts after they pass the security investigation if they want.

Pehlivanoğlu: Turkish was poisoned by FETO
Retired Chief Commissioner Tahsin Pehlivanoğlu, the founder and first general president of the MHP, Alparslan Turkesh, suggested that Turkesh was poisoned and killed by a family member in cooperation with FETÖ.
Pehlivanoğlu, who was with Turkesh from 1977 until his death in 1997, said: "I never told anyone until today, but I was able to talk after watching the soldier's image of Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu falling from the helicopter and seeing that the same soldier was in the coup d'état that was sent to kill our President".
Here's what the Turkish guard said:
We went to Germany in 1997.
We had the head checked out three days before he arrived.
"You look like an 18-year-old".
"You're all right", he said.
This doctor died of a heart attack a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3.
My other brother went to Amasya.
They called me back and they went to a destination at the Ankara Hilton.
After leaving the target, the Turkish driver says to Alparslan, "Open the rear window".
He wouldn't open a window in life.
When you open the window, it sounds like a hiccup.
First they did a heart massage at Chankaia Medical Center, electro, but it was over.
We took him to Mr. Medical Center together, but he was out of business.
I think someone from the family poisoned him in Amasya.
Turkesh was not autopsied.
His ex-wife Seval Turkesh, who must have heard my discomfort and my remarks, went out and made defensive statements like "Turkish was killed".
Man makes a grave, he makes a grave open.
They said he had a heart attack.
Turkesh's grave must be reopened.
Has Alparslan Turkesh been killed?

He prayed a martyrdom without knowing the impact.
The family of Chetin Jan, 38, who was martyred on the Bogaziçi Bridge on the night of July 15, is protecting his methane.
His wife Fatma Jan said that while she was not yet aware of the coup attempt that night, she learned the "Martyrdom prayer in the month of Shaval" in a conversation, and then she prayed martyrdom at home, advising her to do the same.
After the prayer, Fatma Jan, who reported watching the news on television and learning of the coup attempt, said:
We got ready and went out together.
When we went to the bridge, there were people waiting.
As soon as we entered the bridge, the tank fired two shots at us.
We bought the trench, then when the tank went, we continued walking.
There was a big bus stop on the bridge.
It was so crowded.
We stood there for a while, waited.
We thought about what to do when we couldn't move forward.
The gang wanted us to cross the sideline.
I guess he was a sniper when he crossed the sideline, we were a clear target, and he was shot there.
And he prayed four hours after that, and he was martyred.
He didn't know about the strike.
The wisdom of God...
God gives, God takes.
My wife said before, "If I die, plant a fruit tree in my grave".
I made that wish come true by planting an eric tree at the top of his grave.
Fatma Jean also thanked President Erdoğan for visiting them and said, "God bless him".

The sky will be the scene of meteor showers
TÜBİTAK National Observatory Researcher and faculty member of the Department of Astronomy and Space Sciences of Istanbul University, Doç. Dr. Hasan Esenoğlu, told AA in a statement that Perseid will reach its peak on Friday, August 12, the night that connects to Saturday, August 13.
Esenoğlu said that thousands of fragments of the comet "Swift-Tuttle" were separated by sunlight and gravity to form the Perseid meteor shower, which would in effect become a natural visual storm.
Esenoğlu said the Perseid meteorite was first discovered in 1862, and since the 1990s it has been seen again around the world.
Esenoğlu said that the Perseid meteor shower can be observed in July and August, "We need to watch such a visual rainfall from space, we need to be interested".
It's a natural visual event, after all.
"It will help us to get to know the environment better", he said.
They'll shine red when it's cold, white when it's hot.
Esenoğlu noted that some of the fragments that burst during the meteor shower would fall to the ground in the size of a flashlight, and he continued:
Perseid temperatures can reach up to 2,000 degrees.
Because of the warming and friction in the atmosphere, the Perseids produce red light when it's cold and white when it's hot.
You can contribute to science by writing down how many galaxies are seen on the International Organization for Astronomy's website.
This data is valuable because it's collected from all over the world.
It 'll be on all night .
Recalling that the meteor shower is moving at a speed of about 60 kilometers per second, Esenoğlu said that this visual event in the sky can be well observed throughout the night from low-light areas in the northeast.
Esenoğlu reported that more than 100 meteor showers occurred per year, and after the Perseid meteor shower, the Geminid meteor shower on December 4-17, recorded a natural event worth watching.
Erdoğan, former football player with little education
What broke this balance was a victorious alliance between the populist Islamists led by the less educated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a largely religious entrepreneur, Fetullah Gülen, a highly educated follower of the higher education establishment that established more than a thousand schools, dozens of universities and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent.
The above is a translation of an article in Foreign Policy last week.
These and similar articles, in which Erdoğan, a university graduate, is described as a low-educated and former football player; Gulen, a graduate of primary school, is described as a horizon wide entrepreneur, and Gulen's disciples openly praise him, are frequently featured in the Western press.
Then, on the other hand, they try to explain why America and/or the West are increasingly opposed in Turkey, with sentences beginning with 'Because Erdogan...'
It is possible to imagine that analysts who view the Western opposition in Turkey as a neutral situation that emerged during the Erdogan era are unaware of Turkey's history.
In fact, statistics show that the first decade of the Erdogan era can be read as a period when Western opposition in Turkey decreased or remained average.
Because in that decade, it had a synchronized relationship with the European Union and the United States.
Erdogan's one-minute criticism of Israel, the EU's failure to put forth a clear policy on the outbreak of civil war in Syria as a result of the massacres by the Assad regime, and the failure to leave Turkey alone in the refugee crisis, the "Erdoğan is not our conversation" aggressive stance of some figures such as President Schulz of the European Parliament, the opening of a libel competition against Erdogan in Britain and the then Mayor of London, the current Foreign Minister of Turkey, a poem that has generated such disgust that you cannot imagine, the live repair of bombs by the PKK's members who entered the country from Syria, the presence of the PKK in Syria and the presence of the PKK in Europe, and the presence of the PKK in the country, and the presence of the special forces of the United States and the SPA in the fight against the YPG, the presence of special forces and the presence of the DPRK in the country, the presence of the support of our citizens in Syria and the presence of the YPG in the European armed forces, the presence of the special forces of the United States and the DPRK, and the lack of the ability to reduce the number of U.S.
Let's say that we lose 247 people in a bloody coup, and we forget that no support for democracy has come from our so-called allies, the EU and the US, until the coup is proven to be a failure, that they expect peace and stability in Turkey to be built in Kerry's first speech on the issue, that they have made no emphasis on democracy and elected government.
How can we forget that many leaders from all over the world, including Turkey, have taken part in a protest march in Paris over the killing of 11 Charlie Hebdo employees, but that no Western president has come to Turkey from any 'allied' country, even though a month has passed since the coup attempt that killed 247 tanks resisting democracy?
What about the presidents who come to the refugee issue a few times a year or the high-level representatives who send low-level representatives?
How are we going to assess whether all EU and US ambassadors have visited the bombed Grand National Assembly of Turkey on a solidarity visit because the window of the newspaper Friyet was broken?
If we remember that during the first two weeks of the coup in Egypt, the EU shake hands with the coup leader Sisi by sending high-level representatives, and Kerry praised the coup regime during his post-coup visit, saying that 'democracy is being rebuilt', is it not unusual for Western countries who refuse to support Turkey in its resistance to democracy to express their genuine concern about Turkish democracy at every opportunity?
Even Gulen, who is seen by 95% of the population as responsible for the coup, being allowed to live freely in the United States is enough to upset the Turkish people.
And if you add to that the background I've listed above, I think it's clear that the rising West-American antagonism is something that can't be explained with Erdogan alone.
And Erdogan hasn't even said he thinks the US has an influence on the coup...
So we never thought it was a fluke.
Do you think the traveling intellectuals who despise their own people, who say "The Ark is a waste", who disdain the voters who don't think like them as "ignorant, scratching their guts", can still play the same wire after the night of July 15?
After seeing how this people has gained control of the state and democracy, did they ask, "Where did we go wrong?"
But there are so many questions to be answered?
How officers who served in various stages until yesterday and were given the right to use state arms suddenly accepted the status of "Hain" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We need to see how a distorted world we live in and how people's obsessions are leading people to conduct that is misguided.
When it comes to the brainwashed coup attempt...
Did the participants have a perspective beyond comparing Turkish cities to Syrian cities?
Why would an officer bomb his country's parliament?
We should not have been led into the illusion of expecting reasonable behavior from brains that are watered with fetal beds.
But let's just say it's not just FETO that's responsible for everything.
The cadres who portray politics as a profession of strife, hatred and hatred have also made the necessary contributions to the tragedy.
The "Light" are not only self-proclaimed, but they have convinced the public that all kinds of irregular behavior and even indecency are natural.
We've finally seen how those who hate their own people are given guns and firing at this crowd.
The way of democracy, the way we know
I'm saying something very simple: on the evening of July 15th, the FETO people's army in Turkey gave 250 martyrs to gunmen, harams, sergeants and built more than saved democracy.
But there are three periods behind July 15th: 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and beyond.
There are three changes that have been made in these three periods: economic, social, and political.
Social change has produced two major events: the migration from rural areas to metropolitan areas and the relocation of these migrants to the centre after being kept in the suburbs for a very long time.
I said Wednesday that this transport was by subway.
I also stressed that the metro is the most important factor in social change.
The second major change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The contribution of roads and bridges to modernisation is easier to understand.
The road is changing, the economic and social structure is changing.
And we've changed the political structure so much.
I've identified this date in Istanbul with the bridges that were thrown over the Strait since I passed.
Ironman built the Bridge of the Gorge.
This was the height of the peasant movement after 1950.
Özal continued to move in the same direction with the second bridge, which we now rename the 15 July Martyrs Bridge.
Even their routes show the relationship between the environment and the center.
And it's a sign of how social change is taking place.
Demirel and Özal's goal was to melt the large crowds in the center.
It was to embrace the ideology of the center.
The AK Party hasn't built the third bridge in years.
Because the migration was going at full speed.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
A somewhat closed system was created in those areas.
Local AK Party governments gave people food, jobs, social status, and they voted for the AK Party.
So the masses were asked to acquire political consciousness around the centre, not to melt in the centre, and then come to the centre 'as themselves'.
This formation was related to the ongoing head-to-head discussions (1992-2002) before the AK Party.
These debates have convinced the masses that conservative, moderate and rural people need to stand side by side rather than integrate with the center.
The AK Party, after 2002, has politicized the masses, enlisted them, matured them.
After all, now notice, the construction of the Third Bridge coincided with the democratic struggle of July 15.
So history and sociology are overlapping.
Let me add another dimension: the AK Party's move, which I mentioned, is not limited to Istanbul bridges.
What's even more interesting is that the AK Party is now integrating the suburbs with the central cities.
And that's being done through two bridges.
One, the Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, the 1915 Bridge at Chanakkale.
Add the routes to that.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Thrace by another route.
You know what that means, Imir will be a different city from now on.
Let's say that the AK Party will now take Izmir from the 'outside' where it can't get it from the inside.
Now Bursa, now Canakkale, now Thracian cities will become different human and social geographies.
That's it!
The martyrs of July 15 are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie and the cheerful sport in Fenerbahçe
Fenerbahçe continued the preparations for the Grasshoppers match with his morning practice.
The training, which started at 10.00 hours under the direction of Vitor Pereira, technical director at Can Bartu facilities, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of core training in the gym, the players took to the field to run and warm up with 5 to 2 balls and passing exercises.
The training was completed with a double-cross match in the narrow field.
Fenerbahçe will continue its preparations with training this evening.
The man who complained about St. Lightning to Gulen...
There are new developments regarding Operation Shike in Fenerbahçe.
Journalist Hussein Gülerin, who participated in a CNN Turk program and explained that the operation was carried out by FETÖ, "a name from the sports world brought to Fethullah Gülen the words of Aziz Yıldırım about himself".
"One day, on the plane, this person said, 'What are you doing with Fethullah Gülen?'
When this person told Gülen these words, Fethullah Gülen put them on Aziz Yıldırım.
Why did he put it on St. Lightning?
The president of the club, which has the most supporters in Turkey, thinks he can hurt himself in this way.
He used the phrase "the complaint was to clear Aziz Yıldırım".
A statement followed from Faik Işık, a prominent lawyer in the Shike case.
The report was published in the newspaper Yışık Habertürk and identified the person who complained to FETÖ commander Fethullah Gülen.
Here are the words of Faik Lishik:
St. Elder is telling Ishaan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gülen.
I was on a private plane coming from Azerbaijan.
Aziz Bey is a man of humor, and when he criticizes someone, he also uses profound sentences.
Those subversive sentences might be a little wingy.
Some may react to those sentences.
These sentences are being grown somewhere.
Hawl, hammet, it's not tolerated that so many businessmen go there as if they were going to Hajj, Umre.
They're very critical of what they say is business.
That's not the only problem, of course.
And, by the way, a football team tries.
Direct contacts from some of the players and managers of Galatasaray Club and Hakan Shukur...
Muharrem Master: The subject of fashion is different
Trabzonspor president Muharrem Usta extended a friendly hand to Fenerbahçe.
He said that the Turkish issue is the issue of all clubs, and that "we are on this country's side with 79 million".
We need to be healthy.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FETO, if there's been an injustice, I'll stand behind Fenerbahçe.
"But the issue of the chic between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is different", he said.
Prices for the sacrifice have been announced
"Together, we have set the price of a kilogram of live sacrificial grain at 18 pounds", Karabulut said.
"We have determined the price of the duck at 17 pounds per kilogram of live animals and the price of the second-class cow at 15 pounds per kilogram of live animals", he said.
Noting that animals that will not be sacrificed were also offered for sale last year, Karabulut said what citizens should be careful about when they receive sacrifices:
In animals, the ear canal should be especially carefully monitored.
It's also important that the animal is healthy.
That's why our citizens can check the vaccines in the animal's passport while they're taking the victim.
And the victim must have been alive and well, and he must have dropped his feathers on her.
And you should have no signs of slime or snoring on your face.
In recent years, we've seen non-victim animals being offered for sale and sold.
A victim's animal has to be two years old.
We can tell by looking at the animal's teeth.
The teeth of an animal over two years old, which we call "the cage", have come out.
But the younger animals don't have these teeth.
The animal may appear large, but the toothed lid may not have emerged.
The front teeth are already larger than the others.
Rize Airport to be launched
Rize Airport will be the second airport to be built in Turkey with sea-going oil.
Rize Airport will be built on a 266-hectare site between the village of Yeşilköy in the market district and the site of the Girl Tower, 26 to 32 meters from the coast.
Due to the high depth of construction of Rize airport, about 3 times more filling materials will be used than used at Army-Giresun Airport.
The project will include a runway with a runway 45 meters wide and 3,000 meters long, with a capacity of 36 aircraft per hour.
Rize Airport, which will generally serve passenger and cargo aircraft, is also expected to serve aircraft with a composition class D, turbulence class heavy, takeoff weight of more than 150,000 kilograms.
The Rize Airport project, which will be commissioned by the Directorate General of Underground Investments of the Ministry of Transportation Maritime and Communications on September 8, will initially be built with sea lanes, runways, aprons, taxis, roads, safety wire, ledges, PAT fields and environmental lighting.
This is going to cost 600 million lire.
After the infrastructure works, the construction works will be carried out, including the terminal buildings, with the cost of 150 million liras.
The construction of Rize Airport will be completed in 2 years and 9 months.
8 cents on the engine
Fuel distribution companies have increased their engine's litre by an average of eight cents, effective midnight.
According to the Petrol Products Employers' Union (PYIS), the average price increase for the litre of the engine will be 8 cents from August 13, 2016.
Accordingly, the price of an average litre engine in Ankara will rise to 3.76 litres.
The price of the engine will rise from an average of 3.63 liras to 3.71 liras in Istanbul, and an average of 3.66 liras to 3.74 liras in Izmir.
Prices set by distribution companies can vary slightly between companies and cities due to competition and competition.
Fuel distribution companies last week raised their engine price by 4 cents a liter on Friday.
Here are the Galatasaray football players in Gulen's conversation.
It turned out that Galatasaray and national football players who had made their mark on Turkish football were included in the conversation of FETÖ head Fetullah Gülen in 1996.
The video, which was shot in 1996, clearly shows Hakan Ünsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, Ismail Demiriz, Uğur Tütüneker and Yusuf Tepekule among the footballers who listened to the conversation of Fetullah Gülen.
In this conversation, Gülen used the phrase "We scored 4 goals and won".
Said Alpsoy, former football imam of FETÖ, recently told the newspaper SABAH: "When Turkey became world third in 2002, the team was awarded a bonus".
Emre, Okan, Hakan Shukur, Hakan Ünsal and Arif collected money from these bonuses.
The money collected was $250,000 or $500,000.
Arif Erdem took this money to Pennsylvania.
"Gulen later told Arif that he was in trouble".
The national football team has joined Gulen's conversation!
Emel Dereli said goodbye to Rio

The practice, which also includes traffic control, is supported by police helicopters from the air.
It's been reported that the application will last until late.
Stop the social media coup propaganda!
According to the information, the teams of the Directorate of Cybercrime Management of the Directorate of Security of Isparta have started work on the information that Gökhan Okçu propagandised the coup attempt of FETÖ on social media and insulted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In the investigation, the teams that identified Gökhan Arcu as praising the coup attempt of FETÖ and the coupers, sharing insults to the coup opponents and President Erdoğan, arrested the suspect with the operation they organized.
Archer, who was taken to court after his security clearance, was arrested.
The deputy governor and the skipper were arrested.

The suspects Ertekin and Bashhan were taken to safety.
Robert from Amsterdam has made some very striking statements about FETÖ!
Robert Amsterdam, an official at the law firm Amsterdam&Partners, which is legally investigating the international illegal activities of the FETÖ, wrote an article for the US magazine Forbes, sharing information about how the FETÖ is organized.
Noting that FETÖ head Fetullah Gülen runs the organization from his Pennsylvania headquarters, Amsterdam said that "when you look closely at how Gülen operates some 150 charter schools in the United States, it is clear that the organization has a hidden advanced organizational capability underground".
Amsterdam said that seven months ago Turkey had commissioned it to investigate Gülen-related companies and schools, stressing that what it had found so far was "shocking".
Amsterdam expressed the following views in its article:
According to the information provided by the detectives, the Gülen Organization has a strict hierarchy of instructions.
These instructions are usually delivered at face-to-face meetings between Gülen and Poconos.
There's a management group of seven people on the hill.
This group is forwarding instructions to the advisory committee.
The instructions are sent to the regional imams, the country's imams, the regional imams within the country, the provincial imams, the regional imams within the provinces, the imams of the neighborhood, the imams of the student houses (light houses) and the students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats, and officers work at varying levels depending on their positions and their support within the organization.
Amsterdam, which claims to have 55,000 jobs worldwide and the largest network of contract schools in the United States, reported that millions of dollars are given to these schools each year from taxes paid by American employees.
Amsterdam wrote that most of this money was directed to the members of the organization and transferred to "selected" companies.
Amsterdam explained this operation with the following examples:
Magnolia, a California-based school, was caught paying $700,000 in annual service contracts to a company affiliated with Gülen and sharing the same office.
Amsterdam, for example, showed the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam also noted that the school paid the property owner an additional $3.1 million, and that the audits also revealed that the school and the management of the property owner company were the same people associated with Gülen.
Amsterdam noted that similar situations existed in Harmony schools, which have 46 branches, the largest in the Gülen network, and noted that smaller companies connected to FETÖ were paid with pens such as software licenses, curriculum purchases.
Amsterdam highlighted the enrichment of the FETÖ, saying, "These examples I give show that some $28 million of American taxpayers have been abused".
"And this is the only visible part of what we've found so far", he said.
Noting that nothing had been done to prevent such incidents, Amsterdam recalled that the situation had worsened over time, and the Texas Education Department had begun investigating the irregularities.
Amsterdam stressed that schools seem to be functioning normally, and that many employees were unaware of what kind of corruption was taking place.
Amsterdam, "But these schools actually work like snow machines for the Gulen".
"Gülen then uses the huge sums of money for political donations in order to cover up his illegal activities", he said.
According to a former American teacher who worked in these schools, Amsterdam, who said that some employees of Gülen schools held separate meetings and transferred a certain part of their salaries to the organization, "it is believed that Gülen members of the Turkish Armed Forces also worked in a similar operation".
The instigators have been strengthening their positions over the years.
"But it seems that while the army was operating normally, a parallel force was gathering power behind the scenes", he wrote.
Amsterdam concluded:
The US policymakers have questions about July 15 and 16, and what happens after that, and that's what's expected.
But considering the two allies' diplomatic situation, individual government officials need to be aware that the Gülen operations have seriously violated US law.
22 judges are on the run in Istanbul!

Zechariah's explanation of himself from Sergeant
Asked about the allegations that Zakariya Öz and Adil Ötüz were arrested in Georgia, Sergeant Oshoglu said, "At the moment this information is not accurate".
But there are other reports.
All of this is being evaluated.
We're in close contact with the Georgian authorities.
"Every detail, every information, every report is carefully evaluated", he said.
Asked if he had any doubts about their presence in Georgia, Cavusoglu said: "Zekeriya Öz had fled to Georgia before".
It was detected by the cameras at the customs gate.
He knows he's been to Europe.
We're tracking and examining every piece of information we get, not just about these two, but about the other fugitives.
Wherever they run, we'll follow them".
Asked about his meeting with his Iranian lawyer, Cevad Zarif, Çavuşoğlu said: "Two issues were considered".
There are many issues between Turkey and Iran.
Politics, trade, transportation, energy, the fight against terrorism are our common struggle.
There's regional issues.
Syria, Iraq, Yemen, the Gulf region, first of all.
Turkey and Iran can play an important role in solving the problems in our geography.
We're thinking about a lot of things.
We also consider many issues, such as the territorial integrity of Syria, the integrity of the border and the purge of ISIS and other terrorist organizations in Syria, the creation of an inclusive government.
We had different ideas about Assad.
But we'll keep talking about it as usual.
We're also considering a ceasefire in Geneva.
It's useless to have a common view on many issues unless it's basically a result.
He said, "What matters is getting results".
Asked when Turkish planes would participate in operations in Syria, Sergeant Shvushoglu said, "Our team went to Moscow on this".
"The purpose of these mechanisms is to determine what steps are taken in the fight against Daesh and to prevent any incident from happening, it is necessary to coordinate", he said.
On the question of gas procurement with Iran, Cavusoglu said, "Iran and Turkey are two brothers".
The jury doesn't have to decide, so we can make a deal between us.
I had a little site.
We should be able to make these deals without going to the jury.
He used the phrase "We have demands on gas reductions, prices".
Asked about the date of Gulen's return to America, Sergeant Gushoglu said, "A delegation from America will arrive on the 22nd".
The meetings will be held on August 23-24.
Our Justice Department is preparing the file.
As soon as the file is ready, it will be in line with the US visits.
"We will go to Washington with our Justice Minister and we will both hand over the files and meet", he said.

Iranian Foreign Minister Gazi is in the Assembly!
Sergeant arrived at TBMM with his lawyer Zarif.
Sergeant and Zarif first examined the damage from the Sheref Hall, then went to the Prime Minister's Office to examine the damage.
After his visit Zarif said:
The Turkish people's march to the streets has once again proven that the Turkish people and the people's will are superior to all forces.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has condemned the coup attempt since the early hours of the coup attempt, and has been and always has been on the side of the Turkish people and government.
My visit to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey today is a symbol of our standing with the Turkish people and our standing with Turkish democracy.
13 family caught on the boat
Coast Guard patrols in the Muslim Strait have operated a group of migrants who have been disembarking in the morning to escape to the Greek island of Midilli by boat.
The identification of 13 fugitives was determined to be from the same family.
The head of the family, Seydo Ali Ahmet, said he had taken this route to visit his wife and 11 children with his other son in Germany.
Sayyid Ali Ahmet, who gave the organizers $700 each and said they wanted to go to Greece first and then Germany, said they lived in the Iraqi city of Shanghal and fled to Turkey for fear of being killed by ISIS soldiers because they were Yazidi.

He carried the kids in the trunk so they wouldn 't get dirty
Mustafa O. describes the accident, "We were going to visit with friends".
We got our stuff.
We were hit by a car near the traffic light of the Prophet's visit to Karadut village.
I broke my leg from the impact.
The driver took my friend first and put him in the trunk.
And then he took me and put me in the trunk of his car next to my friend.
My hand was stuck between the trunk door when I put it in the trunk.
I was screaming.
The driver who heard my voice throws the trunk door again.
I got my hand up.
He closed the trunk door again and took us to Narince Village.
"They took us to Kahta State Hospital by ambulance", he said.

Mustafa O, the grandfather of the injured child, said, "I was in Kahta when the accident happened".
I got a call from my grandson and my niece that they had an accident.
I went to Kahta State Hospital right away.
They brought my nephew first.
And 15 minutes later, they brought my grandson.
The Gerger Police Chief is here.
The judge said you're the complainant.
I'm a wreck everywhere.
I said I'm not a complainant.
Then I went to look at the car that hit my niece and nephew.
There's a lot of blood in the trunk.
Then we learned that after hitting the children, he's putting both wounded in the trunk of his car and taking them to the hospital.
My nephew is underneath, and my grandson is overhead, and he's putting it in the trunk.
And the guys say I didn't put it in the trunk.
But the backseats are clean.
"That can't be happening", he said.
"The driver who hit the children brought the wounded here", said Mehmet Kaya, a resident of Narince village.
The kids, the wounded, they pulled out of the trunk.
"He did what even an animal shouldn't have done".
Osman O., the uncle of the wounded, said, "What kind of citizen is this that shot these children?"
It could be an accident, it could be a person who dies in an accident.
But it's a savage thing to take the wounded in the trunk of a car to the hospital.
We're his followers to the end.
One of these kids is punching himself to death.
The other one's in serious condition.
He's bringing the wounded in the trunk of his car from Narince to Kahta.
God forbid.
Don't ever let this wild thing happen again.
Our lungs are burning.
We're gonna be the prosecutors and we're not gonna give up on this.
"We want the person to be punished the hardest", he said.
He built himself an island.
Renowned architect Richart Sowa spent the last eight years of his life building an ecological floating garden.
In this self-sufficient living space he built on using 150,000 plastic bottles, he lives with his ex-model Jodi Bowlin, whom he met on Facebook two years ago.

It's a two-story house, two bathrooms, a hot tub, three showers, a kitchen, and wireless internet.
The island is surrounded by palm trees, mangroves, fruit trees, other edible plants, grass.
The island, connected to the coast by a 30-meter cable, uses this cable to generate electricity, water and internet.
Sowa says, "I'm a vegetarian and I grow a lot of edible vegetables on the island".
I have to go to the nearby little shops to get other food.
"I've got another eight-person shower, made of plastic bottles", he said.

The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Sakarya issued a custodial order against his father Selmet Shukur, who contracted with Hakan Shukur in Sakarya as part of the FETO investigation.
The search was conducted in the homes of Hakan Shukur and his father Selmet Shukur in the United States and Istanbul.
Selmet Shakur was never found despite all the calls.
Police responded to reports that Selmet Shukur was praying Friday at Salko Mosque on Adapazar Sakarya Street.
The teams that went to the mosque waited for Friday prayers.
After the prayer, Selmet Shukur saw the police and raised his hands.
Selmet Shukur was taken to the security department in a police car.
Gökhan Şükür followed his father's team car and went to the security department.
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Sakarya said that Hakan Shukur and his father Selmet Shukur provided financial support to FETÖ.
The Prosecutor's Office, which examined the prosecution's application, ruled that the assets of Hakan Shukur and his father Selmet Shukur, including their land transportation vehicles, bank accounts or other financial institutions, all rights and receivables, valuables, shares in companies, cash registers and other assets were confiscated.

Watch out for this habit of children
Dental school dean Dr. Bilgin Giray said that children can't chew at an early age, so they relax with this reflex by making sucking a necessity.
Dr. Giray, who listed the reasons for the phenomenon of finger sucking in children, said: "Finger sucking is a phenomenon that occurs from birth to 3-4 years of age".
Most babies suck their thumbs.
A child who sucks his finger to satisfy his need for breastfeeding as a baby is sucking his finger after the age of one and a half to satisfy his mother's thirst for breastfeeding and relax.
"She can be bored and distracted, when she's sleepy, when she's nervous, and when she's gone", he said.
Dr. Bilgin Giray, who stressed that the underlying reason for the finger-sucking behavior in older age is the inability of the parent-child relationship and the lack of adequate confidence in the child, described the effects of this behavior on the dental health in these words:
The behavior of the finger sucking has a negative effect on the formation of the child's teeth.
The pressure during suckling causes the upper teeth to be pushed forward, while the lower teeth are pushed back.
This causes the lower jaw to position itself backwards, disturbing the balance of the jaw and tooth structure.
The physiological reflection is that speech disorder and closure look aesthetically unhealthy.
Dr. Giray, who noted that if no early solution is found, a much more complex treatment process can occur at the age of 6-7 when permanent teeth start to come out, said: "We can protect our children from joint and jaw problems before they are fully developed".
"So today, children need to be able to control their mouth structure, just like they do with their eyes and hearing".
New breath in nearsightedness: Trifugal Lens
After cataract treatment, patients naturally don't want to wear glasses.
For many years, focused lighting has been used to solve this problem in our patients.
The success of the treatment in this area has taken the trifocal markers that have recently been introduced a step further.
The difference between trifocal lenses and other angles is that they can provide clear vision not only at distant or near distances but also at distances defined as intervals.
Treatment of distant, near or intermediate vision impairments
In visual impairments, intervals represent a point that we often use in our daily lives.
For example, the dashboard of cars, the laptops we hold in our arms, or the distance we define as 60-70 centimeters in arm length.
And because trifocal lenses also adjust the spacing, our patients don't need glasses, no matter how close or far away.
Another advantage of trifocal lamps is that they reduce nighttime complaints.
Dr. Volkan Hürmerich, MD, "Trifocal lens therapy for all distance vision treatments is no different from normal cataract treatment".
Our trifocal patients recover easily with a procedure that takes seven to 10 minutes.
And the next day, our patients can return to their normal lives.
It is an operation that improves the quality of life, especially for people who drive, who use computers a lot, who love to read and live more active lives.
You can also see an eye specialist to see if this procedure is appropriate for you and can be used on any patient over the age of 18.
The venous vein is not used in heart surgery!
Varis is a disease that has been increasing in frequency in recent years.
In the case of a heir, where genetic proximity is the primary factor, long working hours, work that requires long standing and long sitting lead to an increase in heir complaints.
Are the veins used in heart surgery?
People often ask questions like, what if I have a heart attack?
Here are the answers to those questions.
There are two types of arterial system in the leg:
The 1st leg has what we call the deep vein system, which carries dirty blood to the lungs and collects the main dirty blood from the leg.
These are called deep femoral veins and superficial femoral veins.
These arteries are rarer, and their diseases prevent the veins from closing, and they are treated with medications to keep them open.
The leg has a superficial vein called the lateral pathway, which carries dirty blood to the lungs and joins the deep venous system in the pelvis.
This system consists of two large veins and two small veins, which we call vascular veins.
In all four of these veins, there may be insufficiency and inheritance.
The superficial veins used in heart surgery are called the great saphenous vein.
The absence of these veins does not cause any damage to the body and therefore can be used in heart surgery.
But for these veins to be used in heart surgery, they need to be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
The surgical removal of the varicose veins or laser-setting burning of the veins also reduces the workload of deep veins and makes the leg healthier.
A common misconception is that even hereditary veins can be used as a backup.
The venous vein is never and never used in heart surgery!
There are other veins that can be used in heart surgery.
The backup vascular systems that can be used in heart surgery are located under the chest cavity, around the stomach, and on the arm.
So it's not right to wait for the hereditary vein to be used for the heart and worry about it.

A meaningful message from Uzbekistan ahead of the Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun Özbek issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.
Here are the words of Dursun Özbek that highlighted the unity and solidarity in Turkish football:
Galatasaray and Beşiktaş, two of the most popular Turkish sports clubs, will face each other for the Super Cup at Konya Büyükşehir Torku Arena on Saturday evening, August 13.
This is not the first or last match in the rivalry between our two beautiful clubs that has been a century behind us.
But it's a very timely encounter.
As we all know, our country went through a great depression on the night of July 15.
The coup attempt of the FETO/PDY, a terrorist organization that represents our democracy, was overcome through the unity and solidarity of all sections of society.
We paid a heavy price as a nation that night.
We've given them martyrs.
We have a lot of gas.
This painful price has reminded us once again of the virtue of democracy, the necessity and importance of peace, not conflict, in these lands.
That night, the representatives of Turkish sports opposed the coup with one voice, one heart, and all stood together on the side of democracy.
In these critical times, we need the unifying power of sport more than ever.
I wish this match, which coincides with the second anniversary of the death of our precious rival, President Suleiman Seba, and the new football season named after the legendary captain of our club, Turgay Şeren, to be the beginning of a love and peaceful atmosphere in Turkish sport.
I wish that whatever the score at the end of the match, which will be played in front of the half-stage stands, Galatasaray and Beşiktaş fans, the winner will be our country and Turkish sports.

Scot Callum Skinner is flying home while Britain is gathering gold
While the British team trio defended their title from London 2012 Scotland's Callum Skinner won the men's race at the Rio race track last night.
The 23-year-old Glasgow racer took on the pioneering role of Sir Chris Hoy, a Scottish man who was proud of the legend as he returned home victorious in his New Zealand outfit.
Four years earlier, when Hoy won five of his six Olympic golds, Britain had a shocking victory.
And even though Hoy retired, they repeated that by finishing sixth at the World Championships in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert starter Jamie Staff.
They did it right when the Indians showed up.
Hoy's retirement also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Scot had already seen the potential he had, and the British coaches hadn't given up on Skinner.
Four years ago, with Hoy, Hindes broke the Olympic record in the qualifying round, but Kenny and Skinner were re-elected in the first round.
And the British trio is in a gold-winning duel.
Although Hindes was a little behind on his own tour, Kenny led the team, and Skinner endured.
Much of the transformation that made Hindes use a larger tool to slow himself down, and that allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace, was a change in strategy.
Hoy watched them from their spot as a BBC expert commentator, and when they got on the podium, Skinner, Kenny and Hindes caught his eye.
"It's an honorable comparison", said Skinner, 23, of Glasgow.
I'm only here to do my best and make my name known.
We broke the Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions.
That was really amazing.
There's no better way to win this.
Hindes admitted to deliberately falling off the track after a poor start after winning the 2012 London with Kenny and Hoy.
He later reacted to this comment and there was no way he could be in demand from Britain's rivals.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
"With all the British flags on the stand", said Hindes, "we felt like London".
We're a team that was formed just three months ago.
We've lost so many worlds, so it's really amazing to win the Olympics again.
This is just an event, a medal for a nation that has won seven of the 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If that's the measure of progress we've made in the last five months, we've got five more days to successfully race on the track.
Kenny's attitude suggests that Hoy's dream of repeating three Olympic golds in a single Olympics is not impossible.
This would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was born on March 23 (which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a sacred date in British sports history), would reach six gold medals and one silver medal.
That's the same level as Hoy.
Kenny, from now on, he's going to run a sprint race, which starts today and will last three days.
"I'm just enjoying it for now", said the 28-year-old Bolton.
Team events are always the best.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, you feel alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
Although this is just the action of today's medal, there is much good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-man, four-kilometer team event.
They completed the course in 3:51.943.
The world record set by the gold medalist in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will be decided in today's second half, and it's clear that Wiggins will be the focus of all attention.
Yesterday, before the ranking round, he had a falling out with officials when authorities called him to measure his height.
In the women's event, which will continue and finish tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The British team relies on a strong cycling team to take the reins and win many medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
After a major advantage in Beijing and London, expectations in Rio were significantly lower.
In the background, there have been many bad developments, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April for allegations of sexism and violence and the retirement of key figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night after the race on the track shows that Britain's legendary reputation for finishing in perfect time will be proven again this time.
The future of the Portland gas station is questionable.
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers fell into uncertainty after one of the plant's owners announced the termination of a supply contract that would lead to the dismantling of all supply contracts for the energy company that supplied the plant.
This move came after the Victorian government earlier this year decided not to exceed subsidies for the facility to continue operating.
The 20-year fixed-rate subsidy expires in November.
Alcoa's Portland plant could be at risk by 2000.
Any shutdown could put up to 2,000 jobs at risk, directly or indirectly.
And the power plant consumes about 10 percent of all Victoria's electricity, so there could be additional chain-linking effects.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry shut down the coal-fired power plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland refinery is losing money and facing the risk of closing.
These developments came after several years of speculation that the facility would be built on the strengthening of the Australian dollar and the recent cost of consumption of the facility.
AGL, which supplies power from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley to a large aluminum smelter, said it expects the other three owners to move to cancel their contracts.
The vast majority of the facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with CITIC in China and Marubeni Corp in Japan holding smaller stakes.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, which means the physical electricity demand of the coal-fired power plant will continue", he said.
AGL stated that the contracts were "risk balancing contracts" that would come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period and will be completed in 2017.
The energy company said, "Therefore, AGL will continue to expect contracts to contribute to the 2017 financial year as well".
The potential impact of AGL on potential gains for the 2018 financial year and beyond is limited to the adoption of a strong term contract position for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the value of its contracts in its accounts had already fallen to $187 million due to "expectations of disclosure".
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the power plant or provide electricity to the power plant".
The US-based company signed a 20-year contract in 2010 that was due to go into effect in November this year, but has not yet explained why it has not withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are also alert to the possibility of the closure of both the Portland post-war plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to economic difficulties in the sector.
Earlier this week, Stephen Mikkels, AGL's chief operating officer, who responded to analysts, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of power each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts.
If both of these facilities are withdrawn, it will cause a significant decline in demand in the [electricity] market.
And that's not a good development for us as producers".
Not only is Kardashian the star of the TV show, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, the fourth daughter of model and executive mother Kris Kardashian-Jenner, is on the cover of the highly anticipated September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has been a model at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday via Instagram.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this cover in a room full of people I loved".
Following the cover announcement, a bizarre (or simply a scripted) reality video featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (rob and Caitlyn, who were troublemakers at the bar, and everyone's favorite show-world uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) was released; the family forgot their sisters' cover in the video and then made a classic ending: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
Although this is the cliché story line of almost every "birthday" episode of all children's television programs (Seacrest says in a cartoon rabbit at 8am, "Did you think we forgot you?" sincerely), Kris had to somehow include the other girls in this introduction.
With this development in the September issue of Vogue, we're definitely entering a new era of Kardashians.
Kendall's sister Kim may have overtaken her in appearing on the cover of Vogue (she shared the cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a success in itself.
The September issue of Vogue became the best-selling issue of the year.
The number has attracted the attention of many advertisers for its thickness, more like a coffee table book than a fashion magazine (Fashionista found that 615 of the 832-page volumes last year contained advertising content).
The cover star's disclosure is also a process that has been closely monitored, with the magazine's images leaking before official announcements for the past two years.
Women who have been featured on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more about "modeling celebrities" than "famous models".
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the cover in 2013, and the following year, the honor was bestowed upon Lady Gaga.
But even if Ms. Jenner, described by the magazine as the "brightest model" of her generation, is included in the previous category, her environment is fairly good.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities or reality show stars or the youth of today who know how to make good Snapchat videos (although Jenner is all of them).
These are all women with legitimate talent, who are prominent in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who was featured on the cover last year, had one of the best moments of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of her background in reality shows, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be uncomfortable.
In June, she criticized the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour, Jenner, and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the concoctions of the times".
When news broke that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue, that thought came up again.
But it seems unreasonable to focus on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel, literally.
He's going to Marc Jacobs' parades.
Estee Lauder is taking care of you.
She and her sisters are selling their pictures on paid-for apps.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe she's just on the reality TV show to see her brother Kourtney and her kids.
Social legal support centers are deporting 160,000 people every year
As the sector prepares for the impact of further funding cuts on already challenging operations, more than 160,000 people from the nation's most vulnerable sections are being turned away from social legal support centers.
Three out of five people in Queensland (mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and those without resources to deal with unfair eviction decisions, etc.) are turned away when seeking free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have exhausted their resources, are preparing for further cuts.
Starting in June of next year, these legal aid centers are scheduled to be deprived of more than 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrel, Queensland Director of Community Legal Support Centres, said the latest Census Report of the National Association of Community Legal Support Centres found that thousands of people are turned away every year.
Mr. Farrel said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will get much worse.
"Queensland's social legal support centres are chronically receiving inadequate financial support, which means they are unable to access the vital services that thousands of people need", he said.
People in violent relationships, struggling with the power of government and the forces that make up the balance, families in the process of separation and unjustly dismissed workers... all face legal problems and, according to this report, are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leaving thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders facing more complex legal challenges without help.
We urge the Minister of Justice and the Senator for Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately withdraw these funding cuts so that people can get the support they need when they face a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Now we have to look at the investment that the Palaszczuk government will make in these important work in social legal support centers and the communities they serve.
Donald Trump's campaign team sued after staff claimed to have fired guns
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team has been sued for failure to act after the North Carolina operations director allegedly fired a weapon at a staff member while walking around in a zipper in February.
The case was announced Wednesday in a state court case brought by former software instructor Vincent Bordini of the state campaign team.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be handled from the inside but later realized "that it won't happen".
As Bordini's complaint notes, the Director, Earl Philip, "extracted a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and held the hammer towards Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same experience as Phillip after he complained to local and regional campaign team leaders.
"We don't need to fire weapons to cause damage", he said in his complaint.
The case was opened two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused outrage in North Carolina by saying that "the people of the Second Amendment" (apparently gun owners and gun backers) could take action if their opponent, Hillary Clinton, were elected and elected their own judges.
Trump's campaign team said the media took these words out of context and that he did not support violence.
Bordini is appealing to the campaign team for negligence and to Phillip for assault, battery and mental damage.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond quickly to the message asking for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip have been unsuccessful.
A local news outlet in Charlotte, WCCB reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
His call to Innovative Consulting Services, his consulting firm, was not promptly answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a contentious campaign.
Bordini, Donald J. Trump For President Inc., case 16-CS-14300, Court of Common Pleas, High Court Branch, Mecklenburg Accident (Charlotte) is the first case in which the President of the United States has been convicted of a felony.
"FETÖ" report the boy
Following President Erdoğan's call for FETO members to "do not know intelligence, do not know security, report", the MIT and the FETO Security established a newsline.
New practices are also being launched to identify "secret congregants" who hid while thousands of FETÖ members were expelled from institutions after the July 15 coup attempt.
In the framework of the studies, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stressed the importance of the reports that citizens make in the fight against FETO.
You need to report it to the prosecutor.
It's a patriotic debt.
"Everyone may not know intelligence, security or catch up, look, men are running away".
The Ministry of Interior, the Directorate General of Security and the National Intelligence Agency (MIT) launched an online reporting app.
According to this, the citizen can transfer the activities of the organization, the organizations that belong to the organization, to the security and ITU.
The information of the persons who submit the information in the form provided to the service via the links www.egm.gov.tr/pages/report, www.mit.gov.tr/katkiniz will be kept secret.
Anyone who wants to use the reporting app provided by the Directorate General of Security can also add the document.
In the same application, the informant will be returned to it if he so requests.
Citizens can also make these notifications to the Public Prosecutorships in their respective provinces and districts, as they can contact the "155 Police Aid" line by phone.
Inspired by Bodrum, they built a 'model village' in Sivas
The "model village" was built in cooperation with the Canköy, Kaymakamlık and charitable entrepreneur of SIVAS' Gölova County.
In the village, where the roads were paved and parkstone was laid on its sidewalks, all the houses were painted blue and white, taking the example of Muğla's Bodrum district.
The Lake Skiing Authority has developed a model village project to improve the image and quality of life of villages connected to the district.
In this context, the 66-digit Canköy, 12 kilometers from the county center, was chosen as the model village.
The village's roads were paved and the sidewalks were covered with park stones.
The village houses with different colours were painted with the support of businessman Selahattin Ayan, who owned Pelit Pastane.
The whole village was covered in the image of buildings painted white and blue.
BODRUM is EXAMPLE
Gölova Kaymakami Erkan İsa Erat, who informed about the project, said that they had prepared the project to sign a project that would also be a role model for other villages.
We were looking for a place to sample when we started this project.
When we went to the basement, we were struck by the white painted and blue windows of the houses.
We wanted to take Bodrum as an example because of the cleanliness of white and the positive impact it has on people.
We painted all the houses in Canköy white and blue.
This work was done in collaboration with the government and charity.
The project cost about 200,000 lire.
Our work has made our Canköy in Sivas a little Bodrum.
We want to continue this kind of work with the support of our budget and business people.
Abdullah Macit, 66, of the Autonomous community of Janköy, said that with the support of the Kaymakamlık, the village has a new image.
Macit thanked all who worked hard, saying that being an exemplary village pleases them and the villagers.
Drugs operation in Kangal
Seven people were arrested in a drug operation organized by the gendarmerie teams of SIVAS in Kangal district.
The police team working in the district's Chetinkaya Belt with the help of drug-detecting dogs searched for 600 grams of marijuana, 49 drugs, 1 hunting rifle and 1 dry-clear gun.
Seven people were detained and prosecuted for the seized materials.
Four people were seized along with Gülen in FETÖ/PDY case in Adana
It was decided to confiscate all the assets of Fethullah Gülen, Omar Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were tried and escaped in the 2nd Serious Criminal Court in ADANA for allegedly making a profit by corrupting the Fethullahist Terror Organization/Parallel State Creation (FETÖ/PDY).
In a report to the Adana Security Directorate on May 15, 2015, it was alleged that in 2012, the Mayor's Deputy Mayor Zihni Alkarmaz and his administration, through building corruption and plan counterfeiting, converted the land belonging to Kanuni University to a residential area, which would have reached 150 million lira, despite the fact that it was not decided by the parliament.
As a result of the investigation, Zihni Aldırmaz, Ferat Yüksel, Mustafa Vural, Hasan Uzun and former Adana Trade Exchange Chairman Muammer Çalışkan were arrested.
Five of the 17 defendants, including Fethullah Gülen and former Adana Metropolitan Mayor's Deputy Zihni Aldırmaz, were charged with 5-35 years in prison.
While all defendants did not admit to the charges, in the final phase of the trial, all the detainees were released under judicial review and a foreign ban.
The Mal VARLIKLARINA hand is on
The court has issued an arrest warrant for Omar Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who escaped with the number one accused in the case, Fethullah Gülen.
However, the fugitive who was not caught and did not attend the trial decided to conduct a court-ordered escape for the four defendants.
The court decided to confiscate all property of Fethullah Gülen, Omar Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in a foreign country and therefore could not reach him, in order to ensure that the case against them remained unresolved.
The court's decision also froze the assets, land-sea and air transport vehicles, all types of rights and receivables, valuables, shares in the company, and bank accounts of the fugitive.
MLKP member Arslan arrested with turban

Aksaray police, acting on the instructions, found Serpil Arslan, who was wearing a turban to avoid identification, eating at a restaurant.
As the crew entered the restaurant, the lion, noticing the police were coming, tried to run to the back door.
Serpil Arslan, who walked out the back door, was caught by the TEM Branch of Aksaray Security Directorate.
After his interrogation at the Adana Security Directorate, Serpil Arslan was taken to court.

The controlling interest fund is back in commission.
The Turkish Asset Fund, which is expected to be among the world's largest funds, has been silently banned for protests.
It was decided to renegotiate the fund due to the lack of a control mechanism, but it was renegotiated without any changes.
Utku Çakırözer, CHP MP and member of the Planning and Budget Commission, who evaluated the Turkish Assets Fund proposal to sozcu.com.tr, said: "We are absolutely opposed to keeping this structure, which will consist of mandatory pension cuts to be taken from public assets, workers, employees, unemployment funds collected for the unemployed, outside of the Constitutional control mechanisms".
The Turkish Assets Fund, which the government has prepared to provide long-term funding for investments and projects, was outlawed on Tuesday, with the opposition saying it should be discussed further.
But the AKP today brought the proposal back to the Planning and Budget Commission in the same way.
The member of the TBMM Planning and Budget Commission, Utku Chakırözer, told sozcu.com.tr about the concerns of the CHP regarding the Proposal for the Assets Fund law.
"When the creation of this fund came to the Planning and Budget Commission in the bag bill, our former Finance Minister, Zakariya Temizel, who headed the CHP committee, expressed our concerns and proposed that this bag be removed from the law and discussed in detail".
The government, which accepted our position, withdrew the bill.
The design came back in the same form yesterday.
"The government seems to be insisting on removing it from the legislature within a week", he said.
He said that the existence of the Fund should be agreed upon.
"The public assets, the mandatory retirement cuts to be taken from the worker, the income from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, the income from privatization, are transferred irregularly outside the control of the Assembly and the Election and to a structure with no responsibility", he said.
He said that Russia, China and the Gulf countries where such funds were established had surpluses in oil revenues and trade, and that the fund was financed in this way, "But we have a savings gap".
So the fund will be made up of public resources, that is, the people's money.
The total unemployment fund is planned to transfer 100 billion, from the individual pension fund, which is forced to employees, 100 billion, from the private pension fund, 50 billion, without privatization.
"That means that this fund, which will be entirely made up of public money, must be under public control and that this money should not be spent irresponsibly", he said.
He stressed that it is unacceptable to keep a fund where state resources are collected, and state assets are guaranteed in debt, outside the control of the Assembly.
The work and transactions of collecting, spending, and borrowing such a large public asset cannot be done solely through the supervision of independent audit firms.
There must be public oversight and a transparent structure.
The bill does not provide for the constitutional oversight and transparency of the Fund.
There's no limit on how many resources can be transferred.
No one will ever be able to account for the use of this fund.
The purpose of the fund is to justify the financing of large projects.
You don't need to set up an uncontrolled fund outside of budget.
Why don't you just put it in the budget?
And then naturally, the question arises, "Why are the SAiishtaş and the Mejlis escaping control?"
He said that they are not opposed to the transfer of the money accumulated in the Asset Fund, but that it is done through opaque, unreckoning mechanisms.
But if the government insists on this, then we have to ensure that the international standards that apply in other countries where such investment funds are established are also applicable in Turkey.
It must be structured in such a way as to bring about a mechanism of control and accountability.
It must be set up in such a way that no scams will be found on it, and the citizen will be able to pay his own money to the next penny.
He said that the AKP is "satisfied that it is listening to our criticism in the Assembly after the July 15 coup attempt".
We hope that in this bill, the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism.
We are against the illegal use, transfer, irresponsibility of the national assets and the lack of public oversight.
"The Willful Existence Fund can only be useful if these concerns are removed", he said.
It was learned that the proposal was being worked on to achieve reconciliation between the AKP and the opposition.
"The investment we make is a sign of our trust in Turkey"
Speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, Ford Automotive Board Chairman Ali Koch said, "The 30 billion TL investment we have made in the last 5 years is an indication of our confidence in the future of our country".
Koç Holding Executive Board Vice President and Ford Automotive Executive Board Chairman Ali Koç and the managing director of a large number of foreign capital firms met at the meeting on the topic "Those who trust Turkey, manufacture in Turkey" organized by Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Speaking at the meeting, Ali Koch said, "Our faith and confidence in our country with our partners is not only expressed, but we are filling it with our investments and actions".
The 30 billion TL investment we have made in the last 5 years is a sign of our confidence in the future of our country.
Turkey is a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy of international standards, a qualified workforce and an ecosystem that encourages R&D, innovation, entrepreneurship and added value.
In the last few years, our government has offered our industrialists the most comprehensive incentives in the history of our Republic.
"I believe that with these incentives and comprehensive strategies, we can start a new 'investment movement' that we need.
"No more events are a problem for just one country, we know that as global players", said Huseyin Gelis, Chairman and CEO of Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey.
We came to Turkey with a long-term view.
If we are united and united, our problems will be solved.
We were able to bring back to this land what wasn't in Turkey 160 years ago.
We will continue to be in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we will build factories, but we must have a clear horizon in this area", he said.
Shell Turkey President Ahmet Erdem said that Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for them.
We sincerely believe in the potential and future of Turkey.
We've invested in a lot of areas, first and foremost energy, and we're still investing.
We thank our President, Prime Minister and Ministers for their support of international investors.
Confident studies are being conducted for international investors.
"This is in the direction of increasing the competitiveness of our country", he said.
Dr. Altan Demirdere, President of Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and Middle East Region, said that on 10 August, our Global CEO would come to Turkey.
But the trip was postponed.
We were against it.
Because the CEO's arrival was so important.
They've made requests for bulletproof cars, protection.
Then when he came here, he saw that everything was normal.
He left his guard and car and happily returned to his country.
Investing in a country is like marriage.
First of all, if all goes well, you get engaged and you get married with long-term plans.
We're married to Turkey and we have no intention of divorcing.
He's turned over the edge!
Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım attended a conference call on "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry at Swiss Hotel.
Prime Minister Yildirim said that the industry sector is the sector that will provide Turkey with comparative advantage.
"If we are to be a high-value add-on, a locomotive of our country and we want to achieve our 2023 targets, we need to think about the industrial revolution, the information and technology revolution and achieve it".
Prime Minister Yildirim added that Turkey had come back from a huge precipice on the night of July 15, saying, "Those who mean the future of our country, those who try to destroy democracy, those bastards who do not even shy away from bombing our Gaza Assembly, if they were successful, today we are talking about another Turkey".
We would talk about a Turkey among the third world countries, which was seized by a coup, the national will was abolished and the world dropped out of the League of Developing Countries.
"Thank God, with the wisdom of our people, the leadership of our Chief Commander, our President, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the determination of our government, we have overcome this disaster", he said.
Prime Minister Yildirim continued: "We will quickly get out of the impact of this event and look ahead".
It's never right to live with a constant blow.
We have very ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake the Turkish economy.
Those who awaited chaos and crisis were wrong once again.
Today, our democracy and our economy are healthy.
Our banking sector, our finance sector continues to function in a healthy way.
The foreign trade deficit appears to have fallen by 25 percent in 2015.
The current account deficit rate of GDP fell from 5.8 percent in 2014 to 4.5 percent in 2015.
We're aiming to get it down to four by the end of this year.
We will never change our stance on public finances.
Turkey's 2016 budget was also above the national income of 130 countries.
We have reduced the national income gap to 1.3 percent in 2015, which is over 11 percent, and we are trying to maintain that.
We are better off in public debt than the EU, than many countries around the world.
Our banking and financial sector is operating on a solid footing.
"Our central bank has not felt the need to exchange currency into the market after July 15 and we have a gross reserve of over $121 billion, without any reduction in our reserves".
Prime Minister Yildirim said that the development of the economy, the increase in production and the creation of new employment areas will provide all kinds of facilities, "We also make comprehensive arrangements to relieve you of your burdens towards the past".
We have enacted and continue to enact many regulations until the stock-free cash-and-income tax credit is re-established.
"You continue to produce for the country, continue to trust your country, and your government will continue to remove the obstacles in front of you one by one".

Turkey is not breaking away from the West, it is not abandoning the European Union
Mehmet Shimshek: Turkey is not breaking away from the West, it is not abandoning the European Union
Deputy Head of the State Mehmet Shimshek, Minister of Science and Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci, attended the meeting on the topic "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Speaking at the meeting, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü said, "I think that many positive results have been achieved from the developments that took place on the night of July 15 and beyond".
The most important of these is undoubtedly the spirit of unity and solidarity that all Turkey is feeling deeply at this moment.
The July 15 process showed how strong the Turkish economy has been and how democratic society has been.
"It is clear that for a society that has achieved this level in economics and democracy and democracy, the next process will go better, easier and faster", he said.
"I must get rid of this turmoil in Turkey"
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said that they had been struggling to tell the world about the July 15 coup attempt that took place in Faruk Özlü.
Zeybekci also mentioned the interest rate cuts that banks have recently started, saying, "If 63.4% of the first five percent of my real estate sector's profits go to interest, we should focus on this business, we should give up our entire business".
That's why our president's been doing this.
Turkey must get out of this trouble with the real estate sector, the banking system, the government, the politics, the unity of the politics after the civil democratic revolution of 15 July.
We welcome recent developments in this regard.
"I hope that in the coming period, we will achieve sustainability and continuity by supporting this competition, which started downwards like the monthly zero point nine, eight, which banks have started with the encouragement of our President", he said.
"YESHIL PASPORT, we will obey the orders of our father"
"We will be the ducks in the coming period", said Nihat Zeybekci, "under the leadership of our President, our Prime Minister, we will not leave a country that has not been visited in the world, we will not leave a door that has not been stolen".
We're not leaving anyone out of touch about how to grow our business.
"We will never and never ignore this, and we will not be a bird in the hand as we chase the bird in the branch".
Zeybekci also noted that in the future, the exporters will be given green passports, saying, "One of the latest decisions is that its law came out, and we have now finished its administration in the Ministry of Economy; we will give our exporters, approximately 17 to 20 thousand exporters, a privileged green passport representing this country, to our exporter's order".
"The Devil Needs to Clean Up Those Who Are In My Stairs"
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Shimsek, referring to the July 15 coup attempt and the OHAL declared afterwards, described the coup attempt as a "cabus" and said: "But it is behind us, now we have to look ahead".
He said that the OHL was declared for two simple reasons: "Of course, those involved in this coup attempt must be cleared of the state and this process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to prevent such coup attempts once again".
And that's when the climate for these administrative reforms was called for, and so far, very serious structural reforms have been made.
"We have done all this, and we will continue to do it, within democratic principles and the rule of law", he said.
He said that life had returned to normal in many areas, and stressed that there was no reason for concern among companies and individuals who were not involved in terrorist financing.
"I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have solidified, because when you look at the root of recent problems, you will surely see that this betrayal network is involved.
"So the purge of this terrorist organization from the state, the fact that this period is closing in Turkey will strengthen Turkey's democracy", he said.
He said that the economy is generally solid and that it has never lost momentum and is returning to normal structural reforms.
We can't do it without structural reforms, because populism, protectionism, is on the rise.
"Turkey can prepare for the future only by reforming it", he said.
Finally, Shimsheq stressed that Turkey will not break away from the West, saying that "Turkey may sometimes have disagreements with our Western allies, our friends, but Turkey is not breaking away from the West, it is not abandoning the European Union".
He jumped out of the sea and...
In Antalya, 17-year-old Shamil Tayyar Blagakçı jumped from a 25 meter high falecast called 'Eagle Hill' into the sea to fish and became a hospital.
Shamil Tayyar Bharakchi, who was swimming with his friends at the Konya underwater beach in the evening, then jumped to sea from the 25 meter high falets known as "Kartal Hill" under the variant.
A professional swimmer, Shamil Tayyar Blagrakçı, injured his neck after hitting the water.
The flag bearer, who struggled to navigate the sea, was shore-fired by his friends, who were also professional swimmers like himself.
According to reports, the health workers at the scene took Shamil Tayyar Blagrakçı to the Antalya Training and Research Hospital by ambulance.
The flag bearer who was treated was not listed as life-threatening.
A friend of the flag bearer, who testified to police, "had a neck injury when he jumped fishing off Eagle Hill".
"We didn't expect it to be like this", he said.
25 dead - Spokesman
Residences in Sarmada township, Idlib province, Syria, about 10 kilometers from the Cilvegözü border gate in Reyhanlı district of Hatay, were hit by regime planes.
Local sources reported that 25 people were killed and 40 injured in the attack.
Two separate airstrikes were carried out by regime planes on the opposition-controlled Sarmada town near the Bab-Al Air Border Gate in Syria, opposite the Cilvegözü Border Gate, at noon and noon.
Local sources said the airstrikes targeted settlements and killed 25 people.
The blast was also heard from Reyhanli, where 40 people were reportedly injured, while the death toll is feared to rise.
President Erdogan has elected Kaya to the KLA!
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has elected H. Abdullah Kaya, Deputy Minister of Finance, as a member of the Council of Higher Education (CHE).
The statement from the Presidency said, "Our President, the Vice President of the Ministry of Finance H. Abdullah Kaya has been elected as a member of the Higher Education Council, which was dissolved due to the resignation of Seyit Ahmet Baş, in accordance with Article 6 (1) (b) of the Higher Education Law No. 2547".
On the other hand, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has approved the "International Labour Law" No. 6735.
The press release from the Presidential Press Center states that "The International Labour Law No. 6735 was sent to the Prime Minister for publication by our President in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 89 of the Constitution and the second paragraph of Article 104 (a) of the Constitution".
Two brothers killed in an armed attack in Kahta
Two brothers were killed in a car attack in Kahta District of ADIYAMAN.
The incident took place in the evening on Mustafa Kemal Street.
A 39-year-old car with 02 KH 839 plates under the direction of Ramazan Karahan, who was driving to the district center, was shot by an unidentified person.
The car under Karahan's control, which lost control with the fire, crashed into another vehicle.
Meanwhile, the man who came to the car, Ramazan Karahan, shot his brother, 50-year-old Omar Karahan, one by one.
The Karahan brothers were seriously injured, and the assailant fled the scene on a motorcycle.
Police and medical personnel were dispatched to the scene on the report.
The seriously injured Karahan brothers were taken to Kahta State Hospital by ambulance.
Omar and Ramazan Karahan, who were treated in the emergency department, were not saved despite all the efforts of doctors.
While the bodies of the two brothers were being put in the morgue for autopsy, police investigating the mob and security cameras in the area where the incident took place, began work to identify the fleeing assailant.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will provide renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and London but also across the country.
I think that the incredible efforts we've made to make all these nations and regions benefit from the Games will make Heathrow quite attractive, just like London did in 2012.
The Olympics have been a huge asset to Stratford and the East End.
And we're going to do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We'll create 10,000 new internships for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs, and we're not going to leave young people out of work around the airport.
As London did before 2012, there will be those who think the fight to expand Heathrow is too difficult.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would be a disgrace to the world.
Those who doubt were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions.
Heathrow, like the Olympics, is not just a few people's infrastructure project, it's a lot of people's infrastructure.
The expansion creates 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion of economic growth, leaving behind many skills and jobs around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who put in place a £11 billion infrastructure investment on time and budget for the world's two busiest runways, from T5 (which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years) to T2.
Now, we're ready to offer a third runway backed by private investment worth £16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the UK, and I have no doubt the Heathrow expansion will be.
It's time to channel this Olympic spirit into the expansion of Heathrow to secure our commercial future and create many skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, Chairman of Heathrow's Board and former Secretary of Commerce at the Treasury
Adblock Plus is "like a cat-and-mouse game" when it comes to blocking Facebook ads.
One of the companies that makes attempts to block ad blocking software for companies that make money from online ads says it's like a "cat-baiting game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters to block ads on social networks.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the code around the ads to make it harder for ad blockers to identify which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock says it's now unlocking new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this forward-thinking back-fight between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to prevent it has been going on since ad blocking was invented", and that Facebook may soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company is getting into this fight shows just how much concern the advertising blockers are for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, nearly 200 million people worldwide use ad blocking, four times the number of people using such software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
A spokesperson said that mobile ad blockers have been chasing ad blockers on the company's desktop because Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram are not effective for social media.
Facebook thinks it's worth investing in, so desktop ads should still be able to generate enough revenue.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced it would update its "ad preferences" tool to help people better control the ads they're being offered.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying, and that they would block some non-advertising content on the site.
A Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement, "This is not a good experience for people, and we plan to address this issue".
Adblockers are a blind tool, so we're focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
A woman runs into a Swiss motorway; it looks like suicide
Victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
Police are looking for witnesses who witnessed a car hit her on the highway in what appears to be a suicide on Thursday morning.
The incident occurred just after midnight on Thursday on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman lay "hopelessly" on the ground in the dark of the night and was hit by several vehicles.
A 49-year-old Swedish woman who was clearly suicidal was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He himself died on the spot.
Police said they had met with several drivers involved in the incident but some were unidentified and asked them and everyone involved to contact them.
"A criminal prosecution has been launched as a 'reasonable' step in such cases", said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it is not yet known whether the drivers involved will face any charges.
Couldn't they have avoided a collision?
That's what the prosecutor needs to find out".
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers will not be held liable.
In both cases (both involving a person walking on the highway in the dark), the newspaper ruled that it was normal for drivers not to wait for a lane to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer who crashed into a man lying on the road near Paynerne on the A1 one night in August 2014 was found not guilty of causing death by negligence.
In court, the 22-year-old victim was found to be drunk and leaking on the street.
The court said that the police officer responding to an emergency call was using the vehicle reasonably and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unforeseeable situation".
Anyone with information about this incident near Morges on Thursday should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for life
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus once had habitable conditions.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its warm, waterless surface and CO2-filled atmosphere, could host conditions similar to those once on Earth.
Scientists have described Venus' low rotation speed in the past with a thick layer of atmosphere.
But the latest estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet be able to rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of ancient Venus.
Although its planet has more dry regions than Earth, it may have once had sufficient water and protection from rapid evaporation through geographic variability.
Ancient Venus also benefited from a 30 percent looser sun.
GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news release: "In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus's slow rotation made it possible for its daytime side to rotate around the sun for almost two months at a time".
This warmed the surface, creating thick clouds that moved like an umbrella to protect it from sun-induced heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures were only a few degrees colder than the Earth today.
The model allowed a similar story to be created for Venus, similar to the evolution previously proposed by planetary scientists as a hypothesis.
Although once habitable, Venus has been exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light over a period of several billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and the water vapor was destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.
The hydrogen ran out, leaving behind only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse gas, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in their Geophysical Studies articles.
Patrick Roy resigned from the Avalanche antenna.
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as assistant to the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations, saying the team was not given a say in the decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the development and said the club would immediately begin looking for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", said Roy, 50.
I've spent the summer thinking about how I can improve and take this team to the next level by giving them the depth they need.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be in perfect alignment with the vision of the organization.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect his team's performance.
In the present case, these conditions are not yet met.
Sakich, who signed Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today of his decision", said Sakic.
He's grateful for everything he's done for our organization and we wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach in his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He scored 112 points and led the team to a first-place finish in the league, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason both years.
The Avalanche improved on their 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16, five points short of what was needed for the second-jocker field in the Western Conference.
Roy, a Hall of Fame goalie, two Montreal Canadiens, both won four Stanley Cups, both for the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers suspend strike and continue negotiations
The strike was suspended because of the salaries of the North Sea oil workers, and the chief negotiators began discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against oilfield services company Wood Group is being carried out in stages on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
A joint statement stated that "We have decided to restart the process to resolve the existing dispute with Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions".
Over the next few weeks, starting next week, we'll have a whole day of meetings to take a new view of the issues.
The trade unions said that this was the first protest against wage cuts of up to 30 percent in 25 years.
Wood Group cut payments to its North Sea shippers by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressures.
After this fee reduction process, the company also applied a 10 percent price reduction to coastal loaders in 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would give the company the space to weather the market's downturn.
Shell laid off thousands of people in the process of restructuring its operations as part of its merger with British energy company BG Group and announced plans to cease oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low crude oil prices, an economic situation that was triggered by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson will meet with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in the North Sea.
As he himself said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
He said in a statement: "We need an economy that is effective for the majority, not for the minority in the North Sea and across the country".
Despite an average investment of about $7 billion over the past five years, in 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea.
Kepler measured the rotational speed of stars in the Milky Way.
The Kepler space telescope, with its latest mission, has helped astronomers create the most complete catalogue of stars in the Milky Way in terms of their orbital velocities.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in a galaxy orbit at varying speeds and how rotation periods are related to planet formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a news release: "When we compare our results to galaxies, we hope to be able to learn more about the relationship between the mass, age, and even the past of the solar system of a star".
The country's star is 445 light-years from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation formed 125 million years ago and are reaching a new level of maturity.
They're moving at the highest speed possible in their lifetimes.
At peak rotation speeds, stars in this maturation stage form a large amount of stellar wind.
These winds have a fracturing effect on the stars as they move through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As a star ages, its rate of rotation begins to decrease.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of noticeable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotational speeds suggests that larger stars rotate faster than smaller stars.
Rebull compared the stars to dancers, saying that the older ones perform their turns on one leg more slowly than the younger ones.
Rebull said, "We see that in the 'balker' we see stars that turn slowly are heavier, and those that turn fast are very light".
Because the country's star is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the star's properties with its rotational speeds.
Rebull said "the homeland team provides theoretical models for star rotations in both directions, young and old".
We'd like to know more about how, when and why the stars spin, and why they leave their 'dance shoes' in a corner, if that's possible.
Rebull and his colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotational velocities of the Ulker constellation in three new articles to be published in the Astronomy Journal shortly.
