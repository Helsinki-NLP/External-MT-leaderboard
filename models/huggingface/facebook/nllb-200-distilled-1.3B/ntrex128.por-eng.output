Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid of going through the moat
There is dismay from some Members of the Assembly for Wales (AM) over the suggestion that its title be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy lies in plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, from all political stripes, fear that this will make them look ridiculous.
A Labour MP stated that the group is concerned that the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means idiot and pwp means excrement.
A Plaid AM stated that the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP stated that the group was mindfully open to the name change, but noted that the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Muppets).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The House Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: 'The final decision on how Members of the House are appointed will obviously be made by the Members themselves.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed widespread support for the proposal to designate the assembly as the 'Wales Parliament'.
On the issue of the title of the MA, the Commission favoured 'Members of the Welsh Parliament', or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the MAs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus could be a headache for the President, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill on the amendments within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on disqualification of MPs and the configuration of the committee system.
When debating legislation, the MSs will have the final say on how they should be appointed.
Macedonians will vote on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with neighboring Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to its EU and NATO accession applications.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has declared that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is nothing more than the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells go off at a time when Harlem's churches are struggling to survive.
"In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither".
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understandable.
"People socialize differently today", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people go regularly".
As for the churches, he worries that the money made from the sale of property may not last as long as the leaders hope and that sooner or later everything will return to exactly where it started".
Churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condos inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the neighborhood shrines that remain.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said,  and so this will hasten the day when these churches will all close, since most of those who move into these complexes are unlikely to join these congregations".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later taken over by a black congregation that held its services nearby.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black employees.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when plans were made for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather claimed St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that it would "seek to pass on the costs" to it, displeased that it had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old teenager at a lobster hunt dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday during a lobster hunt dive in California on the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, and then rowed toward him with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming "I was bitten!"
I got bit!
The entire area of the collarbone was torn, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is unknown what species of shark was responsible for the attack.
Life-saver Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetics sections, backed by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain market share in the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and homewares decline, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out in more stores next year if successful.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the supermarket's search for ways to use exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would double its beauty product catalogue with the offering of up to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its boutique make-up range to make most products vegan, something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the shift from eating habits to small daily quantities in convenience stores have led supermarkets to now have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble department stores, at a time when the supermarket chain is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also installed a number of Habitats since acquiring both chains two years ago, and claims that this has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from health-care stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its 281-shop pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million.
It was told by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores a wider range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics sections to provide a more pleasant environment for our customers.
We also invest in the specialised training of colleagues who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the inviting atmosphere and convenient locations make us now an irresistible beauty store that breaks with the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby walked away from £11m deal
Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, was "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby abandoned an £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly branded home goods and accessories.
Both of their businesses had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was leaving the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones livid by leaving the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on his highly profitable new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which could be worth up to £1.5 million) meant she would no longer have time to devote to her Truly brand of homewares and accessories.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was projected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was catching a plane to one of his overseas vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's highest priority.
It would mean a long-term resolution of their future and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely stunned.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at headquarters in Marlow".
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions, given the heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares, and the potential for further launch delays.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we have no intention of commenting on his business dealings".
"Hard talk and then we fell in love"
The US president jokingly mentioned criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unfitting for a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so easily?
Trump said in his fake "news anchor" voice.
"I did not give in to anything".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
However, negotiations for denuclearisation are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North sees no "corresponding response" from the US to the first steps toward North Korea's disarmament.
He said the US was instead pursuing sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"It's going very well with North Korea", he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: an end to rocket tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of U.S. military personnel to the country.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia wreak havoc on an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international aid to be channelled.
'Unfortunately, in many cases they have been clear that they are not asking for international help, so it becomes a bit difficult,' said Ms Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, there is no guarantee that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the ravages of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, unlike the existence of a warning, likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made improving decrepit infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, spent huge sums on roads and railways.
However, funding shortages have plagued Mr Joko's executive at a time when he faces re-election next year.
The president is also coming under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catana, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long throw for the draw goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool side from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He made a touchdown to his left before making a shot toward the second bar.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed for the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball landed on a flying Kepa Arrizabalaga and landed inside the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq go as far as they can, so I was just buying as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made a call and didn't think too much about it.
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
On that move, the blue forward gave a heel pass back to Mateo Kovacic before breaking out near midfield and making a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to center field.
Then he made a beautiful shot that went through the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
He overtook the defenses and scored against the second-half goal with a left-footed shot that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at three o'clock on Thursday afternoon in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said early Sunday.
Reports describe large numbers of people trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings during Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake, which sent waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman to death.
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The victim, 44, was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging residents in the area who may have witnessed something to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images from billboard cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us as they may have crucial information for the investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police say they are currently informing the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he was informed of what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being told they can't return to their homes for another few hours.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
He repeatedly says, "It's so horrible".
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers have been deployed inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone with information to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 with registration 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest monument swallowed up in the quarrel of "historical revisionism"
The removal of the monastery would be an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which is reminiscent of the destruction by the Taliban of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a folly" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable that in the current debate over the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell by the Palace of Westminster would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to nineteenth-century opinion and some historiography of a figure many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more so in the late nineteenth century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressures, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an entirely accurate description is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure of individual notoriety who represents one side of that divide.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honour and celebration".
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead, with a severed artery and covered in blood, near a market pit in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pigsty open.
In that hole, he said, was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 227-pound pig had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed", said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports claim that Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as a "stimulus".
"They're just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the respect they deserve", he said.
Hurricane Rosa debris is expected to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday, Rosa was causing gusts of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane located 400 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean moving toward the west coast of the U.S. As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push strong tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, it will cause rainfall that may reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rainfall can cause dangerous flash floods, debris floods and possibly desert landslides.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 millimeters of precipitation is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with conditions rapidly worsening due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly unwise to walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall can turn gorges into wild rivers and thunderstorms will bring occasional high winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small debris floods and slippery roads.
This may be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical downpours will begin to occur in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain becomes more scattered late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October may see sharp temperature variations across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a prime example of the dramatic temperature differences across the central US on Sunday.
There's a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm early October, with temperatures ranging from 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit [27-30°C] from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could hit 90 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States by the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh 's hearing .
More than 20 million people watched yesterday on six television stations the stirring testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, stated that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people, as measured by Nielsen on Friday, were likely to have watched the hearing.
The company counted the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring audiences of office-based viewers.
To give you some perspective, this is a similar audience level to the end of a football game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Then come CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being verbally assaulted by protesters as he tried to board an elevator to address a Judiciary Committee hearing.
The senator stood motionless, staring at the ground as he was criticized live on CNN cameras.
"I'm here in front of you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
She was told, "You have power whereas so many women have no power at all".
Flake claimed that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and radio stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee went to vote to move Kavanaugh's nomination forward to a vote in the full Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee within the next week, which the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicising' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicising" Britain's future and harming the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another front-page interview, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on the minister's so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU cover each other's tariffs is "totally absurd".
Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to a news release from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them from the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, a CBS affiliate, reports.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had fatally shot Wayde with a gun.
Bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head extending to the neck.
The department says the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area residents who collaborated on the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area officials for their "diligence and effort to obtain justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This 6'2" forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what we are constantly concerned about", Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in a 24-hour period.
The center detected numerous deafening noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) from the capital, since a magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and intervention police as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the one-year anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, stopped by the intervention police, hit it with eggs and sprayed powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes also took place later, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the clashes.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups chanting "We do not forget, we do not forgive" clashed with unionist protesters, who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region, a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, with a majority boycott by those against.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was taking part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year was our best.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we are blocked", he said.
Despite winning a vital but tangible victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
He said: "I am very pleased that the Commission has taken the initiative to launch a new programme to combat poverty and social exclusion.
Londonderry: men arrested after car crash into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30pm BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may have also shot a beast into the car.
Menga's attack gives a 1-0 win to Livingston over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
Livingston, promoted to the top flight, stunned Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat of just two in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's attack made all the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team is changing levels, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side, still without a home victory in the top flight this season, face the leaders Hearts, with eight points to spare, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended its streak of undefeated division games to six, with head coach Holt going undefeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against stunned visitors.
Holt's team should have gotten ahead of the score long before the goal, as the incisive nature of his play was causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense but was dragged in front of goal and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after he slipped to find Craig Halkett's head shot over the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of it, knowing it could cause problems for the visitors on the pitch.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free throw and Livingston got an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to pass to Menga, who hit a touchdown pass and scored from the center of the big area.
At this point, the Rangers dominated possession, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalie Liam Kelly had no major issues.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was thwarted by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow hit a long-range touchdown from another standing shot by Livingston.
Crosses continued to come into the large Livingston area, which were successively settled, and two complaints of a large penalty, one after Halkett's charge on substitute Glenn Middleton and another after a hand, were refused by the umpire.
Livingston "phenomenal" - the analysis of the
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They have been excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and personnel have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to commend Holt for the way he has galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall at their best throughout the game.
Anyway, the Rangers showed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team fell far short of those standards.
Their final play was uninspired (they only managed to open the home team once), serving as a warning to Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives ambiguous welcome in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside its country.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters turned out nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Motorcycle crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving an automobile in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at around 10:15am BST.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died at the scene.
This collision comes months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
Barriers and detours for buses have been put in place, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in rioting
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The disturbances, which are still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 0930 British Summer Time on Saturday.
Special agents Tornado were called in to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Services spokesman said: "Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be released to the police and they can spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, police officers were called in to help with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought-affected areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's exactly what's forecast for early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa will sweep through the southwestern desert, implying the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for parts of southern and eastern Nevada, southern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with heavy rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5 to 10 millimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts reaching 15 millimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals up to 10 mm.
For those unaffected by flash flood risks, the rain from Rosa may be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall may be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second-severest category", reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the mainland through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-force Sunday morning, with winds of up to 85 miles per hour, is 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
It is expected to make landfall in coastal Mexico as a tropical storm late afternoon or late afternoon on Monday.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, raising a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 8 to 10 millimeters is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with maximum of 25 millimeters possible", reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then moving south to Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger from Rosa or its remnants is very high rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert", said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are predicted to produce flash floods and life-threatening debris floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder .
Three teenage males and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 4:00 a.m. British Summer Time on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers are appealing to anyone who can pull cellphone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump claimed Kavanaugh was "a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his claim.
The president said Saturday that "the American people witnessed the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a sideways reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running, but I am actually running", he said.
"That's why I'm running around fighting for great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party deputy told CNN.
Hundreds dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami; number still rising
At least 384 people died, many of them washed up on the beaches by giant waves, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves up to 20 feet high hit the beach in the evening, dragging many to their deaths and leaving a trail of devastation in their path.
The tsunami occurred following a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, having been victims of what happened", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't move by itself: it swept cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 500 miles per hour before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and knocked down bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be rocked by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have amplified the magnitude of the tsunami, the statement said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings were found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage may be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people in the area", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials claimed that the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be seen screaming frantic warnings of an approaching tsunami to people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water broke off the shore, washing away buildings and automobiles.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other basic items.
The city's airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is rising exponentially to over 800.
It's really bad.
Although they managed to reach Palu City safely, where staff are housed in canvas shelters set up in the courtyard of their offices, Donggala's World Vision staff encountered scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"I was told that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid groups began the grim task of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel may only enter the site if it is declared a 'national disaster area'.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still at a provincial catastrophe level", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist".
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the still missing still held out hope that their loved ones were part of the miracles that dampen the grim headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior paraglider, I have to carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse began circulating among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu athletes who were attending the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark instead of a pair of blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a cash machine refill at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement park and preparing to introduce more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running after the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was meant for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The move comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
While it is an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when commenting on the title of his album to radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the one", to just Ye -- being just a reflection of our good, our bad, our mess, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
Kanye is one of a number of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known alternately as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator JAY-Z also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory strike against students.
López Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Military fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have reached 300, as leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting them monthly scholarships and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China ramps up its artificial intelligence activity, the United States should double its spending on research in this area, said investor and AI professional Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several US government departments made announcements related to AI, even though the country does not have a formal global strategy on the subject.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to lead AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are in pursuit of the next AI revolution", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI success being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American player in Othello.
Lee gave credit to previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Department's Agency for Advanced Research Projects Robotics Challenge and asked when it would be next, with a view to helping identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to go to great lengths to obtain government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that is stealing academic leaders; it's corporations", he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the US boost its AI efforts.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to PhDs in AI", he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations use to fund researchers in the United States.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is designed to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Joint Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians went to the polls on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether turnout will be enough to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum was: 'Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue efforts to admit Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to EU and NATO bodies.
"I have come today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters turned out to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in a referendum on changing the country's name, which would open the door for its membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was setting up a small stage and setting up chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high and not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
The European Parliament has voted to approve the Commission's proposal to extend the deadline for the submission of proposals for the adoption of a new directive.
He said a "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, turnout must be over 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major setback in the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses all of Brighton's defence towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling obliterated Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward got a pass in the middle of the field early in the game.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenders before cutting to hit open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He feigned a defense before neutralizing in the race more others on the edge of the greater Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the wide area to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right boot defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he'd play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the early lead in the Premier League clash.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right into Brighton's territory on that play.
He made a pass over the defences along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This one made a few touches before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before it slid out of the boundary of the field.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life difficult for the Rockies .
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer is hopeful of getting on the field Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their division title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can get on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the highest level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under those conditions?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but some say they're inclined to allow Scherzer to pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who was making his 34th start, had a bullpen session on Thursday and would pitch in his normal position on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president referred laterally to the situation surrounding his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones...I'm not running, but I'm running and so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You're watching this horrible, horrible bunch of radical Democrats, you're watching it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they attack, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
"And you've seen that in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, mean, sleazy and liars".
The president referred by name to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and received a loud cheer from the audience.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did it cause the leak?
What?
No, um, no, I, wait, a -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
He is intolerant of those who openly express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
After all, I am the latest in a string of Labour MPs in Parliament who have been told they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday mentioned that "we intend the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in Parliament, the General Committee meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today it is no longer the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of a 'better and gentler' policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever been fulfilled.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy took over as leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political outlook began to expect me to make a turn and take positions I would never agree with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there's a flood of insults on social media calling for "dismissal", denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me I shouldn't belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
I know that I am in fact more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments I receive tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down from them.
One of the things that disappoint me most in this era of politics is how these levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we've become less inclusive, and with every motion of censure or change to the selection rules the party narrows its sights.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years urging me to keep my head down, not be so expressive, and that then "it would be all right" for me.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my sprawling schoolroom literally in ruins, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as mayor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused as to my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that as the country heads for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for Momentum Nottingham; it is for my constituents, Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "dismissal" or political expedients will stop me from acting in what I believe are the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late trials have somehow skewed the outcome, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten undefeated.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team take the lead, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we remain unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The credit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given up for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to put the numbers in play, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a large penalty, before immediately before half-time he scored and then converted a solo try to put the score at 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the deficit to five points.
A long interruption followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the stretcher to the outside and after the restart Ayr bolstered the lead with a try from Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted try from Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure run.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for knocking out Climo without the ball on the penalty kick, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's progressing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately following the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected a box kick from David Armstrong and sent winger Gregor Henry into the home team's fifth practice.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems poised to enter the restaurant business after word spread he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the soon-to-be-released ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, you're a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to get involved in the "flourishing Glasgow restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, landlocked country, hopes the court will reopen a road to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a navy blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty".
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing to once again sail the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest point in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICTY ruling on giant screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of their country's claim, so that after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", were the president's vows last August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if it did.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the ICTY is handed down only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined some residual Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain dialogue after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually swift.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must move beyond the past".
North Korea says there will be no disarmament unless the country trusts the United States .
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has stated that his nation will never give up its nuclear weapons unless it trusts Washington first.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises it made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to think that continued sanctions and US objection to a declaration ending the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps towards disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang has any real intentions to reduce an arsenal that the country views as probably the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on their way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or get complete sun protection, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased on the catwalk a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which stunned the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats, and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide feather-like flap that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-studded watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, although these were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks... just in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled scuba gear, with a tube and glasses, while another looked like a cone of melted ice.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Stylists predict that these huge hats will be on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent in the path of "La Bomba", the two-inch-long straw hat that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that went viral on social media sent another great creation onto the catwalks: a straw beach bag almost as big as the bathing suit model that carried it.
The burnt-orange-colored raffia bag, adorned with raffia stripes and with a white leather grip, was the highlight piece of Jacquemus' 2019 La Riviera spring-summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags hit stores next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional test scores, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With over 30 000 pupils spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the highest level of service for both pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further study and university entry, as well as for their chosen careers and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can reach his heart".
This quote is a good reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
Based on the results of the recent exams this year, we find that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the maximum grade of A.
These data, collected from the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of pupils obtained the maximum A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are promoting foreign languages as vital skills which will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now looked at in the same way as STEM subjects in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that among the reasons for employers' difficulty filling vacancies, 17% related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the younger generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a life skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit proportion, 15%.
So investing now in language education is important for today's children.
The knowledge of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding relevant employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages they teach.
Some will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a language choice in independent schools, supported by specialist teaching staff.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scots.
It must be done.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron starts for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego .
The wait is over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that James will participate in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48, " Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to be ready", he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump's rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump is starting a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of no confidence pending for his choice for the Supreme Court seat, Trump aims to bolster support for the midterm elections soon, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do I watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below in a live YouTube stream.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become strained by sexual abuse allegations.
However, the main purpose of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans, who face a tough election in November, gain some momentum.
So, Trump campaign officials said that these five rallies next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so central to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the hectic campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the early evening rally is expected to draw supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get media coverage from the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is down in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows it has the strength to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three evenly spaced sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of momentum is a totally invented sporting concept, but it's one that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is coming from now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so we're looking at it as a bit of a boost, I'd say", Jordan Spieth said as he left the field late in the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, with four points and 12 more to go.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some spare energy and plenty of reason to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural shouts of celebration grew louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind on two.
His game-winning putt on the 15th produced a similar scream, the kind that reveals he still believes the American team is still in the competition.
"We just need to focus and worry about our own game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but lovely, is four out of four and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only duo not to bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd, it solidifies the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European win at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of Europe's glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, when teamed with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine got the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to getting out of.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give and don't give and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a clear lead after coming off the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday's games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to reach the Le Golf National qualifying, so far, by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, fighting to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, overcame an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two games to spare, but they could not close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's singles on the 12th to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row as he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the second duo to score four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed on the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who was out for two games on Saturday, showed occasional outbursts of genius, but has lost 19 of his fourball and four-ball games, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always have the upper hand.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the men's major, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo scored a brave 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team reversed a four-point deficit before the singles, although Furyk's title-holder team only needs to tie to retain the trophy.
After two days in second place, a counterattack on Sunday seems beyond his possibilities.
North Korea says "not even thinking" about unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were worsening mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we can proceed to our disarmament first".
While Ri recycled well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statements appear significant in that they do not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, in contrast to Pyongyang's previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit held between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, opposing it until the 'declaration of the end of the war'", Ri said.
"The realization that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream for people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the prolongation of sanctions is exacerbating our distrust".
Ri No mentioned plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been mentioned by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the interested party in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this impasse".
Still, Ri's tone of speech was drastically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's rockets toward US soil was inevitable after "Mr. President Mau" Trump called Kim the "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year had threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said much more had to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for such a move, saying that "whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearisation is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in an attempt to strangle funding for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, though North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were seeking were the security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course that teaches them to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has put all of its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the sexist culture of studying in caffeinated "direct courses".
One professor concluded that the students of this world-class university often had no idea about the most basic concepts about self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, authored the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for this course came after I gave a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you only telling me this in senior year?"
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after finding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a dorm where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how poor sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it's not going to change students' behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as we all have a right to know about the health effects of the choice to smoke", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "making direct" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to prevent them from getting fat, since sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year as a freshman at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a campus-wide course, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study programme before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm for bedtime, as well as for waking up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another bout of sadness away from home when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to lose 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox were looking to record their first win of their campaign since a 1-0 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side eventually inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his side eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leaders of the Scottish First Division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the Rangers, lacking in inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now down to sixth, Livingston climbs to third, and just behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And there could be even more trouble for the Rangers after District Attorney Calum Spence received treatment for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor area.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that overtook Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, meanwhile, used the same Livingston's eleven that stole a point from Hearts last week, and he must have been delighted with the way his well-oiled team smothered the opponents on every play.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with what he had.
The team could have scored as early as two minutes when the first pass sent Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to bounce out towards the second bar.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief as to their game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a big penalty at the quarter with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute may have been the opposite of what was expected from the game's development, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone for their tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't handle a long stop ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool as he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the half, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this change almost had an immediate impact as the wing forward passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly sprinted from his line to effect the block.
However, Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long pass after long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held up well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow knocked him out in the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton again claimed a large penalty when he tangled up on Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and counting, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals".
Evans: "Look, now it's really cracking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that gave it its name still lives on.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine trains the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "controls the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involving removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-supporting rant by donning a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump, stating that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he launched a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white guy and he says, 'How can you like Trump?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began with a satire featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the scene of West's bravado was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West when he did it.
Plus, West had complained to the audience that he had a rough time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat".
You bullied me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see the marginalization?" saying, "I'd put on my superman cape, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try love".
His comments drew cheers from the audience and the SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of the show's members telling the paper: "The whole studio was completely silent".
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with his performance of the song I Love It disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received a statement of support from the director of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FACING THE TURBA".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or supporting their 'art') who I believe is embracing and propagating ideologies harmful to the community.
He's free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg once used the name Snoop Lion and of course the now-defunct music legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".

" War of Thrones " star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series, War of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such screen roles often make boys feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Star Wars star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she has a "pretty strong stance" on how to approach the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: What went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grow up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he went on: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time: How can we change this?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people".
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not get into any War of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends next summer, noting that for him, the "battlefields and the horses" are over.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a re-release of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he feels finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here on out", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple tied the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Around 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmission through sexual relations, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that because of the country's conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmission of disease results from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication since 2003 as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaks of information about Republican senators by an associate and attacks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her team published personal information of three U.S. Senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and "far-right" websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters' office and published the data of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak.
This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outrageous", wrote Fleischer.
"That suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they can't get angry.
You can't have a defiant stance.
You can't question the motives of the accuser.
It must reveal calmness and serenity".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who will be running for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the appropriate authorities" to these fraudulent claims.
"We assure you that the culprits will be exposed", he continued, "and will be held legally accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all of my staff".
Johnny English reviews Back to the Fighting - weak spoof of spy film starring Rowan Atkinson
It's now fashionable to look for Brexit connotations in any new film with a British flavour, and that seems to indeed apply to the new edition in the Johnny English comedy and action film series, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and was brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satire about being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his squinting eyes and an overly elastic expression, has got his license to create the confusion renewed a second time - with his name signaling, above all, that this is a comprehensive comic creation for non-English-speaking moviegoers.
He's, of course, the idiot secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a mild glamour, has a little Cloiseau, a little Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the movie "Gloory Moments" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mystery man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for Barclaycard, which left chaos in its wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a chirping sound against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but the humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that editions of "serious" films like 007 and Mission: Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film numbers on the Bean character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the consternation of the duty agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicted figure, already suffering a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best in this role that is reminiscent of the character of Theresa May, but the plot does not give much material for big flights.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once all agents on the asset are compromised, she will have to take someone out of retirement.
And that someone is the clumsy Johnny English, now working as a teacher at a fancy school, but giving informal classes on how to be an undercover spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and reunite with his long-suffering aide Bough, a role once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, a spunky character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of catastrophe in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful, fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurdly clumsy acts: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant, create confusion by infiltrating Volta's luxury yacht as smugglers, and English unleashes sheer anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the stops were certainly made with this last sequence in mind, but as nice and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of kids' TV.
The result is quite mediocre.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that did justice to her talent?
Labour denies that they are crafting a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to give Britons a four-day workweek, but with five days' pay.
Reports suggest the party wants employers to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
Workers would get a three-day weekend, but they would keep their pay.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day workweek won the favorable opinion of the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "We expect to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for the industrial sector".
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day workweek during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this aspiration is not currently favoured by the Labour Party as a whole.
A party spokesman stated: "The four-day workweek is not part of the party policy and we are not considering it".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to take power back from the hands of the "faceless directors" and "speculators" of the basic service companies.
Its plans also include not recovering the entire share of current shareholders in water companies, as the Labour Party will be able to make 'deductions' based on perceived wrongdoing.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create ownership funds that transfer 10% of the shares of private companies to employees, who can pocket annual dividends that can reach up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether or not the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh may make them change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I said, "did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous".
Graham's vote, however, seems to be unwavering.
"I'm adamant about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive indictment would be necessary", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett made a strong denial", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive roster of stars who will be performing on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty from the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to watch acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's true goal: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful ways that contribute to raising awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, how successful has Global Citizen been in these 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clicktivism" - thinking it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has seen more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters that have lobbied to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, the organization says, have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, with at least $10 billion of those commitments already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 lobbying actions in the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced it would fund a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the site, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It's been a long and winding road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US may use navy as a "blockade" to put a brake on Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary", Washington could use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, particularly where it is invited by the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is to try to broker energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe", he said.
And according to the ruler, there are ways and means to stop it.
"The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade them to ensure that energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also stressed that the EU had to be able to take on board the new challenges of the world economy.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels", he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at 11 billion dollars, which aims to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, as it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a leverage tool and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, chief executive of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply consider" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will "think deeply" about running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as top leader", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will thoroughly consider the possibility of running for president".
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
59% of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe Poll.
32% support his candidacy.
The poll revealed a higher support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through since he came back, I can relate to the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds that our soldiers actually come back with", he told an audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and stated that her son and other veterans "come back a little different, come back hardened, come back questioning if there is this respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all other members of the armed forces, have given to the country".
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District sent an amicus curiae brief Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy was not disclosed.
The person claimed that her partner "and her children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
The plaintiff was arrested in Texas.
Public prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Resources Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle", the amicus brief reads.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the police's ban on immigrants negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in a counterclockwise search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense", said Risa Kusuma, 35, a mother of a feverish male baby, as she comforted him at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to salvage anything they could find among their soaked belongings.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured his ribs and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated abroad due to the heavy aftershocks that continued.
Tears streamed down his face as he related how he felt when the violent earthquake struck him in his fifth-floor hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest circulation newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked the beginning of what US officials, speaking to Reuters, called a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides slap waves of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation by running propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said.
"In contrast, in the stands here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that Chinese people may have about their country's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, though he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh's disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many leading Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn that this could spark a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward with a vote.
These things have no going back", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake for an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is at the door!" as they marched in the Senate lobby as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records", Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say she's tall now; it's true.
But it may be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, while disliking the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could occur if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his seat as judge, it's also about how Republicans handled the issue and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority siding with the former.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents believed Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38% said they considered Kavanaugh to have either likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's proposal, the FBI launched an investigation into Ford's claims, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh sexually molested her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two of them were attending a party during the period when they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from this legendary tech personality, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
It allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the underlying intent of Inrupt is to "take over the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse", or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data warehouse is that it is up to the user alone to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to provide the proper resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few in-house programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next Web era", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: a tribute to the clergyman who was awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years on.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann earned the medal on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the event that awarded the medal to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in very thick fog and under close fire from handguns and machine guns".
He then ran into the line of fire and, "with the utmost courage", led the line forward before single-handedly striking a cannon and shooting down three soldiers in the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never match, but also a lesson in humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being shown through the support that will be given by many people".
Mixed martial arts fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 watch Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this: you stay up all night watching Bellator 206, full of stars, and at the end, you're blocked from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the showdown, viewers in the UK were stunned when coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had been up until the wee hours of the morning especially for combat.
A Twitter fan described the shift to children's cartoons as "a sort of tasteless joke".
"Government regulations say that content is not appropriate for six in the morning, so they had to change the schedule", said Dave Schwartz, a marketing and communications administrator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, yeah, you are".
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said the company would revise its broadcast schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we won't be able to solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to fix the problem, but we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise next time it won't happen.
We're gonna reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, like we usually do, and we've tried to exceed the fans' expectations and we've gone too far.
It is a deplorable situation".
Tom Daley felt "inferior" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that it gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he did not realize until he entered high school that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he stated that he spoke out for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The show's longtime regular host, Kirsty Young, took a leave of absence of several months due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
In his words, "to this day, that feeling of being smaller and different has been the real motivation that gave me the power and strength to succeed".
His goal was to prove that he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he came out because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, 20 years her senior, though he has said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much when you're so young" - his first Olympic appearance was at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone his age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last year in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley stated that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all that mattered was 'winning a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the London 2012 games because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that you're not going to be around to be in the front row, Dad", she said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games...there was no better feeling", he said.
All of this was also the inspiration for his first song choice - Proud, by Heather Small - which he had identified with during the Olympics run, and which still gives him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15am BST.
Mickelson down on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back into shape to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record attendance, was benched by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been on the U.S. teams, the five-time major men's champion has split the day between the role of backup and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what's bothering him.
Having never hit the straights even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough usually punishes stray strokes.
And if the field alone wasn't intimidating enough, Mickelson in game nine on Sunday will face defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind in the first 12 singles games, get off to a good start, Mickelson's start could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood my role today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me, and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He's very confident in himself.
He's a respected champion who's given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably didn't expect to see him play two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we should proceed.
He wants to be in the game, like everybody else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched the success of his individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and witty, likes to play with people and is a great person to have in the team room", she explained.
"I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to watch.
He gives so much more than just playing".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear in a flash .
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his lead slipped into the final day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a bumpy ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans, but he crossed the finish line with his nose on the narrowest of margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a narrow margin", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 Team win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over.
Tomorrow, give it your best shot.
Go out there and do it right.
This isn't over until we get the points on the scoreboard.
We have one goal, which is to try to win this trophy and that's where the focus should stay.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who's on the other side: the best players in the world".
Delighted with his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself on that.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow, what matters is individual performance, and that involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the limit.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now you're going to abandon your partner and he has to go and give his best too".
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of these big twists on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ultimately losing when Europe pulled the "Miracle in Medina" out of the bag.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medina.
When that momentum is directed to one side, the pressure is very great in those middle splits.
We've organized our squad accordingly and we've sorted the players the way we feel, you know, we're gonna try to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas, tasked with trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the standings.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the whole route", Bjorn said of his choices for singles.
New German warship once again delayed
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but will have to wait at least until next year due to fault-prone systems and an exponentially rising cost, according to local media.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the newest Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the navy in 2014, but troubling post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signature reduction.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions of up to two years away from their home ports.
But the continued delays have meant that the latest generation of warships, seen as a way for Germany to project power across borders, will be outdated by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put it into service, returning it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the yard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software flaws" that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors, only half the contingent required on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also noted that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to install additional functionalities in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros, an increase from the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems plaguing the newest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships that can be used".
The politician said the problem had grown exponentially over time as older ships were taken out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow fruit bats and bats, as well as long-eared brown beetles and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations throughout the property to track the bats' activities throughout the season.
Mobile surveys will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all the recordings will assess the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affects the dormitories and makes habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, along with flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
It is by using a sophisticated echo-location technique to identify insects and obstacles in its flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of dormitories, and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent bat area", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we have developed here and at other properties will help us to learn more about what they need to flourish".
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance on the property, as the unintentional destruction of just one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their sleeping quarters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved to help.
She was quoted as saying: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are getting back".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the rape allegations against him as "fake news", stating that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid $375,000 to the alleged victim to keep quiet about the accident, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, characterized the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they said today, fake news", the five-time Golden Ball winner told the city hall.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal, you know?
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have characterized as "an unacceptable account of privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would demand compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he raped her annually, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", harmed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims she intends to cancel the agreement as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, but this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100m deal.
Brexit: UK 'would regret it forever' to lose carmakers
The UK would "regret forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU in disorder at the end of March, we will see production stops at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how crossborder transactions work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers claim to be supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have a deal, we want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success but also the opportunity for us to take advantage of this", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points to the fact that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains".
Although it could not give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota stated that in the long run the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could, sooner or later, lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed another week" given that there is still no understanding on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The fact that Trump may be preparing to fire the assistant attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of covertly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday, he moved into the White House, with reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it could be this week but it could also be postponed another week, given everything that has been going on at the Supreme Court.
I always like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists would disagree with such a statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, though he did note that "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism".
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President has more question and answer sessions than any previous president", he said, adding without adding any evidence: "We have looked at those numbers".
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this often and you've seen that we've done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that you can talk to the president of the United States takes the place of any press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences when receiving foreign representatives.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week the president showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre manner before the press.
Health minister writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying for the applications for resident status of EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued throughout the summer, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very unsettling time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate at this time how much I value the contribution of each official, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defensive back Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after sustaining head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers' Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He approached the sideline and practically passed out", Reed reported.
The tech team and medical personnel put Abercrombie on oxygen in the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and transporting him for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, dropped out during his first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which brings his season total to 18 tackles.
Higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK
The Conservative Party announced plans to charge a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers who buy property in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in homelessness relief.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate.
The increase in stamp duty will affect buyers not taxed in the UK
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp duty rate will be charged to foreign buyers who buy property in the UK, with the additional proceeds to be invested in homelessness relief, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate with promises of more affordable housing and taxing higher incomes.
The stamp duty increase will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government's campaign to provide a roof over the homeless.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases - could amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help young people buy their first homes.
She accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding land they don't use, demanding that Mrs May drop quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's 'housing misfortune'.
Mr Corbyn has announced an appealing package of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to evictions "without justification".
It also wants to give municipalities wider powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said I would devote my term of office to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving our housing market problem.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a house for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has become too distant and the shame of sleeping on the rooftop remains too real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot has been successful in the challenge of reviving the north-eastern club, currently third in the Premier League, three points clear of the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish First Division last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalisation", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and those are some of my best memories.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in club management".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio. He was also the manager of the club's reserve team.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear succeeding such established names at such a large club after turning down invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, at the moment success comes down to, 'Can I get the club back to the Premier League?'
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League", he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider myself successful here when I achieve that goal".
Ross's coaching career is just three years old, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts technical staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and led St Mirren from the threat of relegation to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads", he recalls.
"I've always seen myself more as a coach than a player.
It seems weird because it went well, I made a living as a player and I had some high points in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and pressures of the job, but I feel pretty good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I've ever felt in my entire adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave filled British pubs, but it put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Catering groups saw sales grow by 2.7% in July, but restaurant occupancy dropped by 4.8%, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultancy, which compiled the statistics, said: "Continued good weather and England's longer-than-expected run in the World Cup saw the pattern of June, when pubs saw 2.8% growth in sales, repeated in July, but restaurants saw a decline.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with a beverage business fared best, with year-on-year growth more than offsetting the decline in restaurants.
The pubs with a food business also encountered difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the month, with meals down 3%".
Paul Newman of leisure and restaurant industry analyst RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual sales drop of 4.8% is particularly damaging when added to the prolonged cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food-based businessmen, and only time will tell whether the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief".
The growth in total pub and restaurant sales, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral sales indicator for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is recognised as the benchmark for the industry.
One in five children hides secret social media accounts from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret social-networking accounts that he hides from parents and teachers, a study has found
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in "fake" Instagram pages
The news adds to fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social networking accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake" accounts on the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news adds to fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a harmless "main" account to show their parents, while simultaneously having private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that the teenager was inciting others to "rape" her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle to be the 'voice of athletes' at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator's annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for the sport's regulators to draw on her vast experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from her presence on the Board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and hope to be able to make a real contribution to help guide sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is now a regular commentator on the BBC, has lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
As he wrote on Twitter: "One month ago today I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk anymore.
The doctors said only time would tell if and to what extent he would recover.
It's been a lot of hard work, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and I even do some agility exercises now!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Milk pump ad compares mothers to cows, dividing online opinion
A milk pump company has divided online opinions with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is described as "the first portable silent pump for sucking milk", consumer technology company Elvie released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom the new pump gives to sucking mothers.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled cowshed to a song that includes lines like, "Yes, I'm milking, but I don't have a tail" and, "In case you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on, "I'm pumping, pumping, feeding the babies, pumping, pumping, I'm milking my girls".
However, the announcement posted on the company's Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it alleviated the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them within days of their birth", wrote one viewer.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a pumpkin extraction to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity".
Others defended the ad, such as one woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but it makes perfect sense.
This product is brilliant", wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers who pump milk (often in the bathroom or at work) and feel like 'cows.'
It is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who pump milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly inside a breastplate, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies, and even leave the house while they suckle.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women milkers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction while presenting in a fun way that people can relate to the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked down the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski as she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most "godparents" are themselves undocumented immigrants, afraid to compromise their own ability to remain in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective godparents and other adults in their households would be required to have their fingerprints recorded, and the data shared with immigration regulators.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the godparents or their family members are in the country illegally, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals", said Mr Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to shelter officials.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their claim for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to shelter officials and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities like Tornillo's, where the size helps to ignore signs of disturbing children.
They add that transferring children to the camps without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends compounds the trauma many already struggle with.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they "will be treated as such".
'They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,' he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 in a war that has left millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we liberate all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any and all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to stay abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term.
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, impeachment and scandals ended his presidency early.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, prime time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable viewers with up to 3.5 million viewers on big night news.
"This is a strong lure for people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember that time you called a cab in Boston before the 2016 election?
The cabbie told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, immigrants' right to family reunification and the health of the global economy.
Changing the show is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's more than being an informed citizen when we're watching the sixth hour of an expert debate on Bob Woodward's use of "deeply knowledgeable" sources in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as the Washington Post put it), and the implications of Stormy Daniels's scathing descriptions of President Trump's... um... anatomy.
For my part, I'll never face Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's been doing is like a reality show because he gives us something every night", said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily twists and turns of the plot (antagonising with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
We can't miss an episode or we'll fall behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was locked in his house watching MSNBC while he was taping CNN.
I couldn't take my eyes off the television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Significant external funding in the midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is experiencing a funding surge, thanks to a re-alignment of constituencies that left two incumbents in the race for the same seat.
The recent realignment of Pittsburgh's suburban constituencies has put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his seat in another constituency in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps largely with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favored the Republicans.
The race for the 17th Circuit sparked a bitter dispute over campaign funding between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held for more than a decade by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the riding by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have been giving the Democrats a slight advantage.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then backed down.
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little protest from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked the Trump Organization out of the board.
State Department officials decided to recall the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic aid and development, were considered.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, setting aside any and all consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an address to the conference, now set for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study the history
The next bomb to be dropped could be Legal Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will allegedly be directing his investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body as he prepares to re-appear to voters and perhaps be judged by his peers.
There are many possibilities, and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European counterparts.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup, provided the West had resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around tipping points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or halted.
Americans are currently facing several of these tipping points.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president, speculating on his inability to perform the job.
Rosenstein says the Times story is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy is about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she had me light Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, following their impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We approached the game with a positive mindset and scored a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end, but overall, the draw was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we turned around and dominated the second half.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points, it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we'll do our best to get a positive result.
Last year was really tough, with all my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a good atmosphere.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training is going well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past and achieve success".
Women are losing sleep over this retirement savings account.
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they want to receive, few people have spoken to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10 percent mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not having that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family for caregiving if you do not let them know your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial adviser: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing continuing care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary value to help cover these expenses, or financing from your own savings, provided you have those amounts available.
Prepare legal paperwork: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care advocate, choosing someone you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the setting up of a power of attorney over your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for you, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become disabled.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer any questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"It's not just financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who's gonna look after the dog?
Prepare that plan".
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot multiple times with a gas mask as he was returning home after a night on the town.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening and police have requested witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications cut off, rescue workers were unable to get any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The region, with a lower administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities in Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that slammed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hits the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves up to 30 feet [10 m] high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remember the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence investigation and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention Center, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent", the station reported.
Palin is facing three class A felony charges, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
Your girlfriend accused you of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans' associations after associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the Central Sulawesi region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They're circulating videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathering for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
The prosecution is calling for a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City .
The New York State Attorney's Office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare sentence that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented from Home Depot to carry out an October attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, ramming pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries, according to the death penalty notice, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 felony counts, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, normally used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "heinous, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the notice said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the South Side of New York City has asked for the death penalty on a charge.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt fine about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea for life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Backbench Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK "would have left by now" if Farage had been Brexit Minister.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided fellow believers was highlighted by the Remain Conservatives, who organised a separate Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister has struggled to keep her compromise plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insist she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan".
Mr Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left already", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to support Brexit but we should end the Plan".
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he declared: "We did not fight two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country".
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to stay is totally out of place".
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the rally, telling journalists: "I say simply: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the activists who are leading the campaigns on the street and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening".
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Only prime ministers who can keep their promises keep their jobs".
Farage said at the rally that politicians must "feel the pressure" if they are to betray the 2016 referendum decision.
"This has become a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class", he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not going to get away with it".
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilise the people's army of this country which has given us the victory over Brexit and which will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, pro-Remain protesters marched in Birmingham before staging a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists held banners with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology ready for 'Canada more', for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete sham.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he concluded.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" a possible run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There has been speculation that he may face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in a debate format since Trump's inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for President.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington and fix the problems of our government and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrested in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims of the LSU Tigers.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, and subsequently passed away", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was defending a friend and he got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, wielding a gun, admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-3 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games and started 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title with a win over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Coming off pole, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first in the pits and caused Hamilton to have to deal with the traffic at the end of the peloton, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes pitched a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a close skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track clear, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend in turn three.
Max Verstappen came off the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of lap one on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tyres very late, which would allow him to be quick in the final part, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He eventually came into the pits on lap 44 but failed to improve his pace on the final eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me overtake him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the top two positions", said Hamilton.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday over her insistence that she would not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, malicious and deceitful".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate over the last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad and malicious and fake people are", Trump said.
"When you see the leaks and the press releases and when you say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the leak start on you?
Remember her answer-- did she leak the document?
Oh, no, I did not.
The escape did not leave me.'
Well, wait a minute.
The escape started from us... no, it wasn't us", she added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the leak occurred in early September, but denied that the leak had originated in his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's claims, I did not reveal her story", Feinstein told the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request".
But his denial did not convince the President, who remarked during the Saturday night rally: "You know what, that was terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see the evil, the malice, no matter who they can hit, who they have to step on to take power and control", the President said, Mediaite reported.
First Division Dundee Stars defeated Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee .
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from Friday's First Division defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning the second leg 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants got a two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald ensured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, beating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford assisting for Beauvillier to increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frenetic first period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants reached the first interval in the lead, scoring their second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful 27-37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined efforts to help Nielsen take Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game late in the second period, securing the win by scoring the team's fifth goal midway through the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies helping hundreds of passengers flee earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died ensuring a plane with hundreds of passengers safely took off.
More than 800 people have died and many are still missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the town of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post as the control tower shook violently at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained focused on ensuring that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower, facing the impending collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television network ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We were devastated by this news", he added.
However, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster management agency reporting that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The toll is rising as there are many bodies buried under the rubble that we have not yet been able to rescue", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to 20 feet (6 meters) have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are carrying aid and supplies to the scene.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are arriving every minute with bodies.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don't know what we'll find.
The current situation is truly tragic, but it could be much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, according to CNN sources, addressed the military forces there and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
Earlier this year, the Indonesian island of Lombok was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after plane crashes in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that a man is missing after it reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon it could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized Saturday, all of them in stable medical condition.
It is not yet known for certain what caused the crash or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in saying that the plane failed to reach the runway and crashed into the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone off the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, stated that the plane was coming too low.
"It was the best thing that ever happened", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to crawl through the waist-deep water and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors working on an improvement project at a nearby pier also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank 100 feet [30 m] to the bottom.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG registered airlines, but none involving Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the timeline of events the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
You described to the jury how you used the cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of defendant Quintom Tellis, 20, and the victim Jessica Chamber, 19, on the night of her death.
According to the Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several cell phones that confirmed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting statements he had made earlier.
When the data showed that your cell phone was with Chambers at the time you claimed to have been with your friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and stated that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's text messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale declared.
The defense is expected to begin presenting its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to begin with a jury trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip hop has strayed from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to those roots and bring back the popularity of conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing her over "racist" text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was "more of a black woman".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, stating that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some apprehension when she discovered that new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she reported for her first day of work in 2016.
"I can't believe... another black woman", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, upon realizing her gag, an "embarrassed" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, claiming the previous African-American nanny was underperforming and that she was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and seeking a severance package of $350/day for the six-month period she was hired for without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't get away with it", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent you something she didn't really mean.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people", Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you trust your children to someone you've mistreated, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe this".
Calling the process "extortion", Plasco said his wife had only been a mother for two months and had to deal with "a very difficult situation".
"You're going to go after someone like that?
It's not very nice", added the investment banker.
While the legal process is ongoing, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that Paddington's publishers were concerned that readers might not identify with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's so much fun to find out now, after Paddington's been so successful".
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write the children's book, would not have regretted if the book had been rejected, adding that the publication's 60th anniversary had a sour taste given his passing last year.
Of Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", he said that his father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a boastful person", he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we are proud even when the achievement is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Though it was his own imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad would often call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival", said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
- Together.
The medications the doctors had given him to keep his heart functioning were slowly wearing off and leaving his system.
He'd been dead for a while, and all his organs were shutting down.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing all this was going to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold back".
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", he said.
"I always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women post cards on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following their path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting up postcards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to have to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it lit up the room".
However, he gave up the work before he died because he had "dumped into darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found murdered by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion".
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so you know there are people who are available to help and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't shut yourself in. You have to talk".
Kelly Humphreys, longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, very shortly after her mother-in-law died.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed", he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
"On Christmas Day, there was a rag, and when the kids opened the presents, she didn't even look at them".
He said that his death had traumatized them deeply, but it was something they had to get over: "It destroys a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh 's future hangs in the balance as the FBI investigates .
"I thought that by having the same thing I asked for - a time-bound investigation with a defined scope - we could be more united", Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "falling apart" in the face of a deep-seated partisan standoff.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Your reluctance is a matter of mere time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, and on November 6th, if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, their attempts to elect their nominee to the Supreme Court will be thwarted.
George W. Bush has been reaching out to senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently hold seats.
It's not certain that Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaker vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors decline under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1,127 defections last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul has reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the deadlocked denuclearization talks.
The talks followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly, to collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to be the first to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court .
Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader, said that Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied any links to sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a shrill, sobbing voice, as he talked about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee's Democrats, calling the allegations made against him "grotesque and conspiracy-like murder" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court given his biased behavior against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
When asked if she would try to challenge Kavanaugh's actual nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you are not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, not even to serve on your current court", Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she feared Kavanaugh's potential views against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe v. Wade case, given his reputation as a conservative judge.
During confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions about whether he could overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to elect a hysterical, prejudiced person to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision", Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control their emotions.
It's a justified rant, months and years of rage pouring out, and you can't vent it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem like anything strange, does it?"
A woman who was a senior executive at some company helped me a lot. She told me that she cried when she was angry, too, but she had developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off".
And I would.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant", continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly, in a former job in a male-dominated office where I was crying in inexpressible rage, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman -- a not-so-friendly manager who terrified me a little -- and literally dragged up the stairs to hear her say,
"Never let anyone see you cry".
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, a deeply frustrated Patricia Schroeder saw no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Given his late entry, fundraising was below desirable and he vowed he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked himself.
When she announced that she would not be running a formal campaign, emotions came flooding in -- gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many barriers to fundraising and getting the message to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism -- and tears came out.
"I even looked depressed", recalled Patricia Schroeder of the media reaction.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
What would you write on my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The first salvo of the U.S.-China trade war has been deafening, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the two countries' estrangement may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week has seen a significant deterioration in the situation with the new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods shipped from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will falter anytime soon.
To make Washington back down would mean succumbing to the demands, but to show public subservience to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its strengths, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In reality, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated", said Abigail Grace, a research associate in Asian studies at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for refugees to return
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures which have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who remain in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Team beat the USA and won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. now has six straight defeats on European soil since last winning the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is crowned victorious once again after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had shown serious difficulty throughout most of the tournament, threw the starting tee into the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to achieve 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the lowest ranked player on the European Team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the most decorated European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"I'm not in the habit of crying, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I can't thank Thomas enough for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help", said Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel in beating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual stats from one of the greatest players of all time with 14 major titles to his name, beaten only by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the rest of the U.S. team struggled to get to the fairway.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them.
This morning, we can get some fear into Europe.
We fought.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players were excellent.
We're gonna reorganize and I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee to move us forward.
I like a lot of these 12 players and I'm proud to be their captain.
I gotta take my hat off to the other team.
They were better".
Red tide updates: concentrations are decreasing in pinellas, manatee and sarasota.
According to new information from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there has been a decrease in Red Tide concentrations in some areas of Tampa Bay.
The FWC reported that conditions of lower stain proliferation were identified in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Tide blot stretches about 120 miles along the coast from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer areas than last week.
Red tide was also spotted in Pasco County.
Over the past week, there have been average concentrations along or off the coast of Pinella County, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, low to high concentrations in Manatee County, low to high concentrations along or off the coast of Sarasota County, low to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, low to high concentrations along or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Over the past week, there have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwest region of Florida.
