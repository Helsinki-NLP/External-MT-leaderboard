Rapidly spreading cluster outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing prevalence of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Economic Area/European Union, and the UK confirms that while in different countries, we are at different stages of the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, other countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase their preparedness to cope with the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care and intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
At that time, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a chronic disease, a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% experience a critical condition requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for patients in the hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of the increasing coronavirus prevalence in each of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and compare them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, with the number in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread in more geographical areas, and the dynamics of the pandemic in the rest of the world are now following this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the World Health Organization in the journal Eurosurveillance on 5 March 2020.
In the EU/EEA, three cases confirmed by France were reported on 24 January 2020 from people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were identified in all 30 European/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 confirmed cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December 2019 to that date, compared to 17,750 confirmed cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone.
Getting the cumulative number and prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), COVID-19 cases in countries around the world are only reported from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization, which are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the COVID-19 trend in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare it with the disease trend in Italy.
As an indicator for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative truncated prevalence of COVID-19 cases over a 14-day period, thus taking into account the natural COVID-19 period in EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative number of reported cases from each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. was also compared with the reported cases of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The 14-day cumulative outbreak trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK is generally followed by Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative COVID-19 outbreak began to rise around 21 February and then rose sharply around 28 February 2020 (additional claim).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar upward trends in the cumulative spread of COVID-19 (additional study).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the number of cases in Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
This figure shows that at 8am on 15 March, the total number of cases reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK is comparable to the number of cases in Italy 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results suggest that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trend in the cumulative outbreak of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is currently progressing at approximately the same rate in all countries.
While countries are at different stages of the disease, public health organizations are responding differently, and there are likely to be different definitions and protocols in countries for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including increasing the speed of testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the virus-affected areas of Italy described a situation where about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had reached maximum capacity.
Data on admission to hospital or intensive care unit for COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
To complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths, this information should be collected in a systematic manner.
A study conducted between 2010-11 found that access to intensive care and intermediate care beds varies widely in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010)
Modelling scenarios for healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for various EU/EEA countries and the UK for the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with more than 90% of intensive care unit bed capacity occupancy, are presented in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
Since cases are classified in specific regions of the European/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a region, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be available in the list of territorial units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the ongoing trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEA and the UK is progressing rapidly.
Hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care, as is occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, preventive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2 is required, with a rapid shift from containment to mitigation, as the prediction of a rapid increase in the number of cases if not done very early may leave decision-makers and hospitals with insufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response based on this trend.
A rapid risk assessment lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is little time left for countries to increase their control measures to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the healthcare sector.
Failure to do so will likely lead to the healthcare system of other EU/EEA countries facing a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the days or weeks ahead.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and 80,000 infections in China and other parts of the world, which is a catastrophe for humanity.
SARS-CoV-2, like its cousin SARS, which caused thousands of deaths in 2003, may have been transmitted from bats and may cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more transmissible and affects older people more than young and men more than women.
This article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly expanding research topic in response to the large amount of published material on this emerging disease.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, causation, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay at home for the entire holiday and for several weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus.
It is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
It started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.
The World Health Organization warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on 7 January 2020, in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published, including virology, epidemiology, causation, diagnosis, and treatment, which have identified the sequence of the virus isolated from several patients.
In this review, we attempt to summarize the progress of research in this new and rapidly developing field.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other infectious diseases caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, discovered in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and treatment, as well as some other pressing questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, leading to about 15% of common colds in the mainstream4.
But in this century, we've encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with horrific rates of infection and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan to the Chinese National Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On 15 January 2020, the first death from Wuhan was reported.
At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On 20 January, a healthcare staff epidemic was reported, showing that human-to-human transmission is possible.
On 23 January, residents of Wuhan were placed under home quarantine and public transportation was halted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the origin of infection from an unknown animal source.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency on 30 January.
At the time of writing, the disease has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the ultimate extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
As of 11 February 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases shows an updated picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People with SARS-CoV-2 are of different ages, but mostly between 30 and 65 years.
Almost half of those infected (47.7%) were over 50 years of age, a very small number were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
More people with SARS-CoV-2 are male (0.31/100,000) than female (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in clusters, mainly in and around Hubei.
The median time from onset to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2 to 9 days).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The mean period from onset to death was 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The baseline serum R0 was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people with the disease rose exponentially before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the peak travel times before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (over 60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, coiled viruses that contain a single strand of sensory RNA.
These viruses can be divided into four classes alpha, beta, gamma and delta, which have been identified as the alpha and beta types of coronaviruses that can infect humans.
The enveloped spike glycoprotein (S) binds to the host cell's angiotensin, causing the conversion of enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, followed by membrane fusion.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA forms virion-containing sacs with glycoprotein envelopes and nucleocopsid proteins, which then attach to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
With a genetic match of more than 99/98% of 10 sequence samples collected from the main outbreak site, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through transient electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultra-thin layered tissue of the human airway.
It was found that human ACE2 acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein from SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes fewer infections than SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a latent protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis by inhibiting IFNβ. However, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported a full-length human ACE2 related cryo-EM structure with a resolution of 2.9 angstroms in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the compound, which had open and closed configurations, was synthesized as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 synthesis could bind two S proteins, which could be evidence for identifying CoV and infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have both been found to have originated from bats and transmitted to humans via cats and camels, respectively.
Through comparison of the phylogenetics of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were found to be the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs, SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21 of bats.
However, the question of which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unanswered, and the route of transmission still needs further clarification.
G and colleagues believe that snakes, which contain a homologous compound within the S protein, acted as carriers of the virus from bats to humans.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, based on 99% genetic similarity in the CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2, stated that eating pangolins - a type of long-snouted ant-eater often used in traditional Chinese medicine - may have acted as a potential SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host.
However, the 1% difference spread across two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, we are still waiting for definitive results for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a dry environment for up to 48 hours and in a laboratory environment at 20 °C and humidity of 40 to 50% for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and 56°C for 30 minutes, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, prastic acid, chloroform and other non-chlorhexidine fatty solvents, which can effectively inactivate the virus.
The general population is not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
No detailed study of the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported at this time.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after virus has invaded the host cell, virus recognition is initially performed by the host's innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
The virus, through various pathways, induces the emergence of inflammatory agents, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of interferon-type (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophages of phagocytes in the virus antigen.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape the immune system.
The adaptive immune system is very early in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
The humoral immunity includes complementary antibodies such as C3a and C5a and are also essential in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system causes the production of large numbers of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, characterized by its cluster emergence, mostly affects elderly people with underlying diseases and pregnant women.
It is common that people who have been exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune system is weak are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on a study of 425 first cases in Wuhan, the mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 14 to 14 days, but in most cases it is 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days, with a range of zero to 24 days.
A more recent study shows, as explained above, a gestation period of 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days) based on a statistic of 8,866 cases.
This is critical for health authorities to determine the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected people who are asymptomatic to others.
A common approach is that people exposed to or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is the primary symptom of COVID-19 in most cases, and can be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced breathlessness or a decrease in oxygen in their tissues within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease rapidly progresses to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification, and blood clotting disorders.
Patients with fever or severe respiratory symptoms and fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities on radiological images, should be screened for early detection of the virus.
A population study in late December 2019 showed that 98% of patients had symptoms of: fever, 76% of patients had a dry cough, 55% had shortness of breath, and 3% had diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilators.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a familial cluster and a cluster resulting from transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
A 2012 population study also found that in patients with MERS-CoV, fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) were the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required ventilator support, which is much more than COVID-19 patients, indicating that MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99 to 100 percent), dry cough (29 to 75 percent), shortness of breath (40 to 42 percent), diarrhoea (20 to 25 percent) and sore throat (13 to 25 percent) were the main symptoms, and about 20 to 14 percent of patients required ventilators.
By February 14, when the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576, the COVID-19 death rate was around 2 percent.
In comparison, the SARS mortality rate was about 10 percent of the 8,096 confirmed cases by November 2002.
A population study in June 2012 calculated the mortality rate for MERS at 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study before this one showed that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was about 5.71 to 7.23, whereas the R0 range for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is provided in Table 1.1.
The above images show that SARS-CoV-2 is more virulent than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less virulent than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Consequently, the control of SARS-CoV-2 is much more difficult than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster starts often occur in a family or from a gathering place or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Often, patients have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other infected areas or contact with infected people or patients two weeks before the onset of illness.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without having symptoms, and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital can also transmit the virus again, which is a warning for the extension of quarantine time.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or low.
For example, lymphophonia with a white blood cell count of less than 4×109/L included a lymphocyte count of less than 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels, and the presence of virus in the blood was seen in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood were elevated in some patients, and C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposition were elevated in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer D, which is produced by the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased gradually.
The abnormality seen in chest X-rays is seen in most COVID-19 patients and is characterized by bilateral shadows or a matte glass curvature in the lungs.
In most patients, abnormal pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develop.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and advanced fibrosis severely impair the air exchange of the individual.
Type I and II dysfunction in the pneumocytes leads to decreased surfactant levels and increased surface tension, resulting in a decreased ability of the lungs to expand and an increased risk of lung failure.
So the worse the chest X-ray findings, the more severe the disease spread.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed that the peeling of pneumocytes, formation of vitreous membranes, and infiltration of interacute lymphocytes and squamous sinusae cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease were consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS, and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 related RNA was used as the primary diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 by reverse polymerase-rRNA sequence reaction (RT-PCR).
However, due to the high false negative rate of this method, which may accelerate the epidemic, the use of clinical signs (no longer relying on RT-PCR alone) to diagnose the disease began in China on 13 February 2020.
The same thing happened with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is necessary to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group proposed a protocol using CRISPR-based Sherlock methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which detects SARS-CoV-2-related RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter of input cases) using a tape in less than an hour without the need for expensive precision instruments.
It is hoped that the new method, if validated in clinical trials, could dramatically increase the accuracy and convenience of the test.
Due to the lack of experience with this novel CoV, physicians can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while various therapies have been proposed to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially, and may have weaker attacks on other ACE2-positive organs, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure is the most important risk in the patient population and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is critical to alleviate symptoms and save a person's life, which can include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilators, and invasive mechanical ventilators, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock and protecting vital organ function is also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine floods have been found to result from an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
This cytokine induces immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immune suppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with chronic conditions.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other treatments for immune system suppression to prevent cytokine storm include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blenatomb; cytokine signaling inhibitor 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids were widely used as immune suppressant drugs in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids were not helpful in severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause severe side effects, especially vascular osteochondrosis, and dramatically impact recovery.
However, short-term corticosteroid use in low to moderate doses is recommended with caution for COVID-19 patients in critical condition.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been approved for this disease.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir was shown to be able to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Accordingly, Gilead has sent the compound to China for a series of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, with very promising results.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
Taking blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to use it to help treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, patients who recover often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood to fight off the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign substances and detect and directly neutralize unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was obtained from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral load and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, before any specific treatments can be offered, the large-scale use of this method requires validation and clarification.
In addition, some plasma-related adverse effects should be carefully considered in terms of therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat patients is very high.
It is difficult to rapidly develop and produce specific antibodies that are sufficient to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic codes encoding antibodies or screening effective antibodies against the virus's parent proteins is more important and useful.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies very quickly.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of different components in the formula, which varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Most of its active ingredients are still unknown or obscure, because it is difficult to extract and confirm these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become an important treatment option for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe episodes due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, the capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest cure rates for COVID-19 patients were observed in several Chinese provinces where TCM was used for 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%). The lowest treatment rate (13%), was observed in Hubei Province where only 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM.
However, this comparison is not entirely accurate, as many factors such as the number and severity of patients must be considered in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) alone and combined WM and TCM.
They found that the time required to recover body temperature, symptom resolution and hospitalization in the group treated with WM+TCM was significantly shorter than the group treated with WM only.
Surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still awaiting better controlled trials at larger scales and more centers.
Also, determining the mechanism of action and identifying the effective components of the TCM treatment or their compounds if possible, is a topic that has aroused the curiosity of scientists.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often have a high fear of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined individuals also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough, and side effects of treatment such as insomnia from corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric complications including severe depression, anxiety, nervous breakdowns, psycho-motor excitations, psychotic symptoms, delusions and even suicide were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health system's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma among their family and friends.
Therefore, psychiatric care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, contacts, and the general public in need.
Mental health should include the creation of mental health teams from different disciplines, transparent communication with regular and thorough updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are necessary to cut the chain of transmission from infected animal and human populations to susceptible hosts and are often used as a complementary method to antiviral therapy in the control of infectious diseases caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on the S protein to produce strong and long-lasting inhibition or immunity antibodies against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in elderly and hard-to-treat models and their protection against human-animal viral co-infections needs to be determined before clinical trials can begin.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, MERS cases and clusters are still seen in the Middle East and are spreading to other areas due to the presence of animal-to-human transmission sources in indigenous areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been proposed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, paraviral particles, and neocompatible protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Producing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for unvaccinated people is a critical and necessary task for controlling the epidemic.
However, this problem is difficult to overcome due to the long time required to produce a vaccine (on average 18 months) and the dynamic variations of the different strains of CoV.
COVID-19 as a new disease has just begun to show a full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with high complications and mortality in patients with acute cases.
Therefore, developing a disease flow prediction model is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited facilities.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may influence the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important predictor of SARS, as was COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly in people aged 30-65; in a study of 8,866 patients, 47.4% were over 50 years of age.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying complications and abnormalities and were older than those who did not require intensive care (median age of the first group was 66 and the median age of the second group was 51 years). This suggests that age is a predictor of disease course and outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Previous illness and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, leading to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly interrelated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein levels in blood indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been suggested as a potential factor for disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
A correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 disease has also been suggested.
In addition to this, elevations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released as a result of tissue damage.
Hence, as traditional symptoms of heart or liver disorders.
Primary clinical symptoms: To predict outcomes and complications of COVID-19, chest radiography and timing of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immune suppressants that are commonly used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury.
Because high-dose corticosteroids were widely used in patients with SARS, many people who recovered from vascular osteochondrosis suffered lifelong disability and reduced quality of life.
Steroids should therefore be used in low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients if necessary.
Psychological stress: As explained above, since the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered from extreme stress, often due to prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and have witnessed the death of close family members and their patient roommates.
Providing counseling and long-term support is essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the demographic studies conducted so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from those of SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 in addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract can replicate effectively in the upper respiratory tract and at the initial stage of infection, symptoms are mild or minor, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients with the first stage or the dormant period can produce large amounts of viruses during their daily activities, which can make it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission occurred when patients were severely ill and did not occur in the early stages of the disease.
Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe than the SARS outbreak and is more difficult to control.
There are many efforts underway in China, including the ban on house-to-house movement in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of breaking the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have severely affected the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the disease.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the virus will continue its downward trend for 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be fundamentally more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and believe that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs and throat swabs from patients who had been discharged from hospital two weeks earlier and had recovered, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be transformed into a cyclic disease similar to influenza.
However, there have been promising signs in China based on a decrease in new cases, suggesting that current strategies may be working.
It was originally projected that Ebola would cause one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will become less pathogenic and eventually disappear or become a low pathogenic virus that lives in close proximity to humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through cough or sneezing and is likely to be transmitted to the virus through direct contact with infected material.
The virus has also been found in faeces, which allows transmission from faeces to the mouth.
A new study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were due to hospital infections, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare workers.
Therefore, great care should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passersby who are in contact with patients or those with the disease.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks, both through the use of surgical masks and N95 respirators (series 1860), which help control the spread of viruses.
A surgical mask prevents the droplets of fluid dispersed by potentially infected individuals from passing through the air or sticking to the surface of the material where they can be passed to others.
However, only N95 masks (series, 1860) can protect a person from inhaling viral particles as small as 10 to 80 nanometers, and only 5% of viral particles can pass through completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, both being approximately 85 nanometers.
Since particles can pass through up to five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, healthcare professionals who are in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series 1860), not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear isolation vests to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 by wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent shields and glasses when working with patients.
For the general public in areas that are or potentially contaminated, it is highly recommended that people wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more than usual and try to stay home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet (one meter) is considered the most appropriate distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the virus from spreading.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to humans as a new virus, its high similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, based on the deep recollection of the 2003 SARS outbreak, was a significant warning for China.
However, until 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control was reassuring the public by saying that the new virus is low in contagiousness, limited in human-to-human transmission, and that there is no problem in preventing or containing the disease.
This message significantly reduced the risk awareness among the general public, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the critical time was lost to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
The disease control agencies in China may have learned the hard way and will make major improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more vigilant, considering that every word spoken by health organizations matters to citizens and can change people's attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information received from clinicians and authorities, rather than waiting for official reports; (3) instead of trying to deter people, take more restrictive measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages; and (4) issue targeted and effective response orders frequently, in order to raise public awareness of pandemics and improve the testing system for the community over time.
The COVID-19 outbreak was initiated by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus in late December 2019.
In less than two months at the time of writing, the virus has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries globally.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are similarities between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of SARS returning.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are essential to know in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people, and men more than women, and its severity and mortality are higher in older people than in younger people.
The lethality of SARS was higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, while patients with SARS disease transmit the virus when they become severely ill, making COVID-19 more difficult to contain than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread more widely than SARS-CoV.
Normal RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can be re-infected with the virus and test positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain unresolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is about 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs in bats, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
Which animal, as the intermediary, transmitted the virus from the original host, the bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop transmission and the outbreak could return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical measurements have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent disease-dependent mutations?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the outbreak last?
How does the virus mutate genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or come back periodically like influenza?
The answers to the above questions are important, but it may take some time to get to the answers to the above questions and many others.
However, at whatever cost it may be necessary, we have no choice but to stop this pandemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Animal origin of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, adaptation has allowed the simultaneous evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human co-viruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as the common cold.
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown how devastating and dangerous HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought CoVs back into the spotlight and surprised us with their high carcinogenicity, but with fewer symptoms compared to their sibling SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a human-animal disease type and knowing the animal origin of HCoVs helps us well.
The source of most HCoVs are bats, which do not cause disease in their bodies.
Hosts that act as intermediate reservoirs of some HCoVs have also been identified.
The identification of animal hosts has a direct impact on the prevention of disease in humans.
Examination of CoV host interactions in animals could also yield important insights into CoV pathogenicity in humans.
In this review, we provide a review of the current knowledge on seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
An important topic to consider is comparing different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genetic recombination.
The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Furthermore, the need for successful host change and viral evolution for disease severity is explored in this article.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped, single-stranded RNA-positive polarity viruses.
These viruses, which have the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobytes among RNA viruses, were called "CoVs", because of their crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have a single genome that shares a similar structure.
Approximately two thirds of the genome consists of two large recombination reads (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are converted to the polyprotein replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyprotein undergoes further processing, resulting in the production of 16 non-structural proteins, which are designated nsp1 through 16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs, which are used for structural proteins such as spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleopronin (N).
A number of ancestor-specific secondary proteins have been encoded by different CoV ancestors.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genus comprises most HCoVs and is further divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have continuously overcome species barriers and some have emerged as important pathogens for humans.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63R alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL6 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds or diarrhea.
In contrast, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and the new SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections in most patients and are likely to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and exopathological symptoms.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, we have gained more knowledge through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, it was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003, one of the most devastating outbreaks of modern times, infected more than 8,000 people and had a crude fatality rate of almost 10 percent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused a pandemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to other parts of the world.
In 2019, the new HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, caused the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, which killed over 3,120 people and infected over 91,000 as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is going off and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have an animal origin, including bats, mice, or pets.
There is ample evidence that all HCoVs have an evolutionary origin in bats, where viruses are well adapted and present without disease and show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the animal origin of disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving factors, and limiting factors of species mutation.
It may also facilitate the search for reservoirs, intermediate hosts and animal hosts that enhance SARS-CoV-2 and have important implications for preventing future pandemics.
In this review, we will review the animal origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the commonality that HCoVs are not normally pathogenic in their natural habitat, but become pathogenic after translocation to a new host.
We also examine the evolutionary pattern of HCoVs, where increased viral transmission is often associated with decreased pathogenicity.
The implications of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have also been discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known to us since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in various animal species including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) can be informative and useful.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E sequence was sampled from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections, and subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell culture.
Patients with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, diarrhea, weakness, sore throat, and fever and cough in 10-20% of them.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture in the laboratory and gradually entered the brains of small mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those of HCoV-229E, which are not detectable in terms of symptoms of other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229 and HCoV-43 are both globally distributed and are transmitted mainly during winter in temperate climates.
Generally, the latency time of these two viruses is less than a week, and after that, the illness lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to studies conducted on human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild colds.
Severe lower respiratory tract infections were observed in only a few patients with immunodeficiency.
SARS, also known as "peck-shaped pneumonia", was the first pandemic in human history caused by SARS-CoV and the third HCoV discovered.
The first SARS case can be traced back to late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
The SARS outbreak infected 8,096 people and killed 774 people, and spread to many countries and continents.
Except in extreme cases, it is estimated that each case can infect approximately two others, with a latency period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load appearing on day 10 of illness.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle aches, headaches, fever, weakness, and tremors, followed by shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver function test failure and increased serotonin kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Extensive alveolar degeneration, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage increase have also been observed in SARS patients.
Subsequently, about 20 to 30 percent of patients required intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney were affected in acute cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that could be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first sampled during open-lung biopsy of a relative of the flagship patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been many attempts to investigate HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially identified as common in young children, elderly patients, and immunocompromised individuals with common respiratory illnesses.
Cold, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common in HCoV-NL63 disease.
In another independent study, isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands was described.
Although the virus was detected in the Netherlands, it actually spread globally.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of chronic respiratory diseases, with peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with inflammation of the laryngeal occlusion, also known as Crohn's disease.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide and causes mild respiratory illnesses.
These four community-transmitted families have adapted well to humans and are generally less susceptible to severe disease, although cases occur for unknown reasons, such as in the rare case recently reported, the malignant HCoV-NL63 that caused lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and persist in humans, the severity of virulence or pathogenicity decreases.
MERS-CoV was isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory confirmed cases of the virus originate from the Middle East, imported cases with secondary transmission due to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak was confirmed in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases.
The clinical onset of MERS is similar to that of SARS, which is known to be preceded by acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is specific to MERS among HCoV-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with infectious diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared a global public health emergency over the outbreak of respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 and called the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide was 90,053, with a crude fatality rate of 3.4 percent.
Notably, the death rate in Hubei China was 4.2% while it was 1.2% outside of it.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causes severe respiratory infections, which are seen in the form of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to an 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they are clustered into different branches on the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but has a higher transmissibility.
Some reportedly infected people with SARS-CoV-2 did not have any symptoms, which could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal significant similarities and differences.
The first is that the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is the median of SARS-CoV and the four community-transmitted HCoVs (namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics commonly seen in community-transmitted HCoV infections, including nonspecific, mild or even asymptomatic in some cases.
On the other hand, a small subset of acute COVID-19 cases can also be seen in SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission exhibits interesting patterns of community-transmitted HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as transmissible as community-transmitted HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after multiple human-to-human transmissions, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
Whether fecal or urinary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in transmission, as does SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, should be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonal, as in community-transmitted HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after transmission from person to person will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-transmitted HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well-adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it may be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that caused severe disease in humans and humans that were infected with severe HCoV disease are now extinct.
To do this, HCoVs must replicate in humans sufficiently to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the host limiting factors.
In this case, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people are infected, the greater the chance of the virus becoming fully adapted to humans.
If it is well-adapted, it will be difficult to prevent transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human communities, causing the common cold in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruses do not require an animal source.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
These viruses need to be preserved and propagated in their animal reservoirs and are prone to seek opportunities to infect human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and four community-derived HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, at least for the time being, as are community-transmitted HCoVs.
However, its pathogenicity is lower than community-transmitted HCoVs and higher than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether the virus will fully adapt to humans and be transmitted between humans without an intermediate reservoir or animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoirs, intermediate hosts and replicator hosts of HCoVs.
If the host animal is a close viral ancestor with high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence, that animal acts as an evolutionary host for the HCoV.
An ancestral virus is usually well adapted to the host and is not pathogenic to it.
Similarly, a reservoir host provides a permanent and long-term shelter for HCoVs.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and the natural host is either HCoV or its parent viruses.
In contrast, if HCoVs have an intermediate host before infecting humans, or at approximately the same time, they are not well adapted to the new host and are often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a reservoir of human infection, and in the role of replicator host, increase the level of infection in humans by providing the possibility of temporary replication of the virus and then its transmission to humans.
If HCoVs cannot sustain transmission in a median host, they can cause deadly infections.
Conversely, HCoVs can adapt to the intermediate host and even persist in the host population for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host acts as a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data indicate that the first person infected with SARS was in contact with predatory animals.
Subsequent studies of the serological outbreak show that the level of anti-SARS immunoglobulin G is higher in animal products sellers than in the general population.
A number of masked pine beetles (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog were first identified in the live animal market as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that were nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
A 29-nucleotide deletion trait for SARS-CoV has been found in strains taken at the onset of the human epidemic.
However, it has been reported that masked palm fronds inhabiting forests or farms that were not marketed as live animals were mostly negative for the presence of SARS-CoV. This suggests that masked palm fronds are likely to be only intermediate and replicating hosts, not natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that 80% of the various animals on the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so the possibility that several species of small mammals may also act as intermediate booster hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these appear to be the end hosts of SARS-CoV.
A further search for a natural animal host SARS-CoV, a type of coronavirus closely related to the bat CoV called SARS-related bat coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), was found living in a Chinese bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This virus and other bat CoVs have 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV.
These studies have provided the basis for a new theory that bats are the hosts of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) were also identified in bats, but apart from WIV1, none were isolated as live viruses.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1, which was derived from bat feces, showed that ACE2 from bats, bats, and humans is used as a receptor for entry into cells.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS-recovering patients had the ability to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has been the closest SARS-CoV ancestor in bats, with 95% nucleonid sequence similarity.
Although there are many similarities between the two types of virus, it is generally believed that the WIV1 virus is the direct parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not direct reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV with similar groups such as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a similar host receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are more closely related phylogenetically to the bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, are only 87% similar in their nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats cannot be the immediate reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels from a mountain goat are positive for MERS-CoV-specific inhibitory antibodies, and this is also true for camels from the Middle East that live in the African country.
Live MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was sampled from the nose of a camel in a mountain and showed that camels are the true reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that generally mild symptoms and very high viral loosening were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus excretion in bats.
However, one question that has remained unanswered since then is that in many confirmed cases of MERS, there was no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which is likely to be attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unknown animal species.
SARS-CoV-2 has about 96.2% nucleotide sequence similarity to the bat-isolated RaTG13 bat-CoV.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is excellent for determining parental relationship.
In other words, bats cannot be direct reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2 unless similar bat CoVs are found in the future.
Presumably, the animal intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, in which many early COVID-19 cases were found, would be wild animals sold and killed at the Hunan Seafood Market, suggesting possible animal-to-human transmission of the virus.
Recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also harbor ancestral beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new genome of the pangolin CoV has about 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
However, these viruses are equally associated with RaTG13 with approximately 90% nucleotide sequence similarity.
These viruses are clustered into two sub-clusters of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a similar receptor binding domain to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% identical amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more different, albeit with a higher degree of sequence similarity across the genome.
A previous study in infected pangolins reported that fragments of viral DNA associated with SARS-CoV-2 were isolated from lung samples.
The study used various sequencing and manual editing techniques to create a portion of the gene volume that was about 86.3% of the length of the viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the animal intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originated in pangolins, as there is a divergence between the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin-related beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is still unknown.
While the highest sequence similarity in RBDs was observed between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoVs related to beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genomic similarity.
The high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be due to convergent evolution by selective means.
A different proposal advocates recombining SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs with pangolin and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is common among beta-CoVs.
The judgments on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet complete.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are still being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229 may have derived from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
A bat CoV called .ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in North American trilobites has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 discovered in Ghana, while the perfected is also suspected as the intermediate host of this virus.
For clarity, the current knowledge on the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for the interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 found its way between different animal species to infect humans through feces, it triggered a respiratory infection pandemic.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not well known.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among them is an alpha-alpaca CoV.
Multiple lines of evidence support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may interact with bats in a shared ecological environment.
Instead, humans are closely related to the alcapas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are heterogeneous and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoVs cause respiratory disease in animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wildlife.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas may have received HCoV-229E-associated alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the H. pylori virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and H. pylori virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alpha-CoVs act as the HCoV-229E gene store, alpacas and mountain camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as seen in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of interspecies transmission from bats to mountain camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was evident from the very beginning of the virus's identification, and subsequent findings reinforced this theory.
It is clear that bats provide a rich reservoir of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, crowded colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all conditions for bats that make them ideal virus carriers.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been entering mountain camels for several decades.
It has adapted well to these camels, and this camel has evolved from a median host to a stable and natural host.
MERS-CoVs cause very mild disease and have relatively low mutation rates in these animals.
Occasional transmission to humans is a random event, and humans are the host of MERS-CoV, as transmission cannot be sustained.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
These animals may be the host of the beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2, similar to the sibutramine in SARS-CoV.
There are several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans that should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can host a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may have shared an ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolin could be one of the intermediate reinforcing hosts where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently entered.
Humans are infected with the virus through butchering and eating game.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The study of domestic and wild animals is necessary for immunology.
Third, as discussed above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Besides the different animal host types, three other factors from the virus side are also important for facilitating the passage of CoVs through the existing barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
The estimated mutation rate in the CoV, with an average replacement rate, is equivalent to approximately 10-4 replacements per year per site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to the new host, which can be considered medium to high compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses.
CoVs have an error-correcting exoribonuclease that can lead to very high mutation, mortality or even inactivity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir inhibits the replication of CoV by inhibiting both this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerases.
Remdesivir is one of the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is about one million times that of their hosts.
Moreover, mutation rates are high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to the high mutation rate of SARS-CoV, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, the virus has already adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is true for MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the camel of a mountain.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic modification could rapidly render vaccines and antivirals ineffective against SARS-CoV-2.
The second large RNA genome in CoVs allows for excess flexibility in genome editing for genetic and recombinant mutations, thereby increasing the potential for cross-species mutation, which under the right conditions, contributes to the emergence of new CoVs.
This is supported by the large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions that are encoded towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and repeatedly change motifs during RNA replication through a unique "copy-selection" mechanism.
In the host, which acts as the mixing reservoir, strand substitution occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Long, fully homologous, subgenomic RNAs can recombine to produce new CoVs.
In both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat-CoV and bat-CoV-HKU9, phylogenetic evidence for natural recombination has been found.
Viral-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral agents mentioned above, interaction of the virus with the host host is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV neutropen is considered a typical example, showing evidence of positive selection during an interspecies transmission event.
Based on a comparative analysis of isolated human and SARS-CoV cohorts, SARS-CoV is thought to have rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD in the S protein of the CoV virus interacts with the cellular receptor and elicits a strong antibody response in the host.
In SARS-CoV, it is located on amino acid 318 to 510 and on the fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 and co-admissive receptors.
SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals including bats, seals, mice, and raccoon dogs, allowing for interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to differ from viral samples from humans and mice in RBD, and 4 of them are in the binding-receptor motif to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
- SARS CoV Siut has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD that may increase the tendency of the spike protein to interact with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that the propensity to bind the S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows that there is a 10 to 20-fold propensity for this link between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another common receptor is required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of the S-terminus.
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also explain the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans following translocation between animal host species.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host-dependent and limiting factors.
The heterogeneity of host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs such as bats, mountain camels and rodents may create a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, HCoVs must control host-dependent factors and eliminate host-limiting factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction should be identified and identified.
Fully neutral genome-wide screening of host dependence and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be fruitful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: from scratch
Bat CoV variants have provided ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoVs act as gene storage for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also promote the evolutionary path of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically change viral phenotypes.
Of the side proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in human adaptation, as it was found to encode different ORF8 proteins after the isolation of the bat virus associated with SARS-CoV.
The nucleotide-29 deletion feature of SARS-CoV has been observed in isolated strains at the onset of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that contributes to host change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible nucleocomplex history with the ancestors of alpha and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller nucleocomplex domains were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Neocat sites were identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic has experienced inter-species neocombination events that occurred in the Arabian monk camel.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a recombination event has been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs are combined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely caused by the escape of viruses from selective pressure exerted, for example, by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 with full length in the HCoV-229E proto-species due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
Although complete ORF4 intact can be seen in related viruses with HCoV-229E bats and camels, alpha-CoV alpaca with an additional nucleotide leads to a frame change.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
No or mild symptoms were detected when the bats were infected with CoVs, indicating cross-compatibility between CoV and bat.
Bats appear to be anatomically and physiologically well adapted to the CoVs.
For example, a defect in the activation of the pre-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the damage caused by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the rearrangement of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitory killer cell receptor and low levels of tissue compatibility of large complex class I molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from high metabolic activity in bats can both inhibit CoV replication and affect the reversibility of exoribonuclease effect, thereby providing selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic strains of the virus once it enters a new host.
CoV strains that are more pathogenic may be able to undergo recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
So, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in host hosts such as bats and camels.
These viruses multiply vigorously without encountering a strong immune response from the host.
There are mysteries here about why asymptomatic pregnancies occur and what causes severe conditions in human fetuses.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the intense activity of the immune system and the cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune system response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is separate from CoV replication.
The strategy of isolating the immune system response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responses in bats are particularly strong.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I should be useful, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
Furthermore, NLRP3 enzyme activation is defective in bats.
With this argument, NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general context of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV events.
While bat beta-CoV has 95% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV, there is also a bat beta-CoV that has 96% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
While it has been identified that seal and other market animals were shelters for viruses like SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that pangolins may act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is no evidence yet that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally made by humans, although questions remain.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the importance of animal origin and reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
There is strong evidence that MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from human-to-whale contact in markets, the closure of the seafood market and the killing of whale sharks effectively ended SARS.
With this in mind, pangolins should be removed from the marine animal market to prevent animal-to-human transmission, which is due to the discovery of several cases of pangolin beta-CoV ancestors that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, clarification of how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from pangolins and other mammals to humans still requires further research.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in mountain camels for a long time.
These camels are considered an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
These camels are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to produce effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, along with other infection control measures.
Because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause disease outbreaks.
Human-animal co-viruses are circulating in wildlife.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal-to-human transmission potential are highly diverse.
There are many opportunities for these human-animal co-CoVs to grow and recombine, leading to the emergence of new highly transmissible and deadly CoVs.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the tough test that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 had for us, we need to have a better plan for preparedness and response.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until they have a chance to overflow.
Although bats have many traits that help spread viruses, if people are trained to avoid them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, and will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and spread.
Consequently, the most effective way to prevent human-animal co-infections is to keep humans away from the natural ecological reservoirs of human-animal co-infections.
Several pieces of the animal origin puzzle for SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be found.
First, if the bat has transmitted a SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to the pangolin, it would be interesting to see under what conditions the bat and pangolin could coexist in a shared ecological situation.
Second, if bats play a direct role in transmission to humans, how did humans come into contact with bats?
Third, if a third mammal has acted as the actual intermediate host, how does it interact with different species including humans, bats, and pangolins.
And finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental co-infection should be performed.
Whether the target animal is a bat, pangolin or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses, which are nearly identical, are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating of COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for "suspected" and "confirmed" is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guide to the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is a representative of our experience and a good reference for the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on advancing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this article, we provided a view of our guideline and provided the most up-to-date diagnostic criteria for "suspicious material" and "confirmed material" based on the latest guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak of disease that is now officially named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Our team has developed a quick guide to combating SARS-CoV-2 disease and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has received a lot of attention since its publication.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the advancing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, strategies for diagnosis and treatment are continually updated.
For example, the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published a total of seven times between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, with some changes to the text.
Now Zhou and colleagues have provided a vision for our guide, which includes a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their papers added new evidence to our guide and also provided valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We acknowledge and commend their outstanding work.
However, their articles should be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (edition 7) and recent studies.
According to the seventh revision (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, one of the characteristics of the history of the pandemic must be combined with two cases of clinical manifest symptoms to provide a comprehensive analysis, or if it has no history of the pandemic, it must meet three of the clinical manifest symptoms:
Epidemiologic history: (1) previous travel to or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) previous contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) previous contact with patients with fever or respiratory illness from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) previous contact with confirmed clusters (more than 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, classroom, school, etc.).
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) increased total white blood cell count, which represents normal, decreased lymphocyte count in the early stages of disease.
Confirmed cases should be diagnosed based on suspected cases with one of the following: (1) a PCR blood test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a whole-virus genome sequence showing high similarity to the novel coronavirus; (3) a positive SARS-CoV-2 serum IgM-specific antibody and IgG-specific antibody; or a change in SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive, or an increase of more than 4-fold in titer in the recovery versus acute phase.
We can see that the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions have been added to the PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples.
Pathogenic diagnosis was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then viral evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers seeking an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid detection, and also on the respiratory sampling including blood sampling, which has allowed for greater access to variants and supported positive specific antibody in the validated criteria.
Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that warns us to be cautious about unusual symptoms and patients who are asymptomatic.
Therefore, the chart of Zhou and colleagues needs to be updated, because in this flowchart, the person without clinical symptoms is classified as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be confirmed in practice and with more clinical studies.
To summarize, we hope to bring forward more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their own views.
For the detection of "suspect sources" and "confirmed sources", we suggest that physicians follow the latest guidelines in their countries.
Our team will also regularly update the guide to providing assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily number ever.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on this day.
This was the highest number of daily deaths from the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the recorded cases of infection included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who are resting at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, IEDCR director, said in an online press conference that the death toll was four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 50 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of COVID-19.
A hospital employee told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead, Jalal Seifur Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Obaidul Quader, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, announced in an online video notification that public transport would be closed until next Saturday, longer than originally planned.
The public transportation strike initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of basic goods - medical supplies, fuel and food - continued.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on 8 March, in two travelers who had returned from Italy, and the spouse of one of them.
On March 19, the three recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than one million people worldwide
Johns Hopkins University data shows that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths are attributed to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The day became a milestone with the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Malawi and the first coronavirus-related death in Zambia.
North Korea on Thursday claimed to be one of the few countries free of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases as of yesterday, of which 79,332 were related to the twenty-four hours before 10am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS NEWS reported that more than 1,000 deaths were reported in the United States due to coronavirus infection on Wednesday, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have taken more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, on Thursday extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that all Russian workers will be paid their salaries by April 30 without having to go to work.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency for another 15 days; the law was passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all hours of the day; previously, the curfew was only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio, announced that the state has extended the home quarantine rule until 1 May.
Australian supermarkets have reduced their toilet tissue quota every time they buy.
Woolworths and Coles retailers in Australia reduced the toilet paper purchase limit across all stores nationwide to two and one pack per purchase, respectively, on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
ALDI also announced a one-package limit on Monday.
The restrictions are announced in the form of messages on the boxes and on the chain's Facebook page.
Shoppers are reportedly shopping and storing out of fear of being required to quarantine themselves due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes followed the previous four-pack-per-purchase limitation announced on March 4 and 5, respectively, by Woolworths and Coles.
Coles announced in a press release on March 8 that despite the four-pack limit, "many stores will run out of stock within an hour" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI described it as "unexpected" on its Facebook page on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, sales experienced a "severe surge" last week.
Costco in Canberra also reduced the number of items allowed to be bought to two last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles has ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery times to stores, Woolworths has ordered more inventory, and ALDI has made inventory available earlier for one of its Wednesday specials.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase their inventory, but local council timing restrictions on delivery trucks have made it difficult.
He said he expected production costs to rise as suppliers try to meet demand and special sales to decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores would not be able to hold special sales on Wednesday due to early stock.
Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, reported on News.com.au that stores are stocking up every night.
He added that the sheer volume of toiletries leads to a shortage of stocks in stores and when the product is finished, it empties a lot of shelf space and creates a sense of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Coles and Woolworths believe that if there are many products on the shelves, if products like toilet paper and disinfectant are in high supply and available for purchase, your fear will likely be minimized.
Who Gives a Crap, the maker of recycled toilet paper, announced last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent toilet paper, both confirmed they are operating 24/7 to meet demand.
Domain.com, a real estate activist site, reported that when fewer auctions were held due to the long Labor Day weekend holiday lockdown, some real estate salespeople donated free toilet paper to the first bidders in Melbourne.
The Thursday edition of NT News, one of Darwin's newspapers, had an eight-page special to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia on 3 March, these stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions and stated that they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other goods, including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, toiletries and flour.
Outside Australia, similarly, the British online supermarket Ocado saw the Andres toiletware purchase limitation to two 12-pack rolls on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 - caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of a disease outbreak, not its severity, WHO nonetheless stressed the need to push governments to take countermeasures:
All countries can still change the duration of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of WHO, said that countries should prepare their people to be diagnosed, tested, treated, quarantined and tracked.
We are deeply concerned, both by the alarming level of the outbreak and its severity and the alarming level of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In statements released by CNN in February, he said, "Other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from its origin to its ongoing global outbreak.
Ghebreyesus also said in similar remarks, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before".
"And we have never seen a pandemic that is, at the same time, manageable before", he continued.
The new pandemic status was declared following the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "The frontline situation is getting worse".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an emerging pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated to be around 4%, while globally it ranges from 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications can include allergic pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between the virus entering the body and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for it.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping away from other people, and monitoring and self-quarantine for people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded to the virus with travel restrictions, quarantines, military rule, workplace risk controls, and lockouts.
The pandemic has resulted in severe socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread resource shortages exacerbated by neuro-shopping.
Schools and universities have been closed in 193 countries either nationally or locally, affecting 99.4% of students worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and other people of East and Southeast Asian ethnicity and appearance, as well as others from areas where the virus is widespread.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased due to travel restrictions and the closure of heavy industry.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
These cases were mostly linked to the Havana seafood wholesale market, and for this reason it is thought that the virus may have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV.The first known symptomatic case was later identified on 1 December 2019, and this person was not apparently related to the next seafood market group.
It was found that of the initial cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were linked to this market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post claimed that a case had been detected on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province who could be the first case.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that despite a reported decline in cases in China, there had been a sudden rise in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases inside China for the first time.
The number of cases may be significantly underreported, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under representing only 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that around 60% of the UK population would need to be infected to achieve effective population immunity.
Cases means the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that as of 23 January, about 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected, and these unrecorded cases were the source of infection for 79% of the recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of cases in Italy significantly exceeded the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline viral count (R0) for COVID-19 have been between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time between onset of symptoms and death was between 6 and 41 days, with the most common period being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were among people over 60 years of age, 70% of whom had a concomitant illness including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official statistics on the number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who tested positive for COVID, based on official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 could be much higher, as these figures may not include people who died without testing - for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data from Italy showed that the number of deaths without testing during the pandemic was about 5 to 4 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated, "We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual figure", which is consistent with unofficial reports of underreporting in the US. Such actions often occur in pandemics, including the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred on 9 January 2020 in Wuhan.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were reported in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of 13 March, deaths were reported in over forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as of 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies from region to region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (for people with onset of symptoms on January 10-1, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of identified infected people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (undiagnosed) people who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall disease mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
This maximum range estimate is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 trial in Germany, as well as a statistical study that analysed the effect of the trial on the CFR estimate.
WHO emphasizes that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak cannot be stated with certainty and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Common infectious diseases tend to stabilize if no action is taken to control them, and begin to decline once the disease is out of available hosts.
But at the moment, it's impossible to make any reasonable predictions about when that will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries mobilized to follow the World Health Organization recommendations on containment measures, "the disease could be over by June".
Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine announced on 17 March that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably be around for one or two years".
According to research led by Neil Ferguson at the Royal College of Physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is developed (probably 18 months or longer)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated "I think the probability of this coronavirus disappearing completely is low - because it is easily transmissible" and "it may become a seasonal disease that returns every year".
The severity of this return will depend on the collective immunity and the severity of the outbreak.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific, and people with the disease may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, chest discharge, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremors, vomiting, blood clots, diarrhea, and cyanosis. The World Health Organization states that approximately one in six people will become seriously ill with difficulty breathing.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published a list of emergency symptoms: difficulty breathing, feeling of pain or pressure in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, swelling of the face and lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and even death.
Some people with the disease may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm the infection, so researchers recommend that people who have been in close contact with infected people should be closely monitored and tested to prevent their transmission.
Estimates by China of the asymptomatic rate have ranged from very low to 44 percent.
The typical incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; in the most common case, this is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell initially was 30% but later dropped to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still emerging.
It is thought to be transmitted primarily by close contact, by small particles produced by coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact means a distance between 1 and 2 metres (3 and 6 ft).
Studies have shown that bare-knuckle surfing can disperse small particles between 4.5 meters (15 feet) and 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some studies have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small particles produced by speaking that remain in the air for longer periods of time. Although the virus is not generally airborne, small respiratory particles can be produced by breathing, including speaking.
These particles can land in the mouth or nose of people nearby or be transported to their lungs through respiration.
Certain medical procedures such as respiratory plumbing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can lead to the spraying of respiratory secretions into the air, resulting in the spread of airborne disease.
It is also transmitted when a person touches an infected surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of transmission through faeces, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Although there is a possibility of transmission before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease, the highest incidence is in the first three days of onset.
People who test positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms indicate that transmission is possible before the onset of significant symptoms.
There are few reports of asymptomatic cases that have been laboratory confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during communication tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that while the rapid spread of the disease is not fully understood, usually one infected person can infect two or three others.
Specifically, it has been found that the virus survives for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel surfaces, up to one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, these values can vary depending on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that was first identified from three people with pneumonia who were in contact with a group of people with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that removes its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
This virus is thought to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the species Betacoronavirus, a subtype of the sarbovirus (genus B) with two genes derived from bats.
It is 96 times identical to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) samples in the total genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that pangolin viruses and human viruses differ by only one amino acid in certain parts of their genome sequence.
A full genome comparison to date has found that up to 92% of the genetic material is shared between pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Infection with the virus can be provisionally diagnosed by symptoms, however, final confirmation is made by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and yet less specific because many of the imaging features of CT overlap with other inflammatory lung diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or primary test for COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
This test uses instantaneous reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on breath and blood samples.
These tests usually take between a few hours and a few days to complete.
Usually, the test is done with a nasopharynx swab, however, a glue swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are working on serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these methods were sufficiently precise to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex for emergency use has only been approved by some reputable laboratories.
Characteristic imaging features in radiography and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral granulomas and absence of lateral thrush.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of imaging findings from confirmed cases of the disease.
Unconfirmed PCR imaging cannot be used specifically to detect COVID-19 due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and found that although less specific imaging is useful for diagnosis, it is faster and more sensitive, and suggested that it could be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
AI-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging features of the virus both by radiography and by CT.
Some ways to prevent transmission include proper personal hygiene, hand washing, not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with hands, and holding a towel when coughing or sneezing, and throwing towels directly into the trash.
People with pre-existing conditions are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing is also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have banned or advised against non-essential travel to countries or areas where the disease is common.
However, the virus has reached community-level outbreaks in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and some people do not know where or how they became infected.People providing health care to potential infected people are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions and to wear eye protection. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to limit this type of surveillance.
Various mobile phone applications have been created or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on non-privacy-infringing solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. Some misconceptions are spreading about how to prevent the disease; for example, rinsing the nose or snoring with mouthwash are not effective ways.
Although many organizations are working on developing a vaccine, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body with household soap, which removes its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based disinfectants with a minimum of 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with their sitting hands.
Removal of surface contamination is possible by various methods (one minute exposure to sterilizing agents for stainless steel surfaces), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% betadine.
Other methods, including benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID in a building such as an office or day care center, all areas such as offices, health services, common areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by people who are sick should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with their elbows or handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing, and that they throw away handkerchiefs immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who are at risk of infection, as wearing a mask can reduce the volume and range of particles that are dispersed when talking, sneezing or coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the desire of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection if proper hand hygiene is not observed".
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for people with COVID-19, however, they also acknowledge that wearing masks helps people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage people in the community to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made from fabric. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 ft) or less) with others.
Hong Kong has recommended that surgical masks be worn when using public transport or stopping in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make masks at home using cloth and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public gatherings and outdoor activities without masks or nose-covers.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested all citizens to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has made it mandatory for people to wear masks when visiting grocery stores.
Israel has required all of its residents to wear masks when attending public gatherings.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has required passengers on intercity trains and buses to wear masks from 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask when outdoors, and has advised those who cannot afford to buy a mask to make their own at home.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimising close contact between people.
These include quarantines; travel restrictions; closures of schools and workplaces, stadiums, theatres, and shopping malls.
People can implement these practices by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, saying no to contact and physical distancing from others.
Currently, many governments have mandated or recommended social distancing in areas where the disease is endemic.
The maximum recommended number of people to gather by US government agencies and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 (if there was no COVID-19 outbreak in the area) to 50 and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and immune deficiency are at higher risk for severe complications and the CDC has advised these people to stay at home as much as possible in areas where the disease is prevalent in the community.In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to make it clear that the purpose of this is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social ties, both virtually and remotely.
The use of the term "social distancing" rather than encouraging people to maintain contact through alternative means implied that individuals should be in complete social isolation.
These guidelines included recommendations to only have sex with a person you live with, someone who is not infected with the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Home quarantine is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of infection.
Health organizations have detailed guidelines for proper self-quarantine.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all people living in affected areas.
The most stringent personal quarantine guidelines have been issued for those in high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with people with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or area where the disease is widespread are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of their last contact.
Strategies to control the spread of a disease include containment, suppression, and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking down and isolating infected individuals, as well as introducing other disease control measures and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to a strategy of mitigation: actions are taken to reduce the incidence and its impact on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be implemented simultaneously.
Countering requires more drastic measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline infection rate to less than 1. As part of managing an infectious disease outbreak, efforts to reduce the peak of the pandemic are known as curb-flattening.
This reduces the risk of overloading healthcare and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacological interventions that can help manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, mask wearing, self-quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing including school closures and cancellation of events where there are large crowds; social engagement to encourage acceptance and adherence to these interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also implemented a range of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented group screening and local quarantine and issued evacuation advisories.
Singapore provided financial support for those infected who self-quarantined and imposed heavy fines on those who did not do so.
Taiwan increased mask production and introduced penalties for the importation of medical supplies. Simulations conducted for the UK and the US show that mitigation (diminishing rather than stopping the spread of the pandemic) and containment (reversing the spread of the pandemic) strategies are facing major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak demand for healthcare by two thirds and the death rate by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and put undue pressure on the healthcare system.
Suppression may be the best strategy, but it must be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first), because if measures are abandoned, the rate of infection will quickly return to its previous level.
Long-term intervention to contain the pandemic will have social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug for COVID-19, although efforts are underway to develop one, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter medications, drinking fluids, and rest can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and breathing aids may be required.
Steroid use can make the situation worse.
Several compounds that have already been approved for other viral diseases are being studied for potential use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO has also identified "several traditional and home remedies" that can help alleviate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has described capacity building and adapting health systems to the needs of COVID-19 patients as one of the key measures to combat the spread of the disease.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to shift resources to different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating unnecessary surgical procedures where possible, isolating and confining patients with COVID-19, and increasing capacity in intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are different opinions about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.
The first case of the new coronavirus may date back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a period of one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these people were associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from a type of these animals; in other words, the virus has an animal origin.A group of people with pneumonia of unknown cause were observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported the matter to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police advised eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, to refrain from spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was punished by his superiors for issuing the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on 31 December, informing the World Health Organization.
A large number of pneumonia cases of unknown cause were reported to Wuhan health officials, prompting an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, due to travel related to the Chinese New Year and due to Wuhan being one of the transportation hubs and major railway exchange hubs.
On 20 January 2020, China reported about 140 new cases, including one in Beijing and one in Shenzhen in a single day.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people were symptomatic as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, ahead of China and Italy.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.31 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died and 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and started border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the outbreak, including quarantine (also known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or home quarantine) and military rule.As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of home quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Korea, and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of quarantine, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan on 1 December; an unconfirmed report says the first case was on 17 November.

On December 31, a public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.
The World Health Organization was notified the same day.
With these reports, the police warned Wuhan doctors about the "rumour spreading" of the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a major campaign called "People's War" to contain the spread of the virus, later described by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a sanitary belt was identified on 23 January that stopped entry and exit from Wuhan, spreading to a total of 15 cities in Hubei Province and affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced that a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, would be built, which was completed in 10 days.

On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the disease transmission within the country has been substantially stopped and the outbreak in China is controlled.
On the same day, two months after the quarantine, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, except for the city of Wuhan.On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry to the country for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, without providing details on when the policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China will have to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provided monetary incentives to companies.The State Council announced that public mourning would be observed on 4 April, which coincides with the Day of the People of the Grave, and would begin with three minutes of national silence at 10:00 am, however, the central government asked families to pay their respects online to maintain physical distancing and to prevent the re-emergence of COVID-19.

On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after three soldiers tested positive.
The airline schedule was also affected and changed as a result. South Korea introduced a screening and isolation program, the largest and most organized in the world, to screen and isolate all infected people and to track and quarantine those who had been in contact with them.
Screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms for newly arrived international travellers via a mobile app, test centres that can be accessed by car and results are known the next day, and increasing testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program, despite not quarantining entire cities, is considered one of the most successful in controlling the outbreak.
Many Koreans signed petitions to impeach Moon for what they called mismanagement, and others praised his reaction.

Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. In February, Iran became the center of the outbreak after China.
Among claims to conceal the true extent of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February, tracking of cases in more than ten countries revealed that they had originated in Iran, suggesting that the true extent of the outbreak was likely higher than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.

A CNN report found that the combination of the large population of older people and the inability to test all those who have the virus to date could be contributing to the high death rate.
The UK response to the virus was one of the most modest among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.

On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.
The WHO director-general said that "the organization is deeply concerned, both by the alarming level of the outbreak and its severity, and the alarming level of inadequate action".The WHO faced a lot of criticism for the inadequate management of the pandemic, including the delayed declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical supplies due to increased consumer demand and supply disruption.
Several locations have also seen nervous shopping, leading to empty shelves of essential essentials such as food, toiletries and mineral water, and creating a sense of scarcity.
In particular, the tech industry has warned about delays in shipping of electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the World Health Organization, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.

In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity caused a shortage of milk powder in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the subsequent high demand for food, both areas have been left with severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy to combat the monopoly and illegal buying and selling of essential products have been successful, preventing the severe food shortages that were predicted in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with a significant supply of agricultural products, has not experienced severe shortages, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.

Many see a recession as a possibility.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency and timely measures of central banks and governments.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did in the 2008 financial crisis.
Due to travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the advice of governments to refrain from any travel around the world, tourism is one of the sectors that has suffered the most.
As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas have cancelled flights due to falling demand, and regional airline Flybe in the UK has been closed.
The negative impact of the virus on the cruise ship industry has been unprecedented.
Several train stations and ports were also closed.
The pandemic coincided with Chunyun, one of the main travel seasons associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Events including New Year festivals with large crowds were cancelled by national or regional governments, and private companies including Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai also independently closed their stores and a number of tourist attractions.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs, were closed to prevent crowds from gathering.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until 10 February, ordering most workplaces not to reopen on that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of infectious disease response to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and cancelled New Year celebrations.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East saw a 60-50% drop in referrals.
The outbreak also led to a 43-33% decrease in foot traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Major shopping mall operators around the world have taken other measures, including increased hygiene, the installation of temperature scanners to check the body temperature of shoppers, and the cancellation of events.According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession created by the pandemic could push between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America into extreme poverty, a situation that would not have occurred without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
A large part of the population, about 300 million rural migrant workers, were trapped in their homes in the interior provinces or in Hubei Province.
The coronavirus outbreak could affect 47 million US jobs, and the unemployment rate could rise by as much as 32%, according to projections by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdowns in India have left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who were paid on a daily basis) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Foundation found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany sent their workers to short-term government-subsidized work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term compensation scheme has also been implemented by France and the United Kingdom.
The performing arts and heritage sectors have also been hit hard by the pandemic, with both the operations and manpower of related organizations - both employed and independent - affected across the globe.
Organizations active in the field of culture and art have tried to continue their mission (often financed by state funds) to ensure community access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls, and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed indefinitely, and exhibitions, events, and performances have been cancelled or postponed to varying degrees.
Instead, many efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another consequence of the disease, which has recently been accelerating, is the cancellation of religious ceremonies, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced problems. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week liturgy in Rome, held during the last week of the Christian season of fasting and penance, has been canceled.
Many dioceses have advised older Christians to stay home rather than attend Sunday Mass; some churches have made church services available via radio, live online or television, and others have made it possible to attend services by car.
The Roman Catholic bishops closed their churches and places of worship, and St. Peter's Square was emptied of Christian pilgrims, while other religious institutions canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and processions.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas, and the shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest disruption to the sporting calendar around the world since World War II.
Most major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season have been either cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has affected the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled for a date further than 2020, at the latest for summer 2021".Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed, and live poker tournaments have been either cancelled or postponed.
This has brought many gamblers to online sites, many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their sign-up rates, the entertainment industry has been hit, and many bands have suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including Broadway, have suspended all performances.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue to produce and share artwork over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, including live streaming concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work.
Online, many internet memes have been circulating on the topic of the coronavirus, many of them dealing with humor and miscellaneous issues amid the uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in discrimination, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as people in the centres of the disease in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been instances of fear, suspicion and hostile behavior.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) have shown a rise in racist sentiment in various groups around the world about whether Chinese people are to blame for the virus or are suffering from the scourge of the wave.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an upsurge in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
There has been support for Chinese people, both online and offline, in areas affected by the virus.
After the disease spread to other countries, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, were also subject to suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the outbreak.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese nationals, as well as other Asians in the UK and the US, reported an increase in racist insults and attacks against them.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus the "Chinese virus", a term that critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreigners who were evacuated from Wuhan and were being transferred to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, who were studying in major Indian cities, reportedly experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the head of the state chapter of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal declared that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "for this reason, God has taken revenge on them".
These remarks were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as "untrue". In China, the pandemic fueled xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being called "foreign trash" and targeted for "dismissal".
Many paid-for newspapers have eliminated the subscription fee for all or part of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific articles related to the outbreak freely available.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and only detects the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
This test is used to confirm very new or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population monitoring.
Antibody testing shows how many people have had the disease, including those who have very mild symptoms and have not reported them, or have no symptoms at all.
Using the results of this test, the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the disease in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large differences in the number of tests conducted between countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the reported death rate, which has probably been overestimated in some countries.
The test, which uses instantaneous reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), can be performed on respiratory samples taken in a variety of ways, including nasopharynx swabs or a mixed sample.
These test results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with throat swabs provide reliable results only in the first week of illness.
After that, the virus can disappear from the throat, while it is replicating in the lungs.
For infected individuals tested in the second week, alternative samples can be drawn from deep tracheal inhalation by catheter suction, or it is possible to use substances obtained from coughing (mixing).
One of the first examples of a PCR test was developed in January 2020 at the Charité in Berlin using the instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test method by 23 January 2020. Kogenebiotech of South Korea developed a PCR-based clinical diagnostic kit for SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
The kit looks for the "E" gene that is common to all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval for a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based diagnostic kit from the National Organization of Chinese Medical Products.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the RT-PCR diagnostic panel for the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kit was leading to inconclusive results due to defective agents and testing limitations at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to an average of fewer than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February.
It was not until February 28, 2020, that the two-component test was reliably diagnosed, and after that, state and local laboratories were allowed to test it.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories began conducting the test in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing is available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics similarly made COVID-19 testing available nationwide as of 9 March 2020.
No limitation on the number of tests was announced; sampling and processing must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the production and development of the COVID-19 test kit was carried out by the State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test for COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in 3.5 hours at high volume, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA had previously issued similar licenses to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received EUA clearance from the FDA for the 45-minute trial.
The FDA has approved a trial that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, the method can give a positive result in only five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott expects to be able to deliver 50,000 tests per day as production ramps up.A test that uses the monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, and it is hoped that it will deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes, just like a rapid flu test.
A review of research conducted in March 2020 concluded that "X-rays of the chest have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] findings can be detected even before symptoms appear".
Typical features in CT include a double-lobed multi-lobed macroscopic codor with lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, sub-flank overgrowth, deformity and stiffening occurs.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the origin of the current pandemic, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and yet less specific because many of the imaging features of CT overlap with other inflammatory lung diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as screening or primary test for COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR method for primary screening.
Part of the immune system's response to this infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after 7 days or more of onset of symptoms, immunity, and population surveillance.
High-capacity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production of each system.
For CLT, a single sample of peripheral blood is usually used, although several blood samples may be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually taken by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, it does not require a pre-test extraction step.On 26 March 2020, the FDA released a list of 29 entities that had notified the agency as requested and were therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun and Epitope Diagnostics Medical Diagnostics Laboratories received European approval for their test kits, which could detect IgG and IgA antibodies that had been screened against the virus and were present in a blood sample.
The capacity of the test is several hundred samples in a few hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional PCR test for the detection of viral RNA.
These antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the disease.In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased were suitable for use.
Hong Kong implemented a scheme whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a swab", the patient will pour saliva into it and return it, and receive the test result some time later. The UK NHS has announced that it is piloting a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of others becoming infected if the patient visits the hospital, as well as the need to disinfect it if an ambulance is used.
The vehicle testing centers have enabled South Korea to operate one of the fastest and most extensive testing practices in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians announced on 2 March that it has a capacity to conduct 12,000 tests per day on mobile, with 10,700 people tested in the previous week.
If the test is ordered by a doctor, the costs are paid by the health insurance.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, testing with the car is available in several major cities.
Until 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unclear, as only positive results were reported.
A laboratory questionnaire showed that a total of at least 483,295 samples had been tested by the end of the week of 12/2020, with 33,491 samples (6.9%) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, doing so by combining samples and then testing further only if the result of the combining sample was positive.In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, a temporary emergency diagnostic laboratory of 2,000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼 or "eye of fire") was opened by the BGI with a capacity to process 10,000 samples per day.
The lab took five days to build and was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, modeling that if this testing capacity had not been operational, the number of cases in Wuhan would have been 47% higher and the cost of quarantine doubled.
Similar Wuhan labs called Huo-Yan Labs were immediately set up in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity reached 500,000 tests per day. Open and composite designs released by Origami Experiments can test 1,122 patient samples using only 93 COVID-19 test kits. These balanced designs are feasible in small labs and without the need for a robotic fluid examiner.
By March, shortages and the lack of sufficient reagents had become a barrier to mass testing in Europe, the UK and the US.
This has led some authors to review sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free up the RNA genome for further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE is now testing a large proportion of its population for coronavirus, with a higher per capita ratio than any other country, and is thus on track to achieve testing for a large proportion of its population.
This was made possible by the ability to test with the car and purchase a large laboratory at the scale of the entire population of the country from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency diagnosis laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, and is the first lab of this scale to operate outside of China.
Different protocols for testing that target different parts of the coronavirus's genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization used the German guideline to supply and ship the kit to low-income countries that lacked the resources to produce the kits domestically.
The German test kit guidelines were published on 17 January 2020. The delay in the start of the tests in the United States was caused by the fact that the protocol developed by the US Centres for Disease Control was not available until 28 January. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries, along with Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and the number of cases recommended by health professionals for testing.
In contrast, experts say the widespread availability of testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The capacity to conduct testing, mostly in private sector laboratories, has been built up by the South Korean government over the years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for strengthening testing programs as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be postponed at private laboratories in the US and the stock of swabs and reagents to be scarce.
In March 2020, China reported problems in measuring the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits produced by the CDC were "defective". The government then removed the bureaucratic obstacles to private testing. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the test results were not correct.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a sample collection problem or misuse of the kits.
The Spanish minister announced that kits that gave false results would not be used and would be replaced by a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic gave false results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that gave false results.
Prime Minister Matvić suggested that the kits be dumped into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said the test kits Turkey had purchased from China had a "high error rate" and were "not usable". The UK government purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that the kits were unusable.
This was followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the tracing of those who had been in contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy occurred, conducted two rounds of testing 10 days apart on a total population of about 3,400 people.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all of the positive cases were quarantined.
With restrictions on travel to public facilities, new infections have been completely eliminated.
With strict contact tracing, restrictions, testing and quarantine of incoming travellers, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much slower than other developed countries, without severe restrictions such as mandatory closures of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events have been cancelled and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened after the holiday on 23 March and on time.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, also managed the pandemic by strictly tracking contacts, restricting, testing, and quarantining incoming travelers, albeit with fewer closures.
A statistical study has shown that countries that have conducted more tests than the number of patients have much lower mortality rates, possibly because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with limited testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 test samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the "% positive to total testing" column is influenced by each country's testing policy.
If all other conditions are the same, the "positive percent to total testing" would be higher in a country that tests only those admitted to hospitals compared to a country that tests all citizens, whether symptomatic or not.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning one's hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Constant hand washing with soap at "sensitive sites" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhoea and the plague, which is transmitted through feces.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may develop respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds.
The five important times during the day when hand washing with soap is important are before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing in the following cases:
Before, during, and after the meal.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a baby after using the toilet.
After fining, coughing or sneezing.
after touching animals, feeding animals or feeding animal waste.
Hand hygiene refers to the hygiene measures related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing in medical terms is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other disease-causing microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who work in food or in medical professions, but it's also important for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing diarrheal infectious agents; reducing respiratory infections; and reducing the risk of infection from the mouth;
And reducing the mortality rate of babies born at home.
A 2013 study found that improvements in hand-washing practices may have led to a slight improvement in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, death rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhoea in children can be reduced by promoting simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action could reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50 percent.
Actions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about one-third, comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap as a routine practice in homes, schools and communities around the world is the single most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, an important acute respiratory infection, is one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five, killing about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a firm habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cut diarrhea deaths by almost half, and reduce deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against yellow fever infection that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the harmful but minor effects of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to dryness and consequent skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin rashes, also known as hand eczema or dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Excessive and frequent hand washing is also cited as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five important times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease are: after going to the bathroom (fecal, faecal), after cleaning the baby (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other situations where proper hand washing should be observed to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after contact with garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is very low.
In 2015, a study on hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households have made hand washing with soap a habit. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing with soap, at 97%, the United States was in the middle at 77%, and China was at the bottom at 23%. There are currently several ways to change behavior to increase hand washing with soap on important occasions.
The basic health care program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a broad range of measures to improve health and education in children.
Deworming twice a year, along with daily handwashing with soap, and brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is the main focus of this national program.
Indonesia has also successfully implemented this program.
The addition of soap or detergent to water is effective in removing microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the solubility barrier and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleanser for skin because fats and proteins that are part of organic soil do not dissolve easily in water.
However, sufficient water flow helps to clean.
Solid soaps may retain bacteria from previous uses due to their reusable nature.
A small number of studies that have looked at the transmission of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that bacterial transmission through this route appears unlikely because the bacteria are washed away with soap.
The CDC still believes that "liquid soap that is accessible without direct hand contact is better".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted for people who care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that disinfectants or disinfectants are effective in killing naturally occurring antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which a wide variety of organisms are resistant to.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not eliminated by antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as advertised.
Advanced formulations in addition to surfactants and skin preservatives may include acids (ascorbic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobial-active benzoic acid, and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamin, menthol, plant extract). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that plain soap is as effective as regular antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and killing hand bacteria.
The hot water used for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap in removing natural oils that contain dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water does not reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer is a non-aqueous sanitary material.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based disinfectants or hand sanitizers) gained popularity.
Most of these are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a thickener such as carboomer (polymer of acrylic acid) and in the form of a gel, or use a diluent such as glycerine to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol and are made in liquid or foam form.
Addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobials containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol are effective antimicrobials.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, mumps, RSV, rhinovirus, cowpox, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Hand sanitizers containing 70% alkali kill 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5 logs equals a reduction of 35 decibels) of hand bacteria within 30 seconds of use and 99.99% to 99.999% (a reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of hand bacteria within 1 minute of use. Hand sanitizers are effective against bacteria but less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norwalk virus, the most common cause of infectious disease. Sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol-containing gel should be used to keep both hands completely wet or covered.
The back and sides of both hands and the tips of all the fingers should be rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing the soles of both hands. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing over the use of hand sanitizer, especially when hands are completely dirty.
The increasing use of these materials is due to their ease of use and ability to quickly kill microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless moisturizers or skin moisturizers are added to their formulations.
Adding glycerin or other emollients to their formula can reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers containing alcohol and emollients caused much less skin burning and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urine syndrome, or allergies to alcohol or additives in alcohol-containing hand sanitizers are rare.
The lower risk of contact dermatitis compared to hand washing with soap and water made them attractive.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based materials do not clean hands of organic matter, but instead disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many diseases, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effect of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on their ingredients and formulation, and has historically been less effective than alcohol-containing sanitizers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have more cumulative and persistent antimicrobial activity after use, as opposed to alcohol, which decreases its effectiveness after repeated use, possibly due to adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot make soap, and use ashes or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Ash is also a disinfectant, as it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, the World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as a soap substitute.
Proper handwashing recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because stagnant water may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Rub your hands with enough soap and scrub, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap destroys germs on the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds.
Hand rubbing creates friction and helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing your hands for longer will kill more germs.
Wash your hands with a good drip.
Washing in stagnant water can re-infect the hand.
Dry with a clean towel or air-dry.
Wet, wet hands can easily become infected. The most commonly affected areas are the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers, and the area under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and exfoliated nail polish may be the hiding place of microorganisms.
Moisturizers are often recommended to prevent dryness of the hands. Dry skin has led to skin damage and can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
There are various low-cost options for facilitating handwashing in developing countries when tap water or soap is not available, such as pouring water from a hanging gallon or perforated container or using ash if necessary. In situations where water resources are limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water consumption, such as "tippy-tap or small water taps", and other low-cost options.
The tap tap is a simple technology that consists of a container suspended by a rope, a lever controlled by the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands, and a soap spoon.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public restrooms.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric dryers that are found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Textile Symposium was conducted by the University of Westminster in London to compare the hygiene of paper towels, hot air dryers and the more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria in fingertips increased by an average of 194% and bacteria in the soles by 254%.
Hand drying with an air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria in the fingertips by 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other toilet and washing environment users due to the use of different hand drying methods.
The air jet dryer, which is claimed to blow air out at 180 meters per second (650 kilometers or 400 miles per hour), is capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and appliances and could potentially contaminate other toilet users as well as the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a hot air dryer, it can disperse microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not cause significant releases of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined various hand drying methods.
The following changes were observed in a number of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
If soap and water are not available during travel, hand washing with hand sanitizing wipes can be used as an alternative method.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the efficacy of hand washing (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital setting, hand washing became mandatory.
There are electronic devices that can remind hospital staff if they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that the rate of infection was reduced by using them.
The time required for a hand medication is at least 15 seconds, which is done using sufficient amount of soap and water or gel and rubbing all parts of the hand.
The hands must be rubbed together and the fingers must be interlocked.
If there are cracks under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water on the hands, it is important that the hands are well-watered and dried with a clean towel.
After drying the hand, the paper towel should be used to close the water faucet (and if necessary to open the outlet).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands by contact with those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in healthcare facilities is to kill pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing is unacceptable in most hospital settings, with many doctors and nurses often forgetting to wash their hands before contacting patients, thus facilitating the transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the amount of bloodstream contamination from catheters by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a white paper that sets out the standard way to wash and rub hands together in health care settings.
The draft hand hygiene guide prepared by the organization is also available to the public on its website.
A related study was done by Whitby and colleagues.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene levels if required to demonstrate compliance with established regulations.
The World Health Organization has defined "five times" to wash your hands:
After exposure to blood/ bodily fluids
Before the work of disinfection, and
After patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (soaps "medicinal" or "anti-microbial") enhances the lethality of the hand washing agent.
Such measures may be considered before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are prevalent. To wash hands before surgery, it is necessary to have a water hose that can be opened and closed without direct contact, a quantity of chlorhexidine or laxative, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing them, and a sterilized washing brush and other sterilized equipment to clean the nails.
All the jewels must be brought out.
This method requires the hands and wrists to be washed from the elbow for usually 2-6 minutes.
No need for a long wash (10 minutes).
When pulling water, avoid the water from returning to the armpit.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical gowns are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from handwashing is obtained from 20% first wash and that there is very little additional benefit when handwashing frequency reaches more than 35%.
Handwashing with plain soap compared to antibacterial soap is three times more likely to transmit bacterial infectious diseases to food. A comparison of handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds showed that handwashing with an alcohol-based solution reduced the level of bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, the use of soap and water is more effective than hand washing with alcohol-based products in reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile from the hands.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an affordable and essential tool for achieving good health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or handwashing devices in homes, schools and workplaces challenges the achievement of the necessary handwashing behaviours globally.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, taps for handwashing near private or public toilets are rare, although there are cheaper options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates, not so much because of a lack of soap or water, but could be the result of our bad habits.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence election policies, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioural change at the community level.
The necessary monitoring and evaluation is necessary to ensure that this is effective.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, while social advocacy campaigns are less effective.One example for promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while adhering to other hygiene requirements.
By adhering to the minimum standards, schools can eventually be upgraded from one star to three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of public awareness campaigns for handwashing, which is aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality in children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness program that aims to change people's behavior.
Few studies have generally discounted the cost savings of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the number of years lost to disability.
However, one study found that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other measures.
The importance of handwashing to human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as new mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospital - was first noted in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by a foul odor called myasthema.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne illness and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more widely as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against infectious diseases.
For example, posters titled "Proper handwashing practices" were displayed next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of something" is a declaration of one's unwillingness to accept responsibility for or share in something.
The term is borrowed from the Bible book of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate renounced the decision to crucify Jesus, but the term is now used in some English communities with much wider application.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs Macbeth is forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, which represents her guilty conscience for crimes she had committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after being reminded or contemplating about unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to use hand washing equipment more often.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such a practice are less likely to participate in other "cleansing" retaliatory measures, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing and the use of water rather than soap to wash hands are part of the ritual of hand washing, which is represented in many religions including Baha'i, Hinduism, Tawaf and Nitshila Yadaim in Judaism, Bazoo in Christianity, and Bazoo in Islam. Religions also recommend hand hygiene after certain tasks.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam all recommend hand washing before and after every meal.
Control of COVID-19 risks in the workplace.
Controlling COVID-19 risks in the workplace means using safe hygiene practices to control risks in order to prevent 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The appropriate control of workplace risks depends on the workplace and the type of job, and should be based on an assessment of the sources of risk, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations that are less at risk have less contact with the general public and other co-workers and are recommended to take basic prevention measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, observing respiratory etiquette, and maintaining daily hygiene and disinfection of the workplace.
Medium-risk occupations include those where employees require frequent or close contact with people who are not or are not suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but may become infected due to the ongoing spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel.
This includes those who are in contact with the general public, for example in schools, in high-density workplaces and in some high-volume retail outlets.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation through high efficiency air filters, sneezing protectors and wearing personal protective equipment in the event of contact with a person with COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health care workers who are exposed to contact with people with or suspected of having COVID-19 to be at high risk. They are at very high risk if they are engaged in activities that result in the production of airborne particles or if they collect, transport or handle samples from people with or suspected of having COVID-19.
Methods to control the risk to these individuals include engineering controls such as the creation of negative pressure ventilation chambers and the use of personal protective equipment appropriate to the job role.
The outbreak of COVID-19 can have a variety of effects on the workplace.
Employees may be absent due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Business patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are needed and how those goods are accessed (such as buying at off-peak hours, or buying through home delivery services or car-sharing).
Finally, the transport of goods from geographical areas that are heavily affected by COVID-19 could be stopped.
These programs address the risk associated with different workplaces and occupational tasks, including sources of exposure to disease, risk factors from the home and community environment, and individual risk factors for employees, such as aging or chronic illnesses.
It also describes the control measures necessary to address those risks, as well as possible plans to deal with situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
The preparation and planning needed to respond to infectious diseases may be subject to national or local recommendations.
The goals of the outbreak response include reducing employee-to-employee transmission, protecting those who are most at risk of health side effects, preserving business operations, and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the areas where business activities are carried out affects the decisions made.
The hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to classify hazard controls according to their effectiveness.
The most effective control methods for excluding COVID-19 risks are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control methods involve keeping employees away from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution that can be implemented.
Management controls involve changes in the policy or procedures implemented by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative control methods, but can partially prevent exposure to the virus.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the hazards to employees, installed correctly (e.g. respirators), worn consistently and properly, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as necessary, removed properly, cleaned and stored properly or discarded to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with lower exposure to risk have less occupational contact with the general public and their co-workers.
Basic precautions recommended for infection prevention in all work environments include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, observing respiratory etiquette including covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, preparing paper towels and trash cans, preparing to work remotely or in alternating shifts if necessary, encouraging employees not to use other people's tools and equipment, and cleaning and disinfecting the work environment regularly.
The early identification and isolation of potentially infected people is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay at home as long as they are free from fever, symptoms of fever and other symptoms of illness for at least 24 hours without the use of fever reducers or other symptom-modifying drugs, and that leave policies should be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and employees should be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with a medium-level risk include occupations where employees require frequent or close contact to within six feet (1.8 meters) of people who are not infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but may become infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the ongoing spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel in areas where COVID-19 is widespread.
These are employees who are in contact with the general public, for example in places such as schools, workplaces with high population density, and some busy retail outlets. Engineering controls for these and higher risk groups may include installing high-power air filters, increasing ventilation, installing physical barriers such as plastic sneeze guards, and installing self-service windows for customers. Administrative controls for these and higher risk groups include: encouraging sick employees to stay home, replacing meetings with virtual communication, creating rotating shifts, not taking non-essential travel to areas at risk of COVID-19, developing emergency communication plans including creating a skin-care association for responding to concerns of employees, training employees on COVID-19 risk factors and protective measures, training workers who require a limited level of personal protective equipment such as sneakers, and providing a minimum level of personal hygiene and protection to the public, by providing regular access to workplace protective equipment, by installing face masks or handcuffs, and by taking other measures to protect the public from exposure to COVID-19.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use a respirator.
If someone on board becomes ill, appropriate measures to protect staff and other passengers may include keeping the sick person 6 feet away from others, assigning only one crew member to attend to the patient and providing the patient with a face mask, or asking the patient to cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or when in contact with contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and should wear additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biohazard bag and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control includes postponing travel in case of illness, personal quarantine, and immediate notification to the on-board medical centre in case of fever or other symptoms while traveling.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the quarantined person's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, if an infected person entered the school building without regard to community outbreaks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends closing the facility for a short period of time for cleaning or disinfection.
If there is low or moderate community transmission, the following measures can be implemented to maintain social distancing: canceling scientific tours, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education classes or choirs or eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, separating entry and exit times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
When the risk of community transmission is significant, long-term closure of schools should be considered in addition to social distancing measures.For law enforcement personnel performing their daily activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers them to be low immediate health risk.
Law enforcement officers who need to be in contact with people with or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same instructions as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, staff should clean and disinfect their belts and equipment using household cleaning spray or hand towels before reuse, while following standard procedures for the use and disposal of used personal protective equipment (PPE) and washing clothes.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health care workers to be among those most at risk.
High-risk occupations include healthcare, support, laboratory, and medical transportation workers who are exposed to people with or suspected of having COVID-19.
Employees whose work involves the production of airborne particles or who collect, transport or handle samples from people infected or suspected of having COVID-19 are at very high risk.
Activities that result in the production of airborne particles include intubation, coughing, bronchoscopy, and some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling of the patient.
The occupations at very high risk include workers who are engaged in the preparation of the remains of people who have died with or suspected of having COVID-19. The level of risk is very high if dissections are performed. Additional engineering control methods for this group include the creation of isolation rooms for patients with or suspected of having COVID-19, including when doing work that leads to the production of airborne particles.
Negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate for some health care facilities.
Patient samples should be handled with consideration of level 3 biometric precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that newly admitted patients be kept in a designated and segregated waiting room if they are suspected to have COVID-19. In addition to the use of other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends the use of a respirator for those working within 6 feet of a patient with or suspected of having COVID-19, as well as for those doing work that results in the production of airborne particles.
In the United States, use of the N95 respirator is approved by NIOSH and subject to a comprehensive respiratory protection program and protocol that includes appropriate testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and are more convenient for employees to use. The World Health Organization does not recommend full body coverings because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks only for screening at entry points.
The WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles, or face shields, handguns, and gloves for people who collect respiratory samples from patients or care for or transport COVID-19 patients and do not do anything that leads to the production of airborne particles.
If a work is performed during which airborne particulates are produced, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the inadequate global supply of personal protective equipment, WHO recommends the following to minimize the need for personal protective equipment: performing medical examinations in person, creating physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing access to rooms only to those directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, using personal protective equipment only for specific tasks, using a respirator when caring for multiple patients who all have the same disease, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and not using a mask for those who do not have symptoms.

This moon we see ourselves in remarkable circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that clearly highlights the global connectedness of human beings and our responsibilities to each other.
The challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response depends on the compassion, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The companionship and level of care we've seen among our colleagues through email, call and chat, represent the incredible people we have the privilege and honor of working with.
I'm so grateful and honored to have all of you as my collaborators.
Last week, someone expressed appreciation for what we do.
They reminded me of how important it is that the world can now refer to Wikipedia, and how powerful a sign it is that this important resource can be made available online and to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you're keeping sites up to date or our partners are getting paid or our communities are safe.
The world, now more than ever, needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
It's a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making significant adjustments to the way we do our work together starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robin noted earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and plan for the days and months ahead.
In the course of that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was the appropriate response to what we were facing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable in the meantime.
We wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to cut back, that's fine.
To all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Until further notice, we expect to work four hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We're not suspending -- if you can work more normal hours, you're worth the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you're looking after a loved one, buying food, or seeing a doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should go without saying, but we're saying it.
There's no need to take a leave of absence or personal leave - just tell your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules and make sure someone has key tasks covered.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, please inform Bryan at T&C so that T&C can help you and ensure that your condition is being managed properly.)
The hourly wage is paid in full.
As we've said before, we're sticking to our commitments to contractors and employees who work on an hourly basis.
All employees are paid on the basis of normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes you even if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to release their stress into the world around us.
What we do, especially in times like these, can be very valuable.
Again, this is about your own self-care.
We would like you to contact your manager so that we know what to expect and can plan accordingly.
Some things are considered necessary.
There are things we have to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety, and Capital Raising (and others) teams do essential and important work that may need additional support.
We will begin a process with other departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus towards supporting those essential to our mission.
There's a lot of work for all of us, and we're all going to focus on the most basic projects.
If we slow down now, we won't be harmed later.
We don't have a plan to work twice as hard as we do now to get things done as soon as the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are not possible now.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timelines as necessary.
How's the APP?
To match the new realities and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust our schedule for the 2021-2020 annual delivery schedule.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2020-2019 schedule that gives us more time to budget and allows employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones, while allowing those who need or want to work fewer hours to do so over the next few weeks.
This extension reduces the amount of stress on current work schedules across the organization to a great extent.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and, once it is approved, we will inform delegates and teams on the next steps.
Thank you to the annual planning team for leading the way.
Office condition, exposure to disease and cleaning.
Last week, we learned that a SF-based colleague may have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, as a precaution, we hired a virus-cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used the hospital's first-rate antiretroviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator that leads to our floor.
The building has its own care protocol and uses products that are beneficial to the health of its residents.
We'll make sure the office is well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, and they have shared their COVID-19 protocol with us and all the staff based in DC.
As per San Francisco State's guidelines, as of last week, our Washington DC office has been converted into a completely remote facility.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we've also been talking about renting a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions will continue, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Former colleagues who work with us remotely know that this can be a match and want to give you advice:
Limit meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider how they can be held over several days.
Make the meeting clear, have an agenda, and send the study materials in advance.
Set up video by default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and communication.
Assign someone to lead the meeting, someone to oversee the chat to follow up on questions and speaker lists, and someone to take notes (or joint notes).
If you need a handy headset, email the technical support team.
Use your health allowance for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk about shared work with your colleagues.
The Human Resources Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support increased distributed work across the foundation.
Last week we asked all recipients of grants at the foundation level, such as editathon, to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia until the WHO has declared the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellation of programs and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out the agreed activities related to receiving financial benefits and that no one will be punished for delaying or modifying their goals.
Next week we'll be providing more guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional social gatherings.
There seems to be a general feeling across the global community, both sadness because of these disruptions and at the same time a sense of relief because of their transparency and ability to focus on the activities of their own communities, Wikimedia, etc.
As we go forward, the CRT is trying to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor impacts and keep us in touch with them.
Keeping in touch about COVID-19 issues
For the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC to 07:00 PT, we will send out a meeting invitation for special staff to your calendars.
We'll use this time to share more information, answer your questions, and spend some time in touch.
We're all in this together, and we're here to help you in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can find information via this email and other COVID-19 related information on Office Wiki.
The CRT updates these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
We are also working to establish regular contact with those of our employees who are residents of countries that are already significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, news coverage or any other challenge you may need help with, please feel free to inform and collaborate with CRT.
We're here to help and support you if you need it.
If you would like to discuss a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - International Human Resources Operations Manager.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and our commitments.
It's just that it suggests that at this moment our work and our commitments are probably going to require adaptation in ways that we haven't had in the past.
These are steps that we believe are essential to support each other so that we can continue to do our work and support our movement and provide the services that the world depends on.
The things we planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for the important work that is going to be done in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we ask that you take care of yourself and your families so that you can be at your best when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The team includes Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, lungs, heart, kidney, and intestine.
ACE2 interferes with the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing (Ang1-7), which has made it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of this enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a carrier domain of the C-terminal amino acid colchicine.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I whose enzyme-active domain is located adjacent to the surface of lung and other tissue cells.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the digestive domain by another enzyme called shadas, and the resulting soluble protein is eventually excreted in the urine after entering the bloodstream.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 attaches to the cell membrane of type II plump cells mainly of the lungs, small intestinal enterocytes, endothelial cells of the gallbladder and urethra, and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA signatures are found in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is activity as an ACE inhibitor.
ACE converts the hormone angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
In turn, it separates the amino acid carboxyl-terminal from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to angiotensin G (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can break down a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9]-Brady-Kine, Aplin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane flow of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is implicated in the pathogenesis of Hartnap disease.
ACE2, as the transition protein, plays the role of the main entry point for some coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (the SARS virus), and SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus).
More importantly, the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 adheres to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface, leading to intracellular localization and migration of the virus and enzyme into the intracellular endosomes.
This entry process involves preparation of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 serine protease host, the inhibition of which is being investigated as a potential treatment in ongoing research.
However, professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended that treatment with standard ACE inhibitors and ARBs be continued.
A meta-analysis and regular review published on 11 July 2012 found that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls.
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those who had suffered a stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was associated with reduced pneumonia deaths, although the results were weaker compared to the overall pneumonia probability results.
It is suspected that human reverse ACE (rhACE2) is a novel treatment for acute lung injury and has apparently improved respiratory haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by saccarid lipopoly.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, with an onset of action of 30 minutes plus a duration of action of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with sensitivity to systemic and classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RSA inhibitors) or circulating factor II angiotensin-enhancing diseases.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications used for contact tracing during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Several programs have been developed or proposed that have the support of government authorities in some territories and regions.
Several frameworks have been developed for providing call tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly in systems based on the geolocation of app users.
Less intrusive solutions include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would include Bluetooth-based app support directly on Android and iOS.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to find out if they have had contact with people with COVID-19.
It's been used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, it's using an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source, and will be handed over to the government.Northern Macedonia has released a Bluetooth-based app called "StopKorona!" to track possible contacts of infected people and provide immediate response to healthcare referrals.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the contact tracing program is in advanced development and will be ready to deploy in a few weeks.
Both Australia and Zeland are considering programs based on the TraceTogether program and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to introduce a geo-containment program for COVID-19 patients and residents of Moscow to prevent them from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has pointed out a number of practical problems with app-driven systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies when the app is used in small population samples.
Apple, in its review of problems with the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus apps", has placed restrictions on the types of organizations that are allowed to add coronavirus apps to the App Store, allowing only "official" or "authentic" organizations to do so.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of public surveillance using coronavirus apps, and specifically stated that it is unclear whether the surveillance infrastructure created for the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this kind of surveillance.
These organizations have listed eight conditions for government initiatives:
The monitoring must be legal, necessary and proportionate;
Monitoring and monitoring devices must have an auto-cancel function;
data use should be limited to COVID-19 cases;
Data security and anonymity must be guaranteed and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should not be a basis for intensifying discrimination and isolation;
The transfer of data to third parties must be within the framework of the law;
Guarantees should be provided to prevent abuse and the right of citizens to report abuse;
The targeted participation of all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and fringe groups, is essential.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published lists.
The Google/Apple proposal aims to address the continuous monitoring problem by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems, once the need is removed.
In some countries, the network-centric location process has been used instead of the app, and as a result, the need to download the app and the ability to escape tracking has been eliminated.
In Israel, grid-based tracking is adopted.
Network-centric solutions that access raw location data may violate privacy.
However, not all systems with a central server require access to personal location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems use central servers only for internal communications (see section below).
In South Korea, an unprogrammed system was used to track contacts.
Rather than using a specialized program, the system would collect tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and use it to send SMS notifications to people who might be infected.
In addition to using this information to communicate with potential audiences, the government is making location information publicly available.This type of disclosure has been allowed due to widespread changes in data protection laws in the wake of the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is publicly available through a number of apps and websites. Some countries, such as Germany, have adopted centralized systems and privacy-preserving measures.
As of 6 April 2020, these details have not yet been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracing is an accepted concept with documented research dating back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, dozens of expert groups were working on privacy-preserving strategies, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that incorporates centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a stand-alone protocol. Of the decentralized protocols, one can point to the privacy-preserving decentralized close call (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the temporary contact numbers (TCN, also known as call event numbers, CEN), the privacy-sensitive protocols, and the mobile call recording protocol (PACT).
In these protocols, personal identification data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs inside the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving practices in the collection and use of location and routing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform is based on research results from the official report "Programme compliance: Personal privacy during the pandemic", published in March 2020. Another similar initiative is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies developed at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive geographic and health data with other users and authorities without violating data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was formed by a number of groups that came together around what were essentially similar and overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing dispersion and providing a global platform for collaboration on tracking and alerting programs, key aspects of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol, which had been used in its official government program, publicly available.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies controlling the Android and iOS mobile platforms, unveiled a call tracking initiative that they claimed will protect privacy.
They've also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is to be launched in three stages:
Introduce tools to empower governments to create privacy-enabled COVID-19 response programs
Direct integration of the feature in iOS and Android. Google and Apple intend to address the problems of adoption and continuous monitoring by distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing it in a similar fashion after the threat is resolved.
b'Drug substitution (also known as drug diversion, drug modification, drug function modification, or drug therapy diversion) refers to the use of an approved drug to treat a disease or condition that is different from the one for which the drug was originally developed.
This is a line of scientific research being conducted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research goals include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of improved human plasma.
Analysis of these sites of association provides a plausible plan for the development of antiviral drugs effective against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 include the papanin-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP ribophosphatase.

The World Health Organization included lopinavir/ritonavir in an international "cross-over" trial.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections.Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir was active in the laboratory against the viruses Filo, Pnomo, Paramexovirus, and Corona.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutation, which may lead to more severe and infectious diseases.
Some preliminary pre-clinical studies suggest that remdesivir may be an effective genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by the Cleveland Teaching Hospital, one involving people with mild disease and the other involving people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials are underway on the efficacy of intravenous vitamin C administration to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, two of which are drug-controlled (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

There are also trials in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'vaccine COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it does not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available any sooner than 18 months from now.
Five proposed vaccines were undergoing Phase I immunity studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A global pandemic occurred in 2020 and led to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the released genomes to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was announced that the CEPI's vaccine development requirements include speed, production capacity, scale deployment and global availability.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms are under development in early 2020 to produce an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The primary platform targets included in the Phase I immunoassay studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (proposed Phase I developer and vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
The virus carrier (developer of phase I and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, carrier of adenovirus type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 proposed vaccines are in early stages of development, 78 of them approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others have been made public but information about many of them is not publicly available (assuming they are in planning or design).
Phase I-II trials investigate pre-exposure and immunization, usually randomised and controlled with a pharmacologist, at various sites and determine more precise and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants than a control group and monitor adverse events at the optimal dose while also evaluating the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing disease.
Of 79 proposed vaccines in active development (approved as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in preclinical research).
On or about January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the feasibility of a molecular vaccine for genetic modification of viral proteins and simulation of immune response.

On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it would be discontinuing its partnership with Novavax in the
The vaccine development and manufacturing division has announced.
The partners later announced that they would complete the pre-clinical trial and the Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was testing on 11 people in quarantine and that the development of a vaccine would take at least one and a half to two years at the very least.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, announced the development of a coronavirus-like virus funded in part by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine proposal is in the laboratory research phase and human trials are scheduled to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier in the week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac to provide exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine in exchange for a 'large sum of money' that the German government had opposed.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a collaboration with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
A proposed mRNA-based vaccine, called BNT162, is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are scheduled to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that the results of their pre-clinical trials would be ready by April 2020, and their proposed final vaccine could be tested on humans before the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Pandemic Prevention (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.With this investment, the total capital for the development of COVID-19 vaccines reached $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different proposed vaccines on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-boosting RNA vaccine to combat COVID-19.
The proposed vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence data from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced that it had allocated C$275 million to fund 96 COVID-19 response research projects, including several vaccine proposals at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan projects.
At around the same time, the Government of Canada announced that it had allocated C$192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and was planning to create a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines, with the potential to be used in the event of further outbreaks of the coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a proposed COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and announced that "the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines with MNA eliminated strong antigen-specific antigen responses [in mice] that had been detected 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a proposed DNA-based vaccine, possibly in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophage agents, this DNA will be engineered to replicate inside human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles. This process stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities merged resources to access IBM's supercomputers as well as the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have asymptomatic effects or adverse effects.
That means they may have benefits beyond disease prevention.
Another randomized trial in Australia is set to enroll 4,170 active healthcare providers.
Vaccines in the development stage may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicate the need for Level 3 biosecurity precautions to work with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine to treat or prevent SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
During the MERS outbreak, it was thought that ongoing MERS research would likely provide a useful template for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that had passed phase I clinical trials in humans and three other vaccines that were all carriers of the virus. There were also two adenovirus carriers (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA carrier vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
The views posted on social media have promoted a conspiracy theory about the knownness of the COVID-19 virus and the existence of a vaccine for it.
The inventions mentioned on various social media refer to previous inventions related to genetic sequences and vaccines related to other types of coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.
b'2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a type of infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The common symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of hearing, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure to the pathogen and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some cases result in viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported worldwide from 210 countries and territories, with 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly transmitted by close contact, often through small droplets from coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although this emission causes these droplets to be scattered, droplets usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than being transported over long distances.
People can become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, and mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The probability of transmission is higher in the first three days after the onset of symptoms. However, there is also the possibility of viral transmission before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the instantaneous reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of being infected with the virus and their surroundings.
Recommendations for the general public to wear masks vary; some officials are against, others are in favor, and some consider it mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may have no symptoms or may have symptoms similar to influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Urgent symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, dizziness, difficulty walking, and bruising of the face or lips. If these symptoms do not resolve, you should see a doctor immediately.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as cough, runny nose, or sore throat, have also been reported less commonly.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed at varying rates.
Some cases in China had only shortness of breath and severe heart palpitations in the initial stage.
In others, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and even death.
This is called the dormant period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms become evident within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in the transmission process is not yet well understood.
The proportion of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown and under review. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospital admissions.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its statistics on 1 April.
Both the mice and the saliva may be carriers of the virus.
Talking out loud disperses more particles than speaking slowly.
Singaporean researchers have shown that not covering the mouth and nose during coughing can cause the release of small droplets up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has stated that airborne transmission is possible and that positive samples of viral RNA have been detected in air collectors installed in the hallway outside the patient's room.
Certain medical procedures such as tubing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released and the virus to be spread through the air.
While there are concerns about fecal transmission, this is assumed to be low. The probability of transmission is higher in symptomatic people. The probability of transmission is low before symptoms appear.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that although the transmission mechanism is not clear, each person usually infects two to three people.
Specifically, the virus survives for one day on cardboard, for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper.
Of course, this depends on the humidity and temperature.
Proper use of soap and detergent is also effective. Soap products remove the protective layer of fat from the virus, inactivating it and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical fluid), are less effective.In the study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
Five of the six patients had the first sample showing high viral load, and the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory group in Wuhan.
All symptoms of novel SARS-CoV-2 are seen in coronaviruses of related nature.
The virus is eliminated outside the human body by household soap. Soap destroys its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 affects the lungs most as the virus enters the host cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in type II pulmonary cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called spike (pylomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart failure was observed in 12% of those infected and hospitalized in Wuhan.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders is high in the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in cardiac activity.
A higher incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been reported in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with poor diagnosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 tends to be associated with ACE2-containing epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, signs of severe systemic inflammation have been seen in patients with COVID-19.
In particular, the association of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells with inflammatory IL-6 secreting monocytes absorption and severe pulmonary pathology has been established in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltration has also been reported during autopsies.
WHO has published several protocols for testing this disease.
The standard method of diagnosis is the reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on breath samples obtained with a nasopharynx swab. Of course, a nasal swab or a mixed sample is also applicable.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence, allowing laboratories around the world to independently run polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect viral infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and a person's history of infection) were under study but not widely used.
This Chinese experiment is only 60 to 70 percent accurate in the field.
The first point-of-care test was approved by the US FDA on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.The diagnostic guidelines of the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for diagnosing infection based on clinical features and epidemiologic risk.
The multi-lobular, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution of the two-lobular matrix is useful for early detection of infection.
Subcutaneous overgrowth, defective cover (slab lesions of the bladder with variable apical enlargement) and rigidity may be signs of disease progression.
There is not much information on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The most important pathological findings in anatomy are:
Macroscopic: the rib cage, the pericardium, the heart muscle and the respiratory system.
Four levels of viral pneumonia are observed:
Mild pneumonia: respiratory edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, abnormal large pneumocytes, inflammation of the intestine with lymphocyte infiltration and the formation of large multi-cell cells
Acute pneumonia: diffuse adenocarcinoma (DAD) with diffuse adenocarcinoma discharge, also known as diffuse adenocarcinoma.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Improving pneumonia: formation of secretions in the bronchial cavities and respiratory fibrosis
Blood: dispersed intravascular coagulation (DIC); locuriotroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing, and using the inside of the elbow if a towel is not available.
Hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places to some extent to prevent the spread of disease by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are pursued to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups of people through the closure of schools and workplaces, restrictions on travel, and cancellation of large gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include keeping at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) between people.
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Since vaccine discovery is not expected until at least 2021, an important part of the COVID-19 management process is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, or 'flatten the curve'.
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This is especially important after using the toilet or after obvious contamination of the hands, before eating, and after clearing the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% if water and soap are not available.For areas where conventional hand sanitizers are not available, the WHO has provided two formulations for local production.
In these formulas, the antimicrobial agent is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove the microbial stain alcohol; it is not an effective hand sanitizer.
Glycerol is added as a moisture preservative.
Individuals are managed with supportive care that may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs that are damaged.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected wear a simple mask.
External-membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under investigation.
Personal hygiene and lifestyle changes and family dietary changes are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive care may be beneficial for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have provided recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Special care physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled the treatment recommendations of various institutions into a free resource called the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptom relief, some medical professionals have found the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to be better than ibuprofen for first-line administration.
To minimize the possibility of transmission of the virus, it is essential to take precautions, especially in treatment settings where procedures that produce suspended particles, such as piping or manual ventilation, are performed.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the person in an AIIR and using standard precautions, contact prevention and air precautions.The CDC has published guidelines for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Proposed equipment includes: PPE, respirator or face mask, eye protection and surgical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved the use of these masks with an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The mask is designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but its effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for use outside of the main application.
If a mask is not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, handmade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternative procedures, but a percentage of them do.
Respiratory support for people with COVID-19 respiratory failure is being studied in people in hospital. Some evidence suggests that tubal insertion can be prevented by a high-flow cannula from the nose or by a positive pressure in the airway.
Whether either of these two approaches leads to similar benefits in terminally ill patients is not yet clear.
Some physicians prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, as it limits the dispersion of fine particles compared to the upstream nasal cannula. The prevalence of severe cases is higher in the elderly (people over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
In many developed countries, per capita hospital beds are insufficient, limiting the capacity of health systems to manage the sudden increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
In a study in China, 5% of patients were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is exacerbated in COVID-19 and oxygen delivery becomes much more difficult.
To maximize oxygen delivery and reduce the risk of lung injury associated with the ventilator and the chest, it is essential to use the ventilator with high pressure control and PPEP modes.
Older breathing apparatus may not have high PEEP.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir is apparently the most promising of the drugs.
While the development of new drugs will take until 2021, several of the investigational drugs are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
An antiviral medication may be tested in people with severe illness.
The WHO has proposed that volunteers participate in trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of potential drugs.The FDA has granted a temporary license for the use of transcriptional plasma as an experimental treatment, but only in cases where the risk to life is very high or very high.
The drug has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove efficacy and safety associated with the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
It can identify 'closest contacts' using surveillance data and identify the likelihood of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is identified, the app reports the issue to local health authorities in addition to suggesting home quarantine.High-level analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence have been used to track infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track cellphone data of suspected COVID-19 cases.
This was done to impose quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also provided the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated phone location data from German federal government agencies to allow research into the patterns of the virus and its prevention.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
Giulio Gallera, the Italian regional health officer, was informed by mobile operators that 40% of people are still moving around freely.
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend, with over 42,000 people participating.
Also, Kersti Kaljulaid, the President of Estonia, issued a call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection may cause stress.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic problems can transform people's mental and physical health".
The disease may be asymptomatic or asymptomatic in some stages, and may cause complications similar to other common diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, but those with severe or acute illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at high risk for COVID-19, but there is little information on COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In sick people, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, shock infection, or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include infection, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, kidney, and liver failure.
Blood clotting abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of people hospitalized for COVID-19, with a prevalence of renal failure in 4% of these people.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have symptoms of increased secretion of the liver enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were related to hospitalization.
However, in patients transferred to the ICU, the average time between hospitalization and death was reported to be seven days.
Recent case studies have shown that the median time between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days reported.
Studies by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China showed that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women 1.7%.
Tissue-anesthesia examinations of lung samples from deceased individuals show dispersed pulmonary lesions and cellular fibromyoxide secretions in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung was similar to that of a person with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, increased troponin levels or heart attack were caused by cardiac injury.
According to March data in the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region also affect the death rate.
Estimates of the number of deaths from the disease vary due to regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
The low number of mild cases may have led to an overestimation of the fatality rate.
Of course, the fact that the deaths were the result of previous infections may mean that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require special care or diet compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority reports a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovered from illness and the presence of organ damage on lung scans.
This may lead to post-recovery special-care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether a history of infection would cause effective long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunisation is supported by the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but in some cases the coronavirus has also been tested positive in people recovering from COVID-19.
It is believed that these cases are due to the worsening of latent infection and not the re-infection.
It is thought to be a naturally occurring virus of animal origin, spread by infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but until December 2019, the prevalence of this infection was almost entirely based on human-to-human transmission.
A review of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 dates the first case of symptomatic transmission back to 1 December 2019.
The official WHO publication dates the first reported cases of symptoms to December 8, 2019.
Various metrics are commonly used to measure mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, quality of healthcare systems, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global death rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case-fatality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease that die from it. The infectious fatality rate (IFR) is another measure that determines the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from the stage of infection to the closure of the case.
Although not all infected individuals necessarily produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of infected individuals.
In the small village of Castiglione d'Adda, with a population of 4,600, the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, 80 (1.7%) people died.
Gangelt, the disease spread through Carnival festivals. Infecting young people resulted in relatively low mortality rates. However, some deaths from COVID-19 have not been officially categorized as deaths from the virus.
And the German health system has maintained its efficiency.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people, based on blood donor evaluations, may have produced antibodies.
69 cases (0.004% of the population) of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 have been recorded.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates differ between women and men.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate was reported to be higher in men.
Men are most likely to develop it after age 50. This gap between women and men disappears by age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The reasons for this sex difference are unclear, but genetic and behavioral factors may play a role.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, and higher incidence of male concomitant diseases such as hypertension at younger ages than women may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government has not taken any action to track gender-related data on COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that COVID-19 was chosen as the official name of the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, announced that the CO acronym is coronavirus, VI is the virus, D is the abbreviation for disease, and 19 is the date it was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographical locations (such as China), animal species or groups of people, based on international naming proposals and to avoid labeling. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) CoV-2.
WHO also uses the titles COVID-19 and COVID-19 in official communications.
The disease and its virus are collectively called coronavirus.
In the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the name Covid and Wuhan coronavirus were co-signed to the virus and the disease.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization considered 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory illness as provisional names for the disease.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are moving to the production of sanitary items such as nasal swabs and machine parts.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital needed a fan-supporting device and the supplier could not provide it on time, so a local startup reverse-engineered and produced 100 fans overnight.
After the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incomplete information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and rapidly spread online.
The virus appears to be transmitted from humans to some animals.
Studies have found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is ongoing among government agencies, scientific groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO launched a "unity trial" to assess the therapeutic efficacy of four of the most promising existing antiviral compounds.
There is no vaccine yet, but various institutions are actively exploring proposed vaccines.
Previous SARS-CoV studies are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under research.
First, researchers are working on a complete vaccine against the virus.
The use of the virus, either inactivated or dead, is aimed at preventing the human body from having an immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, is pursued with the goal of creating a vaccine that can make the immune system more sensitive to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study relies on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is related to nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new way of making vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of each of these strategies should be evaluated for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine was started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code that has been copied from the virus that causes the disease.
As of April 2020, there were over 300 active clinical trials.
Seven clinical trials evaluated previously approved therapies for the treatment of malaria, including four projects on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The antiviral drugs are the subject of a major Chinese research study, which is expected to conclude nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, clinical dynamics of COVID-19 vaccine development and proposed drugs are under review. Several antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, cloroquine and hydroxycloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta.
Until March 2020, there was inconclusive evidence of the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with unlicensed remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China, and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, and preliminary results were published.
Of course, the research community is invited to critique these results.
Korean and Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily intake of 1 gram, has stated that a double dose is very dangerous and may be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, with the advice of treating physicians for COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high-dose ribavirin is necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from replicating in the laboratory environment.
Nitrosoxanide, after its low-concentration efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication was demonstrated, has been proposed for human research. Studies have shown that preparing primary spike protein with trans membrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to enter via interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with/without azithromycin has major limitations that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further investigation.
Cytokine storms may be severe complications of later stages of COVID-19.
Evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine has anti-cytokine storm properties. The Chinese National Health Commission has included tocilizumab in the treatment guidelines after a brief review.
After the drug had shown positive results in patients with severe disease, it was put into a nationwide phase 2 randomised trial in Italy.
A combination of serum ferritin blood test to detect cytokine storms is used to combat this development, which has been reported to be the cause of death in some infected individuals.
The FDA approved interleukin-6 receptor antagonists based on case studies for the treatment of cytokine-resistant release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, no randomized and controlled evidence of the efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of CRS has been presented.
Transmission of pure and concentrated antibodies produced in the immune system of people recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it is being investigated as a non-vaccine method with inactivation.
This strategy was tested for SARS, and the results were inconclusive.
Viral inactivation is a possible mechanism for this, whereby inactivated antibodies provide a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other mechanisms, such as antigen-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be effective.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are being investigated.
The production of the serum, which consists of a liquid portion of blood taken from the recovered individuals and contains specific antibodies to this virus, may be increased to develop more rapidly.
CoV disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan Central Hospital, later died from COVID-19 after publicly reporting the outbreak.
