This not only confirms a widely known hypothesis that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils cannot, such as color or three-dimensional structure.
Scientists believe that the fur of this species is chestnut brown on top and grayish-blue or yellow/orange on the bottom.
The discovery also provides a glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
"Because the feathers of dinosaurs lacked a well-developed hairy trunk called the tubular trunk but had other features of feathers - fur and hair - researchers suggested that the tubular trunk may have been a later evolutionary development with these other characteristics".
The structure of the feathers suggests that the feathers were not used for flight but for body temperature control or for display. The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen exhibits an adult plumage rather than a silky plumage.
The researchers say that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult bird and not a chicken.

In France, voting has long been a low-tech task: each voter goes to a separate ballot box, leaving a pre-printed piece of paper with the name of the candidate they have chosen in an envelope.
After the staff verifies the identity of the voter, the voter will put the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter list.

Deputy Chief Inspector D K Arya said: "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop".
The accused suspects are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commander Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver survived with a severe head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was later convicted in the Edinburgh District Court for the murder of his son.
She is currently in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all witness evidence could be destroyed because her image has been widely published.
This practice is common in England but it's different in Scotland, where the law and the courts have held that the distribution of the images is likely to cause prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University noted that "journalists may be really taking a dangerous path in publishing images, etc. of suspects".
The prosecutor's office, in charge of the prosecution, has told reporters that there will be no comment at least until the prosecution is brought to justice.
The document, according to the leak, would refer to a border conflict, which Palestine wanted to settle on the lines of the pre-1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of spiritual Jerusalem with both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demanded the continuation of the military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement was signed while the Palestinian Authority agreed to a presence for only five years.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control trial were closely monitored by the forestry officers because the trial program was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
As part of the partnership agreement between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's recruitment program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of the NPWS Parks and Heritage Conservation Authority, the four shooters selected for the first shoot were trained and comprehensively instructed on safety principles.
Martelly was sworn into the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth Election Commission Martelly has established in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission requested the former provisional electoral council (CEP) to resign as part of a package of measures to move the country to a new electoral cycle.
The order was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests since October.
These sometimes violent protests stem from the failure of elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod portable music players experiencing overheating, causing a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified them of 34 additional heat-related incidents that the company said were "not serious".
In response to the announcement, the department called the delay in Apple's reporting a "greatly regrettable event".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 a.m. GMT, Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency says there are no reports of casualties in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took several Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking a bus carrying them in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the visitors with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead.
As with the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly woman when she needed the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During her time at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in her spare time.
His research shows that if a hormone is injected, the rate of lung growth in the fetus is accelerated.
Xinhua reports that government investigators recovered two black boxes from the plane on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also showed their gratitude to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says, "Luna was the First Queen of Extremes, my first manager, Luna went out on a moonlit night, unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as scary as I am...maybe more...I love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Among 1,400 people who took part in the 2010 federal election poll, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic rose by 8% from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign said she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
According to the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but according to his complaint, his fitness is not guaranteed.
He can't take pain medication because it's been banned from the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper is a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, who discovered the largest number of elements ever known on January 25.
Some people verified the discovery with various hardware and software in early February and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have once been a source of water for the Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, and especially Earth, formed because of the impact of comets that struck Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year, signing a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political chatter and folly".
There was a rumor that he was running for president in 2016.
NextGen is the system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses a satellite-based technology as opposed to a multi-surface-based technology that allows the air traffic controller to position the aircraft with higher accuracy and allows the pilot to provide more accurate information.
No additional vehicles were deployed and the ground train would not stop at Wembley and there were no car parks and shuttle buses in the area.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study was published in the journal Science on Thursday on the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
According to reports by researchers from Princeton University, USA and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations although this process is thought to have taken much longer, due to a combination of Darwin's sparrow, the Geospiza species, and the Geospiza migratory bird.
Gold can be machined into all shapes. It can be crafted into objects of very small size.
It can be pulled into thin threads to be twisted and re-woven.
It can be very thinly plated and coated on other metals, and it can be so thinly plated that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called glittering manuscripts.
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make a pointer with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color according to the acid or base (alkaline) concentration of the chemical.
The pH is indicated by the number of Hydro ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ion is the proton that has had its electron removed (since the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Fold two pieces of dry flour together, then press them into a block with wet, clean hands.
"The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers that feel strange and mold into a kind of shell".
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home has a water pipe that connects to a complex sewer system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes part of a public bath where men and women shared.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space pick up the call and then bounce it back down, almost instantly.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and visual images.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in an incredible way, and the greatest thing that the bicycle has brought to life is that it has made it possible for us to move around and to get around much easier and much faster.
It has given us trains, cars, and other forms of transportation.
Lower down are the medium-sized cat family, whose prey ranges from rabbits to elk and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat small prey in large numbers such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the hook, a special job that each cat has to avoid competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called herds.
The flock consists of one to three adult males related to each other along with about thirty of their offspring and offspring.
"Women tend to be closely related to each other in a family of sisters and daughters".
Lions herds act like wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very dangerous to prey.
Like an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump, and pull with five times the pull of a healthy human.
The tiger is grouped with the lion, the leopard, and the panther, and these four families are the only families of cats that can purr.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but like a series of rumbles in its throat.
Ocelots eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible. Most of the animals that the Ocelot catches are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that South American forest cats track and find prey by scent, sniffing out every place the prey has been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move with great subtlety, no one knows.
When a small number of organisms separate from the main population (such as when they move across a mountain range or river, or to an island far from where they came from so that they are unlikely to return), the group will often be aware of being in a different environment from the one they were in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptive abilities to become a more powerful competitor than they were before.
The original population is completely unchanged, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they began to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they receive the carbonic gas that humans expel (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants and we make clothes from plants, most of our food is from plants, without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mermaid was a top predator during its lifetime, so it was not afraid of anything, except other mermaids.
Its long jaw is equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth and a set of canine teeth in the mouth, meaning that nothing can escape in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a scaly tongue, and its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been carnivorous.
It also attacks everything in the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex are no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans shared exotic or unusual feasts, including wild boar, ducks, lizards, and a rodent called the squirrel.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on benches to eat, the rich enjoyed having parties together and lying down to eat.
Ancient Roman meals did not appear to be the food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't eat pork, tomato, potato, cacao, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each god and viewed the place as his home.
People would bring offerings to the gods, and the monks would try to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an outer courtyard and an inner temple that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes towers with a special pyramidal shape, called a ziggurat, were built as part of temples.
The tower is a special shrine to the gods.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not so important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their time living outdoors.
Women cooking in the yard; newly opened shops looking out onto the street; stone used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the timber was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse legend tells that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and while traveling westward he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Although they are all Scandinavian countries, there are many differences in people, kings, customs and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "The Declaration of Independence Originally dated July 4, 1776". This line appears at the bottom of the text, in reverse order.
Although no one is certain about the authorship of the document, it is known that in the early days, this large goatskin document (29 3⁄4 inches long and 24 1⁄ 2 inches wide) was rolled up for preservation.
So, it's possible that the comment was added to simply as a marker.
The Allied landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France but the south was not yet free.
The area was ruled by the French "Vichy" Government. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had joined hands with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched "Operation Dragoon", invading southern France.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in a collective, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning of the people, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, and it also partly defines the scale of society.
The city-state is the precursor of the nation-state. The culture of civilization contains the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a cultural imprint that has survived and is well-discussed.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence and are not recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a loose central government - with Congress as the sole constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it had to rely on the state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
It also had no authority to amend the tariff laws or the interstate tariff bill.
The statute required consensus from all states before amendment and states disparaged the central government to the extent that state representation was frequently absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, are the second most successful team in the world as the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skateboarding and F1 motorcycle racing.
"Winter sports are most popular in northern regions with Italians competing at international arenas and Olympic events".
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to its cluster/group of islands, Japan is also often referred to as an "island" in geographical terms.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors sailed past and recorded the island as Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began to change the local people's grain-growing habits and hired Chinese workers to work on their rice fields and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) military took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun God, and the Chamber of Three Gates.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to help visitors better visualize their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, the film size that was common before the end of the analog film era.
It's still in production today but more importantly the frame rate is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is a bit confusing.
Thus, the aspect ratio for this format (slicing for twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format sets) are equivalent to or close to this frame rate.
The rule of thirds is often derided and misused as a simple guide to creating dynamics while still being used as a measure of the order of the photograph.
According to this rule, the most useful location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, now rich and powerful, began to be subject to scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has been the link between European nations, despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-powerful influence affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that endowments for the church exist for that purpose.
The central body of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder whether the above-mentioned doctrine was being followed.
After the war broke out, Britain immediately launched a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective through the cutting off of military and civilian supplies, although the blockade has violated widely accepted international law, enshrined by many international agreements over the past two centuries.
He dropped mines in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire ocean area, endangering neutral ships.
There was little response to this tactic, so Germany expected to receive the same response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing view of most citizens and nations was in favor of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the misery and brutality of war through World War I, nations were eager to avoid a future repetition of that situation.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
"He came to America with just four pennies in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison".
Ancient China has a unique way of representing different eras; each Chinese period or each dynasty held power corresponding to a different dynasty.
In addition, there were periods of instability between the dynasties, when the continents were divided, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Tang.
During these times, fierce warfare occurred between many battles between nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died just to claim the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many political and social implications, such as the use of the numeral system, the transition from authoritarian monarchy to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to some ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, the professions opened the door to all men to apply for jobs, helping the most ambitious to succeed.
This is also true in the military, where rank is based on merit rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working classes in many other countries, spurring them to rise up.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He often went to a cave called Hira "on the Mountain of Noor" (the Light) to meditate.
And over time, the Hira's work has preserved the vivid image of the spiritual tendency that Saint Mohamed left behind.
Located on top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists, because once you're in the cave, you're completely isolated.
Nothing but a clear, high sky, a vast mountain range. A small world known and heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to commemorate the fallen pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Tombs" in Egypt's Valley of the Tombs, contains many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and statues of the Great God.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor Khufu's family members and relatives.
The upper line looks like a V and the lower line looks like a spike or square without the lower edge.
Up means you should start at the top of the scale and push the scale up, and down means you should start at the slide (where your hand holds the scale) and push the scale down.
The upper voice usually produces a softer tone, while the lower voice produces a stronger and more decisive tone.
Feel free to mark, but remember that the printed arrows have a musical meaning, so respect them.
On 6 October 1789, while in the Palace of Versailles, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette with their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and her sister - Madam Elizabeth were forced to return to Paris in panic by a crowd of women traders in the market.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a mob shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage window.
One of the crowd has trampled the head of a royal soldier killed at the Palace of Versailles in the face of the terrified queen.
The cost of the war of American imperialism in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover the bulk of their expenses and the interest on floating bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits made from the exploitation of the Filipino people for a long time became the main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar organization, one must understand the context that motivated its birth.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.)
The Medieval period The Middle period follows the Classical period and precedes the Late Middle period, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technical determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technical impulse or the technical compulsion to the narrow sense that human destiny is governed by an implicit system of logic linked to scientific laws and expressed in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism have two ideas in common: that technological development itself follows a particular path, unaffected by culture and politics, and that technology has an "impact" on inherent societies, not conditioned societies.
For example, one could say that motorized cars inevitably led to the development of roads.
However, the national road network was not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The increased car ownership has also led to an increase in traffic accidents, which has led to new medical techniques to repair injuries to the body.
Romanticism had a large cultural determinant, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time the customs and culture associated with that area developed and these combined with social status were still better than the dictatorship imposed by law.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was famous as a hotbed of luxury beginning around 400 BC and lasting until about 1100 AD.
The city's status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders gave back gifts such as silk and spices worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the style in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments that came about as a result of the crusades was that people started to use buttons.
Subsistence farming is the form of agriculture that is carried out solely to provide sufficient food for the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple system, typically consisting of only organic fertilizer, using stored seeds of indigenous varieties that are well suited to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have followed the subsistence agriculture model, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Group culture brings together like-minded individuals who feel alienated by social norms and helps them to feel like they're on the same page.
Subcultures may differ because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The factors that define the culture of different regions may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sex, geography, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a cultural group often express their relationship through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles such as fashion, speech, and tone of voice.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite several unfortunate cases of children involved in neglect, unhappiness, or intentional abuse, with a lack of social contact coming from foster caregivers as the child grows up.
Some of the children are taken into custody (usually by their parents); in some cases, the abandonment is due to the parents' rejection of the severely mentally or physically impaired child.
The wandering child may have been subjected to cruel abuse or trauma before being abandoned or absconding.
Others are thought to be domesticated; some are thought to be solitary in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (to the physical limit) that are almost entirely similar to those of their caregiver, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes one step further.
Modeling is not a learning method but a means to help people who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Teaching can be in real or virtual form, in other words, the teacher is a form of teaching but is like a tiny virtual assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to question, remind, and explain processes that can challenge students to solve problems on their own.
Children are placed in the Alternative Care Unit for a variety of reasons, from indifference to abuse or even abduction.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurtured, cared for and educated, which they are now experiencing.
We found the foster care system to be a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, a stable educational environment, and reliable health care.
A home is considered to provide the essentials that your previous home did not.
The Internet incorporates elements of both community and individual communication.
The peculiarities of the Internet lead to many new aspects of how to use and approach contentment.
For example, learning and socialization have been proposed as important drivers for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Self-engagement and continuous relevance were also seen as new motivations by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated your response to electronic websites.
The use of video cameras has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of transient facial expressions, which are movements that occur within a few milliseconds of the face.
Specifically, it was thought that one could detect someone who was lying by accurately interpreting every tiny expression.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks shows how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain damage can accurately assess honesty.
He even suggests that these capabilities in interpreting human behavior may also be present in other animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: diver and dominant.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection eliminates it from the expression group.
Splitting and re-merging occurs back and forth between the two groups over each generation.
In the desert, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet the demand for essential amino acids from available plant sources.
And in addition, failure to do so can lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The fastest accessible plant source would probably be the protein found in the leaves and the roots of the beans, but they're difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (eels, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide ample protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
So, all things considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to the primates of the steppe today.
Sleep interference is the process of intentionally waking a person during their normal sleep time and falling back asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a virtually silent alarm clock to help you wake up without being fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting your watch when you fall asleep, you can put the watch in a different corner of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
The circadian choices involve drinking lots of water (especially filtered water or tea, which is known as diuretic) before bedtime that will make you want to wake up to urinate.
Inner peace is inversely proportional to the stresses that our bodies and minds experience.
The less stress, the more positive energy there is, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stops us on this path is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is extended by the path of compassion of the great Buddhist monks and many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love.
According to Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Central to Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, fields of pure energy, chakras are initiated and the sense of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. By the end of World War II, the conflict of systems, processes and cultures had caused these countries to split again.
In the two years that followed the end of the war, the former allies were enemies again and the Cold War began.
It's supposed to last for the next 40 years and be fought in real life, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish line was broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian front.
These plans, however, collapsed almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and formed the front lines of Belarus and Ukraine after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way at the present time to transport large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
The traditional mission of the navy is to ensure the maintenance of the nation's transportation of people and goods, while interfering with the movement of enemy troops and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, in which the United States attempted to transport supplies and troops across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy also used U-boats to try to stop the flow.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain after having conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep these animals for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
The deer were often reared in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, mostly herded by children or adolescents, similar to sheep herding.
The horse-drawn carriage was built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the carriage roads consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horse to pull at a faster speed and carry a greater load than on the everyday rough roads.
The rails were known fairly early on to hold the rails in place, however, gradually it was realised that these rails would work more efficiently if there were small pieces of metal at the top.
This became the norm, however the iron made the wheels of the chariots break more quickly.
"Eventually wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767 the first all-iron railway was launched".
The first known form of transportation was walking, which humans began to do two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, did not have a straight gait.
Traits of bipedal species are found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists to reduce the burden for the future to some degree.
This is the same as treating the symptoms of many diseases, but if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and how to counteract it.
Clearly, the world has changed so much because of man's scientific and technological achievements, and the problems have been made worse by the overpopulation and the unrestrained lifestyle of humans.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
In about 150 to 200 copies were created overnight, today known as the Dunlap print.
The first reading of this document was by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy was sent to London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets are believed to be the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy is no longer extant.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still exists today.
Many people don't think of these animals as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But the birds still have a lot in common with the dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, and they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-rexes.
Almost all of the computers we use today are based on the transformation of information encoded in binary form.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary sequences - or bit, used in computing language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are often not sufficient to provide an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of organ toxicity is probably the presence of an open container of a toxic drug or household chemical.
Check the label for specific precautions for specific toxins.
Insectologists use the term "bubble" in the formal sense to designate this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient familiarity with the Bed Bug, an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both leeches and bed bugs are late-nesting species, adapting to live in nests or living on hosts.
Across the United States, there are now about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurodegenerative disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that having a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples have decided to plan for adoption.
In an adoption agreement, the adoptive parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt their child.
The primary goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which has actually led to most scientific research.
However, it is not just experimentation, and an experiment is an experiment that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to question them, and to make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Accept Aristotle's view of all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in psychology and behavior are largely dependent on the presence of the endogenous cycle and the reproduction of these rhythms through the biological clock.
Cycles, not simply responses to external signals, have been observed for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator and will continue to freely cycle time even in the absence of external influence.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most convincing pieces of evidence that DNA is a kind of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phytozoa, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to mark the DNA sequence inside the phagocyte with a radioactive phosphorus compound or the phagocyte protein with radioactive sulfur.
Gene mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected gene segment, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell.
Only mutations in the bacterial lineage can be passed on to the offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts visitors who enjoy visiting natural areas to be able to mingle with the landscape of the park and the plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and researching information about ecosystems.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about the Bornean rose.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to work and pass others who are coming to the same place they left to work.
In a powertrain transportation system, everyone is connected to and supports a transportation system by their own car.
Science now says that this giant carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has allowed humanity to evolve over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaint about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause complaints, why do they make frequent mistakes? Are transportation engineers not qualified enough? Or is there a more fundamental reason going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points as well as how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to study traffic because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within the appropriate range; therefore, traffic flows tend to be logically consistent and can be generalized mathematically.
To better simulate traffic flows, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help plan, design, and operate the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid predators and more efficient for finding food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This allows them to hide in small places to escape predators.
Today, the only species of cranes that can't fold their wings are the grayling and the puffins.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some think he was right but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river in the world, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at times as wide as six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of this planet into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long. It draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids could never surpass their size and their perfect construction techniques.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the works of their ancestors that still stand thousands of years later.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in law and official communication.
Italian is used as an everyday language by those working in the state while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because all of them can be detected in nature in their elemental form and are relatively easy to extract with atomic tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that all things are created by a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, wind, and fire.
This is like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he hypothesized that they transform into new matter to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms so small that they're trillions of atoms can be as small as the dot at the end of this sentence.
So from the very first day, the pencil has been a good friend to many.
Sadly, as new writing methods came into existence, the pencil lost its place and became less and less used.
Today, people who type messages on computer screens never have to touch a pencil.
One can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works by using energy to combine the nucleus of an atom with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, split it again, and then release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break up with little or no effect.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers [30 miles] thick on the left side and about 100 kilometers [60 miles] on the moon's obscured surface.
It is thinner below the maria (sea) and thicker at the high altitude.
There may be more impact basins on the adjacent sides because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people pay attention or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are externally acquired as they mature.
These theories look at what motivates some people to do the things they want to do and what environmental factors cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theoretical contents are Maslow's Tower Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, there are two types of behavior that can occur when a manager starts leading his former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, applying forms of discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and keeping people working responsibly.
Some people will turn into a completely different person and feel they have to change everything that the team is doing and doing themselves.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This action sometimes leads to a rift between the leader and others in the team.
Remote teams must meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are still minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for real team members to be close to them.
They often have more autonomy than the average member because their team can meet on different time frames, which may not be sympathetic to their local board of directors.
The presence of the real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a special component of the virtual team.
The invisible team is the management group to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of setting up an educational organization? One goal to put organized learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be unleashed.
So the process of organizations working together to overcome a certain obstacle can lead to a new process of innovation to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be creative, leadership needs to create a culture of creativity as well as the sharing of knowledge and curiosity of the whole collective.
Angel (2006) defines Continuity as a methodology to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical methods for investigating cognition, so it narrows the scope of the study and makes it much more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior provides support for scientists in their research.
We've known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, disease and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain neurological functions.
The development of new technology allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of the brain.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has a great significance in science fiction, AI also shapes an extremely important branch of computer science, processing behaviors, being able to learn and sensing and simulating intelligence in machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become their own rules, focused on providing solutions to practical problems in life.
AI systems are commonly used today in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as in many home computer and video game software applications.
The practical journey is an important part of the classroom. Teachers quite often take students to places where taking the bus is not an option.
Technology provides solutions in the form of virtual reality trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in class.
Sharing your picnic online is also a great way to revisit the trip and share the experience with future students.
For example, each year the students at Bennet in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year the website is re-modeled, however the old versions are kept online as a keepsake.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. When students start blogging, they often make sloppy grammatical and spelling mistakes, and the presence of readers generally changes that.
Students were often the most difficult critics, so the blogger began to try to improve the quality of the articles to avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging encourages students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them. The need to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to become intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that stimulate collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional classroom setting.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more sensitive to analytical and reasoning skills; through positive responses to material on the Internet, students can identify their role in the context of other people's writing as well as present their views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, possessing a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canadian historical and modern artifacts.
Further south is Niagara Falls and north is Muskoka with its wild natural beauty and more.
All of these things and so much more make Ontario what outsiders see as the essence of Canada.
The larger areas farther north are sparsely populated and some are almost deserted.
A demographic comparison may surprise many: African Americans in the United States outnumber Canadians.
East Africa Islands in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and most extensive continent dedicated to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama found the Cape Route, which ran from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Female visitors should say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing rings will also work (only the ones that don't look too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to a situation where they consider harassment and following, holding hands, etc. to be normal.
Be firm in your refusal, and do not be afraid to take a stand (whether it is culturally different or not, that does not make right wrong!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and only abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Kingdom of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan vending places such as Tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, Shisha and all kinds of trinkets but only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was flattened by the Nyiragongo volcano, which burned much of the city, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is still within the safe limits allowed, any visit from outside the city still needs to be thoroughly studied to learn about the fighting that currently exists in North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking equipment in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (carriages) to visit Goma. The (local) price is usually ~500 Congolese Franc for that short trip.
Due to its relatively inaccessible nature, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for strange, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the encroachment of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World television special on PBS.
It is a complete contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each one home to a wildlife system.
It is one of South Africa's main tourist attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks Authority (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, conservation activities take place daily and tickets must be purchased at the park entrance.
It's also advantageous for someone to buy a Wild Card, as it can allow you to enter either the parks in South Africa or all the National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where many visitors see the main attraction.
The parade of buildings makes the Hong Kong skyline resemble a glittering shape charted by the presence of water in Victoria Bay.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go directly to the Kowloon River.
The bulk of Hong Kong's urban areas are developed concentrated in the open areas along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists took their own lives and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past this is a very good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal saline forest in the world stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The forest area on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Beyond the mangrove swamps, these forests include some of the remnants of the once-magnificent forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is water/marshland.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 stag deer in the area.
Buses departing from the inter-district bus station (along the river) run all day, although mostly, especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang will depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-city buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by the Japanese minibus Coaster, which is very comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a convenient and quick form of transportation to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two 3.5 meters wide lanes.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not until March 2017 that the bridge was inaugurated.
The bridge is expected to be officially operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs station is completed, as planned.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous people in the region that is now eastern Paraguay, with a semi-nomadic hunting and subsistence agriculture lifestyle.
The Chaco region has other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who make their living by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant of the Indies", came into existence after the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish ushered in a colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has tried to maintain its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas domed court.
Smaller tournaments and matches may also take place here at other times of the year.
For information on the tournament and where tickets are sold, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which has a fixed value in terms of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located on Stanley Street opposite FIC West.
Generally, the British pound will be accepted anywhere in the islands and, within the Stanley range, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British or U.S. currency may be; check with the owner beforehand to see which payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland coins outside these islands, so change before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer here is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; during the summer months, temperatures are usually above +30°C.
Winter can be cold in a deceptive way: temperatures are rarely below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the temperature feel colder than it appears on a thermometer.
There is no distinct "rainy season" or "dry season": the amount of rainfall throughout the year is almost constant.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild animals and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all wild animals!
No matter how benign they may appear, wild boars, gray deer, moose, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack you.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big and wild and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware of the odors that may attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and maintain hygiene around the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was found in the 1850s and officially became the capital of Samoa from 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval truce in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the period of independence conflict organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the murder of Tupua leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is situated between two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in North Harbour District) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches that are safe for swimming and most have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on Waitemata Harbour in the upper suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with many shops along the coast, where it's safe to swim.
The local beer is mainly Number One, which is not a blended beer, but is enjoyable and refreshing.
There are many French wines you need to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be less affected by being moved.
Local tap water is absolutely safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you're worried about this.
For Australians the idea of flat white coffee is foreign. Short black coffee is espresso, cappuccino coffee over cream (no foam) and tea served without milk.
Hot chocolate by Belgian standards, expensive but delicious fruit juice.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from the reef are rare.
However, follow the government's advice, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of the 1770s. Occasionally they can be seen outside of this time.
Sharks do occur but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not usually found in the sea, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance assures travelers that they will have a place to stay when they arrive.
Travel agencies are often associated with certain hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation such as camping through a travel agency.
Travel companies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport pickups, or even a combination of airfare and hotel.
They can also reserve a place for you if you need time to consider a job offer or to process other documents related to your destination (e.g. visas).
However, any requests or adjustments are not sent directly to the hotel but must be handled first through the travel agent.
With some festivals, the majority of attendees decide to camp on site, and most attendees see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite close to the sound.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage has been turned off, some areas of the festival will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the berth, as the icebreaker makes a terrible noise that not everyone can bear.
The travel time of the Saint Petersburg train includes the time in the city.
Casinos often try to make the visitor spend the most time and money, and in these places there are often no windows or clocks, and the exit is difficult to find.
They often offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep customers comfortable, and to keep them staying.
Some establishments serve alcohol on the premises, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers understand the importance of keeping their minds sharp.
Anyone who wants to drive on high ground or on a sidewalk needs to weigh the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The friction on the icy roadbed and the low snow cover make it impossible to drive as you would on a normal asphalt road.
If there is a snowstorm, snowfall in a short period of time is enough to get you stuck.
Vision may also be limited by snowfall or snow blowing or condensed steam or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many waters, and year-round traffic is almost uninterrupted.
The safari is perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a journey on foot to admire the wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are usually well within sight of vehicles and can be easily observed with our normal tools.
Lions, hunting leopards, and leopards can be very guarded at times, so to get a better view, you might want to use binoculars.
A safari (also called a bushwalk, bush adventure, or bushwalk) is a hike, for a few hours or days, that involves climbing a mountain.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events being held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you book your 2020 flight and accommodation before the delay notice, you could be in a bind.
However, as of the end of March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not allow for an extension until July 2020 - the time the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a table and a stool for lending, even if you don't see one in the room.
If you don't have a table or if you don't like to go to the bar, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the cloth overheat (which can cause shrinkage, or in severe cases, can cause burns).
There are many ways to filter water, some of which are very effective in removing specific hazards.
In some places, a minute's boiling is sufficient, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Visitors may encounter predators that they have never seen in their homeland.
Harmful species can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case can cause allergies, spread toxins, or spread infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, are not normally considered to be pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from value-added tax and excise duty in some locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated, forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, prepare your mind for steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limits prescribed in this area are considerably lower than those of the road sections before and after - the common speed falls within the range of 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these regulations is extremely important.
What's odd, of course, is that cell phone service is much stronger here than it is along many of the other stretches of this route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty and in Bavaria, the pastries are quite dense and varied, similar to its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit cakes are very popular here of which apples are used for making cakes all year round, while cherries and plums are also used in the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, berries, and other nuts, and they are best served with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want something small from a cake, try something the locals call a Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of broth in it.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an extremely rich blend of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, when used without the addition of a qualifier, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the large island of Java.
Already widespread throughout the islands, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simple spiced dishes, the Javanese's favorite flavours being beans, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
A saddle is a device that helps a rider get up from the saddle and down on two legs.
They provide greater stability for the driver but may have safety concerns due to the potential for leg jamming for the driver.
If the rider falls but is stuck in the saddle, they may be pulled if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, a few precautions can be taken.
First, most riders carry high-heeled boots with smooth, rather narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if the rider is dragged backwards.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite with its many vertical cliffs and jagged slopes of granite.
From the top of the mountain, you can see the breathtaking landscape, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes between the many potential cliffs.
Downhill skiing sports including skiing and snowboarding are popular sports involving sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snow boards attached to your legs.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as ski bums, planning an entire vacation revolving around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Cross-country skiing has been a sport since at least the 17th century and in 1861, the first recreational skiing club was founded by Norwegians living in Australia.
Mountain skiing: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, tourist skiing or walking skiing.

Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no specific definition for an artifact to determine whether it is an antique.

A whirlwind is a current of water that flows backwards from the surf to the shore, usually on a reef or similar location.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow is concentrated in some deeper areas and fast currents to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim upstream, which seems impossible.
As soon as you get out of the swirling current, swimming back in is no more difficult than it used to be.
Try to swim in a direction where you will not be swept away by the current, or choose to stay in a place where you can wait for rescue, depending on your skill and whether or not anyone detects your dangerous condition.

The only way to get your cargo faster is to send it in a baggage claim, because airline regulations don't allow baggage without passengers, and that's where you need to go.
One way is to fly first class or business class, which means spending a lot of money to get this privilege (or, better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, the cost is not cheap: as a general rule, you may have to pay four times the price of a general class ticket for a business class ticket, and eleven times for a first class ticket!
In general, it would be useless to hunt for a discount for business or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines don't know that there's a certain core group of passengers who are willing to spend the most for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and comfortable, and they charge accordingly.
