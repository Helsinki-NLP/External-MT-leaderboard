White f-foot, black e-foot, white g-foot, black woman h4-foot - crazy chess! This is jokingly referred to in chess circles as "foolish madness".
White: Tower in a1, pawn in b6, king in c8. Black: pawn in a7 and b7, king in a8, pawn in b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower in a6, after which Black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move his pawn in any other chess on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White advances his pawn from b6 to b7 and gives a mad chess.
