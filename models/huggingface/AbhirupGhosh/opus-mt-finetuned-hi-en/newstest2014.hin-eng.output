Black box in your car?
While U.S. road operators are struggling to reduce funds to improve Highway systems, there are many people looking for solutions from small black box which fit your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile run by motor vehicles and transmits the information to officials, today it has become an issue for Washington and State Planning Office.
Generally, boring work like Highway planning has also become an issue of serious debate and biodiversity.
You've done research about miles driven by miles and possibly places driven-and then use this information to prepare a tax bill - for allowing the government to provide support for the use of these black box.
Tea party is curious.
American Civil Independence Union is also concerned with raising different types of confidential issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action, not many states are waiting.
They're discovering how in the next decade they can go into a system in which the driver can pay every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for test drive, some of which are G.P.S. monitoring.
It's really essential for our country.
This is not the subject of our choice or not to be selected by us. It says that Husn Akbara, who is the executive director of the South Madras Government, who is planning to track every mile set by motorists in Calcutta by 2025.
We're going to change the way we pay taxes.
It's technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country 's high-scale trust has become almost derived, whose finance costs are paid by American citizens on gas pumps.
American people don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The car runs more than ever in a gallons gas.
There was no increase in the federal tax last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallons.
Due to high value of gas, politicians also avoid increasing money in tax.
There is absolutely nothing worth doing about it says Limikh, director of transport policy at Toronto University.
His state has launched a tracking device in 500 cars recently to test per-Mal payments system.
He says,It's going to work as the most convincing option during the post-war period.
Vax it is called Myz-based user fee.
It's not surprising that this idea is good for urban liberalists because, for example, it can change ways of driving cars, which can help reduce drinking and reduce greenhouse gases.
Chalukya's plans are eager for this system, whereas they are developing strategy to achieve the goal of the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Suster(A.P.A.) also consider Black Box as the most long-term option.
The independent sellers are also in favour of payment per mile from the driver.
John Moore, vice president of policy in Rihan, said,It's not just what is going on in the blind well.
People are paying more directly for what they're getting.
This campaign has been supported by two former US transport secretaries who had favored their report in the year 2011 to move forward with the Congress in the direction of per-mill payments.
U.S. Senator accepted a test project of 90-million dollar last year, which included 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural law, which were representative of people who had to walk too much miles to go to work or go to city, the leadership of the House ended that motion.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most willing Orionon, which listed 5,000 drivers in the biggest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay their fees instead of gasing the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving towards this direction.
Illino is trying with trucks on this limited basis.
And I-95 matches, including 17 states transport department(including Maryland, Penisnia, Virginia and Florida) are studying how to do this change.
This idea did not get support in all places.
In Nevada, where this device was put on 50 voluntary cars earlier, the drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor every step they took.
According to Alaudin Khan, who directed the strategy and action management department in Nevada Transport department, there was a major problem of concern about Bharat Bhai and other types of things.
It's not something that people wanted.
At the same time, Nevada's A.C.L.U had warned on his website: It would be easier to convert these device into full tracking device than it was.
There is no need to develop large, unconstitutional technology structure, which each individual must be able to keep track of his journey.
Nevada is one of the many states which she's doing all possible efforts to achieve appropriate technology, with which the state can get details of how many miles the car is going, but not where and when it's going.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some states to Chalukyan Start-up, which is called Tulphiya.
This firm was mainly not in the business to help members of the state.
This was attempting to enter an auto insurance market, where drivers had to pay on the basis of their salary.
But the device that this is testing liked by Highway Schemeors because it doesn't use GPS and provides very limited information which is uploaded by modems at fixed intervals.
If you don't track people's pace and their place, they'll be more willing to adopt this method if you don't track them.
There have been some serious mistakes in these early programmes of state.
There are very low expenses and less intervention methods to do this.
In Orregon, planning operators are using different options to give different options.
They can choose GDP device without GSP.
or any device can choose not to take it again, but can choose to pay any fee on the basis of the average mile fixed by the citizens of state.
Other places are expected to provide better facilities in the device than in device. This can be sold to concerned citizens.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop taxing devices which allow▁जल fees to be paid, According to their drive, insurance will provide insurance, and the speed of time from other drivers will create data collection which can be used to avoid motor traffic.
The city planning document tells us, Momer-mantra will be attracted to participation because of the benefits it received
However, some transport schemes are surprised that there is a lot of discussion on payments according to miles.
In San Francisco Gulf, Mumbai Transport Commission has said that by increasing the Congress gas tax, Diwali Hind Hind's problem can easily deal with the problem.
There can also be added compensation of one-time or any other cars, whose vehicles don't use too much gas so that they can pay their proper part.
Redy Raytler, director of the Commission 's Legislative and Public Affairs, said, What is needed for surgery when you can work with a disorder.
If we do this then millions of cars will be worried about our privacy and many other things.

Frotier Air Indies - Payoffs on Bankes
Fentier Airlines has plans to charge $100 per cent for passengers on their aircraft board.
Frotier Airlines has plans to start charge for $100 for the bag and this, for coffee or for Soda, is going to pay $12, although on Wednesday he announced that the passengers could keep the entire box.
The new clinic - On-the duty overload is for the bag, so, under the seat, the smaller bag will be charged again.
Fentier said that he would charge $25 if he was paid in Edins , he would have to wait $100 if the passengers were waiting for him to pay while he was at the gate.
Frotier spokesman Ket O 'Maley said that there was to be a charge to take care of per 100 per cent of the passengers.
We don't want to charge that, he said.
Airplanes started charge for the first and second test bag in 2008.
The passengers who are trying to avoid fees are filling up as much as they can, which is covered in the chest-on bags ; it means that there is often less space in this box.
There's a way to get the passengers down on the tenancy board.
O'Meli said that it wasn't really about putting up a new charge.
It's for the most loyal customers about Frotier that finding overheed Bin has become very difficult.
You don't have to give this to passengers who buy tickets in their website of Airline.
This means that in line the next person may be able to pay 100 dollars for a common bag, whereas on a frontier gate a passenger can get a bag free.
O'Meli said that Frotier's website and check processes are being changed. You know about fees before you get the gate.
Frotier's new fund-on fee will not start till summer, though there is no date specified.
Travelers often express discontent about bags and other fees, but aircraft services like them.
He argues that money is spent to handle the bags, and those who want passenger services should pay for it.
On Wall Street the fees are seen as a sign that many Airline lost years after the year they are laying enough money to cover the cost of air travel.
though most of them - they're not accessable.
Spirt Aarlines Inc. He started his salary three years ago, and he worked three years later.
Along with such a fee there is another Airline Hugary Airlines Airlines Airlines Airline Airlines Airline Director J. Soensen said, and which tracks As- on fees.
He said that farmers - on account of the fees brought about by $50 million in one year which was estimated in the report of December 2011.
One former official from Sonensen, Broadest Airlines recently flew into Spirt and passengers had to face air conditioning on the gate but not unusual bags.
Toboarding process that I saw in my Airline carrier was easy he said.
I was expected to bite my teeth and look out at a fight gate.
was full of philosophy and he said it was litigry-up
Fentier is also following Rs 2 fees for coffee, tea, sodas, or jus.
Frontier said that passengers who take Sonda, or jus can keep the entire box, and they will give free coffee only for once.
It'll still give away the water.
US in short air supply tried to charge for drinking products in 2008, but after the noise of passengers, he turned back after seven months and after getting up there, he followed.
Frontier's passengers if they don't buy directly from Airline, this step of customer 's website has its latest attempt to conduct customers to their own website.
Airplanes pay back to online▁समर्थन seller, Orbitz, like this for every dollar sold for $10 to 25 per cent.
That's why all Airlines have been encouraged to conduct passengers to buy them directly instead of running through an online▁समर्थन agency.
Although Frontier has gone forward in this area.
In September many of these customers who bought from an online Trolling agency were often able to fly away from half a mile away.
On Wednesday, it reduces my salary till 25 per cent of the cycle mile.
So, a 1000 miles bought from an online▁अत्याचारval agency will earn Rs 250 miles.
It also allows him to choose his seat in advance when he buys directly from the Frotier website.
There's a loyal base of customers in its home city in Frotier's bedroom, but its trade is declining and it's losing money.
The fall of 9 per cent in revenue and its flight capacity has been reduced to about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the Compentent Army Holding Forces, Inc.
Republic are trying to fix funds for Frotier as part of the sale of Airline.
NSA charged the site to crash instead of setting up websites on the private error

At least one Executive group has claimed that they are responsible for launching NSA website by DDS attack.
D.D.S.S. attacks are designed in such a way that the target website is sent to traffic till the server overload is closed.
This technical strategy is relatively insignificant and target aim is not to distinguish internal network of systems.

Germany has become the first country of European Union which has given recognition to third sex for children born with vague sex.
Now the newborn children will not be called as male or female in traditional manner.

Sex identity is not considered right yet, but most experts in United States believe that when sex is not sexual then it is better to use the best information to specify sex and try surgery, if this happens before it happens, to monitor the psychological and physical development of the child.

He said about bringing up on the website, It's very stressful, especially if you don't know what your child's sex is.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both sexes were called Harmiropholingas(O▁जलlinga),which was named after the beautiful Greek deity which was bilingi.
And more than a decade ago, the medical world considered sex as a slate which could be deleted and written.
But now many people challenge medical morality, they understand that sex is a complex thing, and sometimes it may be wrong with doctors who don't know how children will feel when they grow up.
In the middle of the 20th century, says Drresharit was called as Manic Emergency.
When these kids were born, you didn't call doctors, you called surgeons.
The present theory about the treatment of babies with vague tissues was presented by Dr. John Saux of University who considered sex to be good.
He wrote the wordlinga and argued how social and environmental gestures- parents bring up children - they interpret the child's genes and hommons to identify him as a male or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as John/Jan, his principles became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child who had been raped during his sex sex sex sex sex sex-formation ; he advised them to get rid of him and take him into his arms as a girl.
Dreys said,Man introduced the matter as a successful case, but it didn't happen.
At the age of 15, the child changed himself as a male and married a woman.
But at the age of 38. He committed suicide.
Drreshar said that some doctors are still following the image.
But after 1990, with the advent of Internet, these sex surgeons who were passing through surgery started to come out and say,Do n't be happy with the outcome.
This was the case with the 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with X.T. male chromosome, but his chromosome was vague.
The physicians didn't clearly understand that his penis was small, or he was big, but they were sure that he could never live as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and his surgery were removed and he was brought up like a girl.
At 12 years of age she was given the woman Hoirmon.
She told ABS.com,I knew I wasn't a girl.
I wasn't happy, but it was difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, Vajano was going to be pumped along with him.
But being depressed and feeling something wrong, she demanded medical records.

At birth I was tied up - and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D. who prevented his body from making a substantial amount of testoxinton due to which his tissues could not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a male, he took testosopteron's food and dropped his breast.
Due to surgery, she became barren.
Today, he explains in the organisation called Internetfes Project to make people think about sex.
However, the law-based group of California-based Advocates for Infected Chawlas, Eni Tamar-Mathi worrys that the law of Germany calls for contempt and contempt.
She says, Many activeists think that the law of Germany will move parents to make rapid decisions and specify the child as a legitimate.
We're afraid that it will encourage intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, it's better to specify male or female sex.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Metis said that his organisation endorses Australian law because it allows adults to identify in third sex.
He said,The adults should be able to make their own decision about the system sex.
The law of Germany is related to specifying it at birth.
This isn't a fight for new kids at this time.
When grown up, they can make decisions relating to their bodies.
But Germany's law would give both parents and children power, Dr.▁सम्मानinjaz, whose daughter is sexual development disorder and support helps hundreds of others in the group.
The daughter of Birjri was born with male chromosomes, but she was a D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.
because his▁मौजूद-in-law was guilty, so women were developed in Catri.
Her body consists of vagina, but she is not pregnant or eggs.
Now, 29-year-old Cati is married, and in Penicin University there is a child psychology council.
although she is barren, but she hopes to become mother through her adoption or the National Sirgasi.
Bajz said,This law allows parents and fathers not to make any decision in a hurry.
It allows them to understand and spend time before they write,Man or Woman before they write.
So, you live well - raise your baby, love your baby.
You have a lovely kid and enjoy it.
We don't have to get surgery immediately which cannot be returned.
He said, It brings up children in the process of decision and frees parents from anxiety because they don't believe they're doing well
After all, the child will decide with which sex he is much easier with - and this will be very good.
This enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Report: Consider the Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, President Barak Obama's closest advisors secretly considered the post for Vice-General at Hillary Tribunal instead of the▁पूरे of Biden for 2012.
The most remarkable sound in the▁वर्तमान is that of Mark Halparini and John Mandran, who was expected for a significant period of 2012 campaign : Relief Down: Change the game 2012.
Times received a copy of the next book and told that the President's top advisors were organized on Thursday evening to see what can be done again in Obama's view of election.
According to the Times National Political reporter Jonathan Martin, the book tells us all details about his efforts in the campaign for main rights and his major bill for White House staff, for the name of White House, to find out what effect the Vice President of the State has on the change from the President.
The possible switch was a very safe secret within the basic structure of Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office.
with only half a dozen president's personal advisors, former Obama campaign chief Jim Macina, and former White House senior advisors were known to be subject to change.
Dalbal Down claims to have tried to change Biden despite his personal balance, when he was telling his information before making decisions, Obama would not be able to improve the condition of Obama.
In an interview with Martin, he has confirmed that administration was actually considered in place of Drinton with Biden.
Man kept track of the whole view and one of them said,It was this he said to the paper((((
You remember, President was in danger at that time, so we were in such situation as,What else shall we do, Christ?
While Poo has told the research as careful, Martin told Anderson Kuper of CCN again how much of this claim this will be worth if this is done on getting an important investment.
The campaign is not spending on votes and attention groups like Pashso until they are seriously considering something, Martin said on May360.
It's vague, Ashkey, Obama's team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked if his boss knew about possible amendments?
whereas Poo said that he didn't think the President knew about possible changes. The former chief of staff admitted that it was possible to know Obama.
Dalbal Down: doesn't reply about political investigation and coming to Obama's desk? Martin told more.
Kuper asked Martin if he thought seriously about Obama Biden dumping Research.
Probably Martin said.

Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we've been warned that there will be a need for free Scotland to join in Europe as independent travel zone.
On Barwick, the passport controls, and on the walls of Haridan indicate the boundary of the cervitor.
The truth is that the wicketcraft paper described the possible economic advantages of being independent with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - it didn't describe it in Headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that most members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Sangon area, so Brashire actually wants to get whatever he wants from Scotland, there will be continuous non-official exemption for brinton.
So, again, A-Khani.
And the thing which has been trapped since this long time has grown. First, I mean 'Purta', the passport control was heard nearly 40 years ago.
However, the interesting point was lost in telling this interesting story again.
Why should we expect free Scotland to pass Europe anyway?
Why should London's yok be traded for Bra▁सवालों, especially now?
Here's real European news: The great, war scheme of organising Europe has finally stopped.
With the▁तलवारro crisis, the project has been officially dead.
In the entire EU, dedicated teams are getting strong enough to oppose EU or to close cell phone as similar currency.
Even in Germany, Trooperative Fort - which has been established in this year - suddenly came and scored nearly five million votes in the Union elections of September, thus effectively outside our Free Democracy.
The planning to build federal Europe has always been a domestic protest.
But, the present economic crisis proved to be radical.
Along with hard rules imposed by Berlin and Europe Central Bank, many people have to think that the project has gone far.
The maximum budget of national governments wasn't very much played in the loss of▁वसीयतro's crisis - this was only true in Greece's case.
In fact, the system has supported its members in favour of German exporters - something that German politician wants to maintain.
Without possibility of domestic currency, South Europe finds itself in a position of harmful productivity compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce pay and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
On budget and currency ahead of problems, deep European producers have gone on.
To enable French and German power firms on consumers to get rid - because of power policies imposed by Bragraphy, European industry pays four times for electricity compared to the United Nations.
That's the cost that we've seen already in Lebanon.
In the world, it can also save the European Deputy industry from being affected by cheap U.S. Shell gas.
As a result people's feeling of rebellion is increasing, especially in France, who was once the main admirer of EU.
After Yudhistra, France's top politicians saw Germany control, and Paris as a way of providing billing equal to Vahitton in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, which causes France's economy to deteriorate.
The result is Mahan Lee Pen's south side, E.U.P. National Front has been defeated by pushing the ruling socialist towards third place.
At this time, Front 24 per cent is the most popular party in France with votes - this is a warning for British Leber that they can't believe that for the left, there will be no profit for the right.
What's Lee Pen French Gores doing with his new fame in the middle of the working class?
This party wants to use e.U.C. elections which are coming next year.
If, as it is possible, in these elections the anti-▁वास्तव groups of parties perform good performance, this type of group can first affect European Parliament.
My outlook is this: Soon, in Europe, antipathy and communalism will end the marble of anti-Tranchand.
Euro doesn't end, but it doesn't end, it'll go back to Europe like Europe of nations, which will be supported by General Dilip.
Germany and some of its organised economy can maintain the Union, but France and South Europe will resume their currency.
I'm expected to keep myself away from this project in hope to raise data with U.S.
However, the growing interest of Vaishnton in the background indicates that Britain will be released in cold Atlantic.
What happens to Scotland after all?
We can choose to be a part of Little England.
or we can protect economic interests ourselves - which includes telling Berlin and Brabir at the right time to separate.
I think Scotland can do better work in the Constituent European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It would be easier to interact with other countries in Europe along with other common thinking countries.
Otherwise we should consider keeping our economic freedom on the way of Norve.
In Scotland, S.N.P. Government - generally referred to in Europe-it has been the most successful political campaign, which proposed by Leber's Cler▁समर्थितetcher Dantling(Terrorist), and after that was won in 2011 on the basis of the US-Hindi Day league.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time because in that case he has to accept the rules of mediation which are imposed by Berlin and Bra▁कड़ी.
before time: Getting older
Research shows that African-American and Hykanic girls get methane at younger ages than their age girls.
Physical change doesn't mean that it's near.
There is no evidence that Hoermon or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity can be a cause of obesity at a lesser age.
Before time, Yuvin's case is not as dominant among boys
According to C.N, former reporter Pat Patte, Children's health and family issues are expert journalists.
Should the mother be worried if at the age of 7 or 8 at the age of pregnant mothers begin to develop and grow?
This week in Orlando, Florida, at the annual meeting of American Children Medical Academy in America, Dr. Paul Caplovez explained that these initial changes are common among American girls, this is a new practice.
Caploz says,I spend a lot of time to convince parents that it doesn't usually reflect rapid progress in the direction of the whole world.
The obvious symptoms of growth like the rise of breasts, reproduction, sex and body smell are seen from time to time.
But during the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of Rjojsha(first month-class).
In United States, average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
When breast growth starts then it takes at least two to three years in Razhan , says Caploz , who says from time to time to time  to deal with this common problem  are also authors of the guidebooks which are necessary to deal with the problem .
The most accurate examination of the development of Yuvin is time.
There's a debate about what's the beginning, but when breast growth starts before 8 years, two are called 'bal.
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - whose child doctors can monitor closely.
In case of more rapid progress there can be an investigation by NODNNNA so that there are serious problems like tumors or diabetics can be solved.
Treatment for pre-time monthly and other consequences is to improve the age-old age of bone, which is due to increase in growth and growth as adults.
Helping drug or hoarmon treatment depends on child age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
psychological aspects are also important.
There is an english information about drugs, but admits, It can increase the behavioural issue, and girls may begin to feel separated from their peers.
The second big problem can be considered: the parent doesn't just want his daughter to have breast cancer.
She said, They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they will keep clean.
One woman whose daughter was born at 10 years of age recalls,It was a shock.
Although there were symptoms of this thing and we talked about monthly, but it wasn't emotionally ready.
She was scared of her school and worried that she was the first month in her friends.
There are many well-known principles about the reasons for current life.
However, there is no constant evidence that, in milk or other foods, Hoermon, chemicals in environment or media can be accused of sexual messages.
Sons - like girls - from time to time they are getting old.
Caplovij defines the rule that its main reason is the anger of communalism.
He helped in conducting studies on girls 6 to 9 years of age in 2001, which connects body fat to the time of sexual intercourse.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hiusnic girls have the tendency to get the female before their age girls.
There's a lot of explanation about this.
On the global scale, time-to-day representations from economic conditions to climate and genes are influenced by all things.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial hair at young age, but they are not clear as girls.
Other doctors attending the ADP conference supported the complexity of the subject.
Even in babies and children it has become common to see the hair of glucose.
Lok Sabhai Patel, a child doctor at Harvardtown Hospital at Harvard Hospital, says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, says, We need to be careful about how we identify the actual beginnings of America.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their child doctor for advice on how to talk to their children.
Caploz advised,It can mean talking before expected time.
If you stay calm your child will usually respond properly.
Girls who develop from time to time need to be convinced that even if this is happening from time to time, it is part of normal life.

With controversy for seat width, there were major orders on the batsman's head.
For this month there has been a competition for fighting against the Dubai Acto for long distance flights between tourists and engineers for the width of their seats for tourist flights.
The controversy is focused on the width of the Ekammoni class in long flights, not always as given by Arlines, but that which has been assigned to the best of the location, Abusa and Bowong company has claimed to be the key.
At least 18 inch(6 cm) in this week's Eccombies has been expected, but it has to be decided by Arlines by its main source-dependor Boing.
The controversy comes between the vimana producers when after the incident of 17-21, the order which has been recorded after the last distance started to sell a lot of twin engine.
How has the last department of the vimana been created - especially if C▁रहीing 9 or 10 is equal to the claims of more capacity are produced by mini Jambo jets?
It is said that this777 X which will give 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in one row in a famous department.
Air Bus says he would take 350 people out of 18 inches in the seat, playing with A350.
The vimana often hit technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, with Air Bus 777 X, there is hope to control more than 100 orders in Dubai Act, which appeals to the public.
It's been seen recently that there's been anything starting to happen. This is shown by Jainsero at the same time, three at the same time. Are you going to admit it together?
Aeroplane sales chief John Lehi also said that there was a long distance flying in hybrids from regional tambao((
As a change, people are getting great, but they don't change the way they sit.
According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s, when Bollywood was defined as 747 Jambu, n'anskrit 40-49-49-year-old American males increased 10 per cent.
According to American health statistics, the average American man's waist is 39.7 inch in the 21st century.
Airbu says that its rival is connected with a seat concept of 1950 when the new name set was an average perimeter of diameters.
Air Bus says they have established research programmes which will suggest improvement in quality of Rs 53 per cent of sleep in the width of the seat.
Bojing disputed data on air bus seat measurements and said that it doesn't depend on the decision of manufacturers how Airplanes rent and make balance between facilities.
It also says that research shows that more than one seat's experience depends on.
▁ध्यान It's actually helpful to provide airlines and what they believe is what they need to do to succeed.
They don't want us to tell you what they benefit from
They know better about their business than anyone else.
For fluoros it's about▁मौजूदindian room, but for solvents it's a very fast issue that it can affect income.
There are at least 700 billion dollars of trade behind this dispute. Air Force competition for American and European exports is adequate in decades.
Roykar reported his report in July, for the first time, what seat model is really the issue between new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boning has been claimed to have taken up 20 per cent of its new twin design than its leader, 365-Cotting 777-300.
The claim of the performance depends on comparison of 777 x forest with 777 design.
Due to profit in unit costs 10 equal comparison is now used.
Kewin Keinton, U.S. Airplane facility, says,It's going to capture more seats with our products, and more than that.
On the other hand, the investigators say that there's 10-to-one line of line present for 777 that there are many passengers on the side of the taxpayer office, who can go with cheap rent at the same time.
The seat width of 18 inch will be very good for passengers, said Kebni specialists at my Karb, founder and editor. But the fact is that this business point of aircraft is conducted by the threat of 777.
Airplanes and Boating seats do not provide but a list is providing for electors.
All over the world jet sellers also make careful use of this data competition.
In getting more comfortable, all builders are providing higher density positions for jet aircraft cost services and regional travel.
Airplanes it's doing 10 equal A350 but says it's not sold.
But as recently as the Air Bus needed more oxygen, some of its jet aircraft insisted on the wide part of the panel seats.
Modern jets are not likely to fly on a new industry without support from other producers but it can deviate from the wave of 777 X sales.
The new anti-uncootion vaccine can end the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-uncootion vaccine which can end the fun of smoking.
The same dose of vaccine was able to keep rats safe from solvent addiction for life.
Before a test is started on man, he needs further examination, in which he can take many years, but in New York Professor Roard, professor of Vellal Medical College, said that there are positive indications.
Professor Karnel said that we hope that this type of vaccine can eventually help millions of users who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market today but found that their addiction to smoking is far more powerful than these existing methods.
There is a harmless virus in the new vaccine, which has been prepared to provide genetic information to create an anti-in-Turinan Antimediaz.
This virus, electively infected cell, which starts to form a permanent stream of anti-Bombids after this.
Anti-Bombides find out any breathing molecules in the blood, preventing them from coming into the brain through smoking.
In test, they were given vaccines, which were later blown up, doing their normal activities.
researchers say, but the mouse which was not given vaccines seemed good. This was an indication that the pulses reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Transliteration.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they had anti-Bombidis.
It had to feed on regular intervals, so that the anthropomics could continue to exist, but it proved to be expensive and expensive.
But the cost of new vaccine is expected to be very high because it will make it anthropological factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was safe then it could be given to children before today's greed for smoking, so that they could be protected from smoking.
But it's probably used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
He said,They know that if they start smoking again, they won't get any pleasure from smoking because of smoking, which can help them get rid of their habit.
British scientists told the result interesting, but warned us of the need to do lots of research.

Jaishan Kurmer points out:Our goal for HS2 is real national network which will bring access to UK and its cities.
We're moving with HS2, because its profits will be very much.
Without this we'll face problems related to our railway network capacity.
But this is also about connectivity of 18 cities of Britain, including Glasso and Edinburgh, which will connect with HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alice McMock, according to:Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
For Scottish government, Keth Brown appealed to Mr Car▁लिया from HS2 network to return to Scotland.

US federal aircraft administration has opened the option to change its procedures for American Air▁अलावा so that passengers will be able to read e-book, watch video or play games during the important stages of flight, if they are in the equipment mode.
Travelers can do this during many flights, but it's not good to be able to fly many people and reach their e-books while flying.

Quantas said that it will follow current rules right now.
It said that we cannot use electrical equipment when we fly according to our current policy and when aircraft crash, and we don't have any immediate plan to change it.
FAQA decisions are applicable to America's Elberlines.
Well, we are always interested in organisational development which can benefit passengers and we will think of the reasons for the decision and its behind.
The effect of this decision will be different on every US Airing Service Company and will depend on their age of aircraft.
Airplanes service companies will need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio pollution from mobile equipment, as also they will need to amend their rules to give short details to their rules, training materials, health-tonies program and passengers.
Says FAA that after the success of their aircraft by aeroplanes, he will allow passengers to take control over all heights, light weight equipment such as Tenbate, e-rayer and smart phone.
In rare cases of lack of identity, the crew will direct the crew to close their equipment during landing.

FA: Airplanes(but you can't call cell phone)
Airplanes will be able to go from gate to gate, read, play, play games, watch music, use their electronic device to listen to music ; but it will not be able to talk to your cell phone on Thursday Thursday through federal organisation.
But passengers shouldn't expect these changes immediately.
In a news conference, Mr.P.A. President Michael Hussain said how fast these changes are carried out, it is different in every Airline.
Airlines will show how their aircraft meet new directions, and how they monitor rules from members of their crew for training books and equipment.
F.A. says that it has already achieved plans from some Airlines to expand the use of Portable electronic device on the plane.
deltas and jet fasts are among those which have already presented plans.
F.A. said in one statement, On the basis of planning position, we can get permission for expansion of electronic device.
▁खाते, passengers need to close their Smart phone, Tebate and other devices when the gate is shut down.
They are expected to reach 10,000 feet of the aircraft and not start until they are allowed by the captain.
Travelers are expected to respiration their devices again during the landing of the aircraft, and not start till the aircraft is completely down.
F.A. said, under new directions, Airlines, which are safe from electronic disturbances, can allow its passengers to fly by plane, during flying, during landing, and during taxiing.
Most of the new Airlines companies and other vimanas which have been modified in such way that passengers can use the higher altitude, they are expected to meet these standards.
The Chairman of the Association of National Flight Actant has welcomed these changes.
Jaising said in a statement,When policy is carried out safely - and we will work together with Airlines companies to do this - it will be a victory thing for both parties.
When it comes to this issue, we've been bored by feeling likeHeal Monitor.
The agency said, but it would still be banned to connect the Internet at less than 10,000 feet high, exchange of email, send messages, or download data.
Travelers will be asked to keep their Smartphones, Tebate and other devices in electronic mode.
So there can't be any discussion with friends, online textile game, which is the famous event, that, when anter Alvin was playing on his smart phone while he was staying at the gate in 2011, and when he refused to close the device, American Airlines removed him from the plane.
And there's still to collect heavy equipment like laptops, because they'll worry about injury to other person.
During flight cell phones will continue to be banned.
Official rights relating to phone calls are passed by federal communication commission, F.A.
When flying and landing of the aircraft, F.A. can remove restrictions on some electronic device.
Last month, Mark Rosen of National Transport Security System, which is CBS National Transport security expert, said that cell phone is still considered as risky.
Rosenkar said,Sell phone is really serious, not just because they can create disruption in the navigational device, but because they can create disturbances in cell phone tower when they are in air.
To examine this issue by F.A.N., the industry Directive Committee has expressed its opinion last month that government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
In order to reduce restrictions from their usage, F.A. is increasing pressure during recent years.
Sen. Kair McCilak, D-mo's critics have said that there is no valid security reason for restriction.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the device's usage is universal.
Some studies suggest that about one third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
FAA started to ban the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when reports were received from passengers by F.M. Radio and high technology board.
New Airlines commencing companies are more dependent on electric systems than on last generation of aircraft, but they too have been adopted by FA to oppose electronic interference.
Airlines have been proposed by passengers for many years to use Y-Fi on trail height.
The aircraft modified for Y-FI system are also more resistance to disturbances.
Huerta said that most Airlines companies should be guided by characters for more use of electronic devices under new direction.
Today's electronic device, compared to the electronic device of the previous generation, generates very few medium radio transmission.
For example, during the e-rayers, in the background, there is a very well-known transferion.
But transferaries are effective when downloading or sending data by device.
One of the passengers who took part in reducing restrictions used by passengers has also been amozon.com.
In 2011, Company officers loaded their entire coaches in Airlines and arrested them for testing problems, but nobody got any such problems.
The F.A.A. Secretary-General Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks caused by the device.
The National Airplane Association said that he believes that there's going to be confusion from device, whether it's risk, whether it's real.
Other members of Committee said that there are only reports described by pilot in support of the Amendment system, which are very old.
However, members of Committee announced that F.A. pilot was allowed to order the passengers to close the device when they dropped the aircraft in less unfinishedness.
The travel industry group has welcomed changes and told him the common knowledge of people who travel during the latest phase of technology.
U.S. Trival Association said that we are happy that F.A.A. has recognized that travelers with pleasure are not incompatible with protection and protection.

Is Europe's high class ready to work with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and it was agreed to bring business together and decide what changes we want to see with UK workers and prosperous producers EU.
For him we held the biggest and most comprehensive survey of British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought about Britain's business with EU.
UK-Gav has taken a look at 1000 entrepreneurs, who are representative of Britain's commercial size, fields and places.
The findings of this survey may be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of businesses want to export out of Europe, and that they want to concentrate on countries which are becoming modern and increase, whereas EU members are getting weaker.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not to get involved in the process of improvement of EU's mysterious organisations.
When he asked his opinion about specific policies from an authority to a product law, most of the entrepreneurs believed that these decisive qualifications should come back to West Africa.
The common discontent with the single market could easily be seen, the entrepreneurs say that the value of Bragraphy is much higher than the benefits of making the business sector of Europe - even large businesses who were normally on the side of European companies were 40 per cent of this.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of entrepreneurs found that, a large part obviously wants to go ahead with politics rather than politics.
This conclusion, which was seen at the level of main business groups, showed that entrepreneurs were moving towards a 'unreal change which would give back its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price - the issue of making treaty changes for Britain and getting a better deal changed 16 per cent of vote on behalf of BU.
Prime Minister should not have any doubt: this survey suggests that British entrepreneurs support their scheme to talk about the terms of membership of Britain in EU.
It also showed that entrepreneurs, current power, want to make a meaningful change in behalf of UK.
There's a better deal for British businesses, and it's very fast going to be, because there's going to be a step forward in the direction of▁शान्तिjoan, industrial economy and state union.
First priority must be employment and increase in Britain, as our survey points out, it means a new center focus on business and fundamental change in business.

Scientists have shed more light on this subject about the relationship between the tail position and the mood of the dog.
From the past research it turns out that the happy dogs move their tail towards the right(in view) whereas the restless dogs move their tail mainly towards the left.
But now scientists say that partners can recognise this little difference between dog tail and respond to it.
This study has been published in Journal Kartwin.
From University of Trainto, Naxonist Professor Georgia Valllarchera observed:All these men know well that the left and right parts of the brain are in different ways involved in the excitement which produces positive or negative feelings.
Here we've tried to see this in other species also.
Like humans, the right part of the mind was responsible for left hand action and opposite order, and twoफिरrs played different roles in feelings.
to learn more about how dogs react to one side of the other dogs, researchers looked at other dogs' films.
He measured the heart beats of domestic dogs and analysed their behavior.
We probably don't find much time to understand why their grief sometimes moves on the other side.
Pro. Vellartura told us:We introduced dogs with films - in a shadow picture to deal with them in realistic version or other issues in confusion, and we could look at the behaviour of the tail and introduce the tail to more left or right.
When the animals saw a cold dog shaking their tail on their tails, they were at ease.
But when he looked at the tail changing direction from left to left(at the sight of a single dog), his heart burst and he felt restless
According to Proval. Well, he doesn't think that dogs were deliberately interacting with each other through these activities.
Instead, they think that dogs have learnt from their own experience what they should be concerned about and who they don't.
He said: If you meet the other dogs many times, and if they shake your tail on the one side again then it is more friendly and the right part presents less friendly behaviour, you react on the basis of the same experience.
Researchers say that these conclusions can give better information to employers, animals and trainers.
John Bradhan, an expert on the treatment of dogs, said that it is not the first study for dogs to investigate whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year the team of University of Linkan found that when dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their heads towards the left and when they look at the happy dog, they turn their heads towards the right.
In other research on University of Victoria in Canada, he said: There was more chance of reaching the dog than that of the robot dog on the left side when it was shaken by the tail of the dog instead of the right.
He said that this difference was because in different studies dogs or robots didn't fully understand dogs in films.
He made it clear that the way to respond to the dogs can help.
When there are enough evidences from various breasts that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, there are still more detailed information ; and in this case dogs are not exception he said.
However, looking at how easy it can be written, we don't think it's probably too much time to understand why their misery sometimes moves towards the other side.

Dr. Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
On Thursday he announced that Pope Francis 22th February, for the first time in his work on February, he would make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church.
cardinals, there are supreme ministers in the Catholic Church, their post is only below the Pope, and these people choose the Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his own people who will eventually help choose their successor.
There are 201 cardinals right now.
In fact, after reaching 80 years of age, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in his election-this comes into the group of 120cardal elections.
In a statement he declared that the meeting of all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony of compensation of new cardinals, which is called the Maharaja Sabha.
Lombardani said,  Louis Francis has already decided to make his decision to hold the Pope-General of February so that it may be easier to plan other meetings which are shared from different countries from different countries of the world.
Dravijez's Jack Valero said that by February there was potential to reduce the number of cardinal electoral electors.
He said that, according to the number of cardinal electoral elections, as much less than 120 and as many cardinals as he likes, and as many as 80 years old, declare the name of cardinals.
Valerro said that, the next year's Popya Sabha would be important because this year after Francis was elected in March, this will be the first Pope-General.
Currently, there is one kind of prejudice towards Europe and particularly Italy.
He said, It's interesting to see whether new popes, even from the rest of the world to replace balance.
There are 40 per cent Roman Catholics in South America, but there is very little number in cardinals.
France has the cardinal Council - which is eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to search for reform methods of the church, these are also the first cardinals to be selected after the formation.
Before this, he decided everything.
Valerro said, All these eight cardinals have chosen to help themselves.
He said that it was possible to ask French cardinals for advice.
But we're not already in this situation - it's totally new.
Valerro said that, generally, the priests of large places give the cardinal post, but Francis was quite surprised - so we don't know whose name they will declare.

the disappointment of Obama's voters
I voted twice than change Obama twice.
He says that because of the policy of resistance of GOP, Obama's greatest efforts have been interrupted.
The policy of blocking, Obamakeyer website, does n't offer an excuse for drone attacks.
Obama's memory reminds us of what could have happened
Nathian P. Moris is a second year student in Harvard Medical School.
I read very painful books today.
This is a book about which I think it will inspire me during my second year in medical school and give me hope.
It's called Hazi and it's the year 2008 presidential election campaign of Obama.
When I go to bed with my patients at night, this book takes me to a period in which politics inspired millions of people and speech could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be as follows, and the news speakers broke out to show the historical importance of that period.
My cousins were happy in their eyes, and my parents saved every news letter.
There was a group of young telescopes going to White House, and the entire country was ready to change.
In 2008, when he became the President of Obama, he had 82 per cent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a hard truth, such as coming back from the world of dreams.
It's difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to remember a far away, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
My first vote was actually changed after I went to vote.
Simplely, none of them could even imagine it.
I credit Obama with a lot of achievements, from Ardable's Allowance to Return Our Army to Iraq, say,Don't ask me again till Osama Bin Laden died.
Apart from this, I believe that the policy of protesting discrimination has prevented many efforts to advance our country. In which local reforming, public options for health services, housing facilities, etc. are included.
But a▁संख्या-time in which I took my side of the Obama administration before colleagues and colleagues, and finally I got the answer that I could give to them.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Republican's opposition policy is not the answer of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to the drone attack on innocent children abroad.
This National Security agency cannot reply to collecting data about the private life of American citizens nor can it answer the charges against the people who show wrong acts of the government.
It can't explain the reason for the murder of non-conventional American citizens ; nor during President Campen, less than public fund and income limits.
It cannot answer the findings of the report which says that the attempt by White House to silence the media has been the most aggressive since its administration.
And most recently, even after three years after it was signed by Ashdable Ket, it can not prove the failure of designing a simple website.
I don't know if I expected it.
If, at 18 years of age, I should have estimated that the government system could deny the political campaign which brought it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a Eastanum route, because opposition political parties and memorable events such as Newtown City, New Zealand, give shape to our public discussion.
Even so, most of the examples I have given above seem to have been selected by the administration.
This bothers you most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidates.
Devi presented a confused and uncertain option which didn't appear to determine their policies or their post.
I thought, for Obama, another work period, which will be free from pressure from future elections, will fulfill those hopes about which we've been listening long ago.
However, while Obama 's indian rating is less than 45 per cent this week, through that book it makes it very difficult to return to 2008.
Seeing her I remember her promises have gone away.
In this week there was reading a portion of the book, which described how in Penisvenia, Soniai, Clinton had a huge loss due to the loss of Clinton.
In a post-Matum Campen meeting he told his subordinate servants that they needed to return to the track and need to remain true to their objectives.
He said,I want to get my Mojo back
We should remember who we are.
Today after five years, President, I can't agree with you anymore.

Arabi M.P.P.P.P. Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abut is interested in the Plan of Punjac, because their daughters can become pregnant and can take advantage of it.

But Mr. Palmer has claimed that there can only be a struggle for ministers and that the daughters of mint can benefit personally from policies.

Mr. Palmer asked for elections to proceed faster than he did.
The daughters of Tony Etote, Francisco and Bridge.
Should election result in two months after we vote?
He said,We should have a better system.
Why can't we have a system in which we fill our computer, vote immediately, and get results at 6:30.
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of Pensil for marking the papers.
That's because if someone doesn't like it then we can erase it?
It's absurd to use pencil in today's times.
Election Commission is studying options for electronic votes and recently issued a joint discussion with NewGland.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his policies include building international airports for Patel and he would take his new job seriously.
Public post is for public service.
He said,We need no awards except that we can serve the community at this critical time.

RBS took two years to traders
The Royal Bank of Scottland has converted two traders into its foreign exchange department, from two persons who know this information from the case, this is another indication that there is going to be a global inquiry rate going on through the suspect market.
UBS Baracez, Dush Bank and RBS have confirmed that the biggest financial market in the world which exchanges $5.3 crores per day, in research they are collaborating with organisations.
These two traders will be the first staff of RBS, who are examined by the case which appears to be rediscovered by liberation loans.
The bank has refused to comment on Narmbran and has confirmed that the bank has received the request for information from the organisations this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said,Our investigation continues on this issue, and we're doing full cooperation with FCA and other organisations.
Last month, people who were familiar with the case said that RBS sent the former trader and sent records of the email and quick messages received from him to the UK organisation, financial welfare authority.
This trader named Richard▁वोer left RBS in 2010 and it is believed that it has been released from its present post in J.P.moregenan head of Europe trading.
In the city, mainly of European spots, Ramachandani went last week to leave, whereas in Barlas and UBS, former senior taxpayer was transferred by Standen Chartard this week.
None of these traders have been accused of doing anything wrong.
People who were familiar with the case told that there are Barlaages and Criticcies in the fast message group of M.U.S.
UBS said that, after it was told by Sivataka, Jainma that he was doing research on foreign currency market in many self-interests, this week he has acted against some of his employees.
At least six rights on global level - Europe commissions, Jainma, Shritisland's competition with power, FCA, Justice Department of Justice in US and Hong Kong are examining the charges to take their favour to the banking market.
People familiar with the case told that, HSBC, City, J.P.moreorgan, and credit has also made internal investigations, or has requested information from organisations.
Banks are carefully examining messages and email in search of clues for wrong activities.
The news about investigations caused disturbances in sector traders, which have been amongst the most profitable people in the trading unit of investment banks for many years, but they have to face this challenge because there has been a shortage of opportunities for consumers.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to make amends in the big and most expensive foreign exchange market but it is not necessary for senior traders to say that it is true.
The senior trader said that despite the enormous magnitude of foreign exchange trade trade- sales, apart from the different trading platforms, the increasing use of Liquidity and the increasing use of its own platforms through banks means that you can begin to influence the market on less tickets value.
This news came on the same day when credit was announced by Sushi from his Examined Trade Fund desk in London to trader this week which was lost by nearly $6 million at the end of the last year.
The bank immediately notified the harmonious authority and was collaborating with its organisations.
Thank you so well said that we believe traders worked alone and controlled it.

In contrast with the claims of Modi, in the reign of NDA(between 1999 and 2004), a period came during the stay of Atal Vajpayee during two years(2002) no ads were issued by the government.
On Thursday, on March 182, Mahattar Patel founded 182 meters high,and said, Before this, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Jayat Patel Patel's victoryers.
whereas DVP records show that YouTube spent 30 million in 2009-10, 2010-11 Rs 4.10 crores in 2011-12, 2.7 million rupees in 2012-13.

forwarding through mud, rivers and forests to provide medical care
Dr. George Weel, giving health care to the rural areas of Cameroon.
Weal and his team watch hundreds of patients on each weekend.
West African countries don't have lots of doctors; there's only one doctor for 5,000 people
Give your votes here or send through mobile
Dr. George Weel is one of the 10 heroes in the top of C.N. in 2012.
You can vote for them or for anyone else on top 10 for making C.N. years hero.
The winning person will get 250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Well had seen his sick father coming to his senses and unconscious, going to hospital, who were not suitable to help him.
Zemail Val, in 1981, was injured in car accident near the capital of Cameroon.
In the beginning he had only broken hands, but there was an infection which spread to his brain, and made blood clotting, which affected his rest life.
Georges Well says,There wasn't any news in Karmaran.
If we had money we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Vell used to travel with his father with a large crowd of clinics and hospitals and whatever treatment he could get.
She said,It's not easy.
You leave home at five o'clock in the morning with hope that you will be the first person coming to hospital, but it doesn't happen.
There are lots of patients there.
Some people can sit in the mouth of death waiting and waiting.
After Vedal's father's death in 2002, things didn't change very much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician for every 50,000 person in Cameroon.
If compared, then in United States there is a physician for every 413 persons.
And even if there's a doctor there, many of you who live there can't afford it.
In India two out of five people live below poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in health service in the country is private sector.
Well says, The only problem they have is poverty
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Vedal decided to solve some of it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have done 700 medical research last year.
He himself became a physician, and started working as such a cellular surgeon in Yondender Hospital.
And he started non-terrorist organisation Acovoyam, which goes to rural areas on the weekend to provide medical services.
Since 2008, he and his own group helped about 33,000 people.
About Friday they sit in the van and around 30 people. They bind medical supplies with roof and go to rural areas where people need medicine.
Sometimes luck doesn't happen with him.
They have to push the vehicle out of rivers and soil.
But when they reach, they actually get the respect of heroes: the best house to be brought up by the feast, singing and dancing and community.
In these villages, health care service is really reason to celebrate, and Vell - along with his big smile and endless energy - it includes happiness and joy.
Next morning his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
We're meeting 500 people every journey.
They come from village to village about 60 km away, and they walk on.
These weekend clinics provide different medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, malaria, malnutrition, pneumonia and sexually transmitted diseases.
other people can get glasses, alms, etc. - this document takes priority in school, but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening the party performs simple surgery with local noun.
Operation is usually performed at school, Town Hall or home; after procedure, the patient goes to a lonely place and makes room for the next person.
Group's generator is published in rooms and in telephoneization equipment, and heil and his factories work on Sunday morning and morning.
It's a waisty pace, but the village musicians generally help keep the team inspired.
He said,They keep us seated and keep us busy all night to continue their work.
On Sunday his party returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including Cameroon's physician and foreign medical students - last year 700 million surgery, and they know that their help can change the world of people they help.
One person said that due to surgery he would be able to go back to work again.
The man said,It will change the future of me and my family.
Apart from conducting a weekly clinic and working as an surgeon in the hospital, he also works on a personal medical clinic around the night.
He told them that it was his second job which finances 60% of his non-official work ; the rest is filled with private donation.
I don't know when they're sleeping, he said, that they don't know when they're going to go.
They're always in hospital, or they're trying to make money for their organisation, so that they keep running these campaigns.
O'Meli's medical and nursing students who come from United States and Europe to join the Vedal campaign, this is a practical opportunity which they can never achieve in their country.
O'Meli said, In the medical science we help catch the tools for Dr. Volel or clean blood spots, we've been able to achieve practical experience.
You will never get the chance to do this as a professional student of second year in America.
They usually spend from their own home to reach Cameroon, and they usually come along with the medical facilities of charity.
But after they reach puberty they are going to stay, and they carry costs of instruction.
O'Meli says,There's no doubt that they're hero.
They give their lives for this organisation, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Vell, almost the same load of work, it's not difficult.
Helping other people to live happy lives, fulfill their promise to their father, these are things which give them great joy.
Well says,I'm very happy when I do this work.
And I think about my dad.
I hope they're looking at what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.
