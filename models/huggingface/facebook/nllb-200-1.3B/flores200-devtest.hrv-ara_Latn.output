When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
Satellite in space receives a call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
Satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the view.
To send a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a huge rocket over 100 feet high.

below them are medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
After all, many small cats (including house cats) eat much larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, or a special position that a single cat occupies, so that it does not have to compete with others.
Leos are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called herds.
The lion herds consist of one to three closely related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related and make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave similarly to wolf or dog herds, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour, and are also very deadly to their prey.

The tiger belongs to the same group (genus panther) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but rather a series of incomprehensible, screaming words.
The ocelots eat small animals, like monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find predators by smell, by sniffing where prey has moved on the ground.
They see very well in the dark with their night vision and they move very unnoticed. They hunt their prey so they blend in with their surroundings and then they jump on the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, during a crossing over a mountain or river or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
The new environment means different resources and different competition, and the new population needs characteristics or adaptations different from the previous ones in order to compete for resources.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still have to make the same adjustments as before.

In time, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the creation of new species. Species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which humans breathe and then take in carbon dioxide which humans exhale.

Mosasaurus was the leading predator in its time so it was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw had over 70 sharp teeth along with an extra set of teeth on his nipple which means there was no help for anyone who got in his way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a wide tongue, and his diet consisted of turtles, big fish, and other mosasaurs, and maybe even a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex couldn't keep up.
Though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicacies that included wild pigs, peacocks, snails, and pupae.
Another difference was that poor men and women ate sitting at tables, whereas rich men enjoyed communal feasts where they ate on their sides.
The ancient Romans' meals could not have contained the ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia over the following centuries.
They didn't know about corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and nobody in ancient Rome ever tasted purines.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by performing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was open only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramids formed towers, called gyurates, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of the life of a Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, shops were open-air stalls, stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. Norwegian sagas tell us that Erik the Red, after being banished from Iceland for murder, on his way west, discovered Greenland and gave it the name.

n the American War of Independence, 13 states, by means of the Articles of Confederation, first established a weak central government consisting solely of Congress.
Congressional power was not to tax, and since there was no state or judicial authority, all the acts were enforced by the authorities, who often did not cooperate.

The Treaty needed to be amended with the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were often absent.

still being made today, but more importantly, the same ratio has been set for image sensor formats in digital cameras.
It's a little confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The width-height ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio expressed in prime integers) is therefore 3: 2.
Many common formats (for example APS formats) are equal to or closest to this image width-height ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often violated and ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamics with some degree of order in the picture.
The most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).


The powerful power of Christianity influenced everyone from the king to the common man.

The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has caused many to question whether they adhere to that principle.

The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
UK mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, posing a danger to ships of neutral parties.
As there was little interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.

Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job with Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (a businessman at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a distinctive dynasty.
The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between the nobles for the throne.

The same goes for the army, because after the revolution, ranks were awarded based on ability, not rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond the confines of his boring life. The cave that became known as the "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) was visited by him to be able to think better".
The cave that has survived throughout history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
t, it's not easy to find it at all, even if you know for sure it exists.t once you find yourself in a cave, you're completely isolated.
Can't see anything except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
The Pyramid of Cheops, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
"The Giza Pavilion or ""Necropolis at Giza"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wives of the Pharaoh Khufu and members of his family.
"The ""upward motion with a hook" tag looks like a V and a ""downward motion with a hook"" like a connector or a square without a bottom page".
Up means start at the top and push the reed, and down means start at the frog (where you hold the reed with your hand) and pull the reed.
A raised cymbal usually produces a softer sound, while a lowered cymbal is more powerful and imposing.

The war expenses of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs, and the interest on the bonds was exchanged through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.

To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the Order was created.
The Middle Ages, or the High Middle Ages, is the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has impacts on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it might be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.

Car ownership is driving more road accidents, leading to the discovery of new techniques in health care for treating injuries.

In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography appear that are consistent with the physical abode of society, and therefore are better than arbitrarily imposed laws.

It was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400 A.D. to about 1100 A.D.
The status deteriorated in the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
at this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
,,,,,,,,,
Through the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.One of the greatest discoveries of the time as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons on clothing.
self-sustaining farming is farming to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds in native ecoregions in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture special can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often show their belonging by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite examples of unfortunate cases where children have not been socialized by adults during their adulthood, either as a result of neglect, accident or intentional abuse.
Some wild children are taken captive by humans (mostly their own parents). In some cases, the abandonment of a child is the result of the parent's refusal to acknowledge that their child has severe intellectual or psychological impairment.
Wild children may experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild.
If raised entirely by animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within body boundaries) that are almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raised it, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, setting the scale goes a step further.
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
The scales can be virtual and real; in other words, the teacher is a form of scale, like the animated connector that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
Virtual scale setting is internalised in the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures which may be too challenging for the student to solve on his/her own.
Children are placed in the foster care system for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, caring and educational, and yet it is happening.
We maintain that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care should meet all the needs that are missing in the home they're taken from.
Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The identifiable features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are cited as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)."
"When investigating visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" as new motivational aspects".
The use of video has made important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
The Commission has also assessed the impact of the measures on the environment and the environment.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, argues that individuals who cannot understand speech because of brain injury can still accurately assess its honesty.
He suggested that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
20th century studies have shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection is the removal from the set of expressed variations.
segregation and recombination in each generation shift the variability between these two sources.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their need for amino acids from available plant sources.
n't fail has serious consequences: shorter growth, poor nutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources were leaf proteins and fungus proteins, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest uncooked.
The food of animals (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also contains large amounts of proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids.
"All in all, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the "protein intake problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do today in the savannah".
Sleep interruption is the act of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and going back to sleep sometime later (10  60 minutes).
This is possible by simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock to come to your senses without being completely awake.

Other biorhythmic options include consuming lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which makes you wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the life force is present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.

Tibet buddhism is based on the teachings of buddha but is spread by the mahajana love path and many techniques from indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle.It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, differences in systems, practices and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the war ended, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and lead to really powerful armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.

Transporting goods by ship is certainly the most efficient way for large numbers of people and large quantities of goods to cross the ocean.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
one of the most important recent examples was the north atlantic campaign during world war ii. the americans tried to move manpower and material across the atlantic ocean to help the british.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
lf the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would have probably succeeded in conquering Britain, as it had succeeded in conquering the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Pitome goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hillsides and other pastures, and were kept by so-called kozars, usually children or adolescents, a name for shepherds who guard goats.

Though the first wooden wagon tracks consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed the horses to pull the wagons faster and to pull more cargo than would have been possible on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.

This became common practice, but iron caused the wooden wheels to wear out.
The first fully iron railways were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Biped walking has been observed in Australopithecus since about 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
can join environmental movements and we can even be activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment, but unless we seek a solution that is only temporary, we need to find the root of these problems and neutralize them.

After Congress passed the draft on July 4th, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printer.

Pratically all computers in use today are based on handling information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary characters or bits in computer jargon.
Poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
On the label, look for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists in an official sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the well-known rockets, insects that have adapted very well to parasitize humans.
Killer and common rockets depend on their hosts, whose nests or living spaces they live in.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Such couples can give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method, and this method is actually the guideline for most scientific research.

Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed ties with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The numerous recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not just responses to external cyclic stimuli, have been discovered in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the period of free cycles even if there are no external signs.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proponents of DNA as genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that showed DNA in a phosphorus radioactive phage or a protein phage with a radioactive sulfur.
mutations can have a lot of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether germline cells are affected.
only mutations in the sex cells can be passed on to the children whereas other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the plant and animal world.
examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks and studying ecosystem information.

In this dynamic transport scenario, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. almost everyone complains about transportation systems.

Why are transport systems the subject of so many complaints; why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something much bigger?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and to find food and steam more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Today, the only insects that can't fold wings are the fairy horse and the water lily.

The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some point six miles wide.
