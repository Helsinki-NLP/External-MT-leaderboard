Inflation in Europe falls on food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 eurozone countries was greater than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office located in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the direct interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, along with rising commodity prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below but close to 2 percent.
According to one analyst, this is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "it is necessary to deter" inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the eurozone has dropped due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Cereal futures market quotas increased by 88 percent and soybean price also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, global oil prices rose by 52 percent and last month a barrel of black gold cost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 percent but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate over 12 months remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the key interest rate twice in 2008.
Gallup Signs Government Crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December.So since 2002, it currently has the highest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute of Survey) has never seen such a low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For the loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
On the faithful voters certain to go vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous low point, the proportion of those who judged that the economic situation of the country was serious has never been so high, it rises to 41 percent and according to 46 percent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population anticipates an aggravation and only a tenth anticipates an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of people surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, thought the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the prime minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 percent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, at present this rate represents only 20 percent.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 percent of respondents said they would definitely vote and another 20 percent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would participate and 15 percent additional would likely participate. Following current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would have no doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to enrollment fees in higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees and 84 percent would say no to hospital spending.
When we look only at the same proportions of people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters, respectively, would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital spending.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco increased its prices by 20 percent
The hypermarkets located in the commercial triangle of Budaörsined the average price increase of 16 percent from last year, with the difference that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article from Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase of well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, “which had already flown” in major grocery stores last December, no longer rose sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 this value was 6 800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but the prices of turkey nuts, nuts and peaches have risen sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics), but at Auchan, one kilogram of bread was found at only 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the ordered bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the ordered bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of Daily Cart, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent, respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket of last year and the cheapest basket of this year, we find a difference of 12 percent while the difference between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive basket of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,484 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticeable in last year’s Christmas prices.
This process confused trade, hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply to products because they were unable to predict the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risks losing a large profit on the margin tailored to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the price of the Daily basket has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was higher by 1 720 forints than the value of 2006 while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was 1630 forints higher than last year and the prices of the cheapest rose by 1,284 forints as well.
By bringing the two seasons closer to Christmas, we saw a catastrophic price rise, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods rose by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some basic foods, the statistical institute found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
This seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has risen by barely more than 10 percent from the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get multinational companies to accept the sharp price hike as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets they visit.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-lasting foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, significant queues were formed at the box office of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased abruptly.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they are not even reaching the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by improper use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make savings on disinfectants
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the János Hospital traumatology department.
Antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected in a man who was hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident left the hospital but soon after he had to return there due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to do a major operation because of the bacteria that is in his body.
As of December 10, this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Center for Epidemiology.
That is, the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium in their nose without developing any disease.
SA-caused infections (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant antibiotic bacterium that will proliferate quickly in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly, low-weight or weakened patients.
According to the head doctor of the hospital János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
We should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA alone or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
They are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, care staff put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have suitable antibiotics to treat them,” Nyulasi said.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined for MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion.
The vast majority of MRSA-caused infections could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favorable to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Because this infection is most common in hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases only emerge if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief medical officer of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient and primary care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs spread from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore crucial to wash hands, wear gloves and protective masks.H, significant gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact, however, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemics, the sick should be kept at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, save on disinfectants, lack nurses, there are many sick people, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
The Government's Project Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why this infection is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSAs.
According to the published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identifies among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The police officer, who committed a fatal accident, was not drunk.
The official statement concerning the fatal accident caused by the commissary of the 22nd district has been drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the 22nd district commissioner, who has resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, Attila Morvai, a spokeswoman for the capital's public prosecutor's office, said on Friday after the relative finding was established.
The findings confirmed the first outcome of the investigation that already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before taking the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former 22nd district police chief crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, on 22nd district Kossuth Lajos Street.
(Furthermore, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian passage is not an mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that begins a curve must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident has greatly upset him.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the outset with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements worth a total of €400 million on a loan line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of €300 million for Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, with a loan agreement of €100 million already signed by the parties.
The €150 million loan agreement also covers the budget financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary, the remaining €150 million can be used later, following the extension of the loan agreement.
The parties signed a contract of €50 million for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the subway line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would reconsider the possible modification of the original contract once Hungary has finalised the details of the subway financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of €8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits at the EURIBOR interest rate, with a limitation period of 8 years and no commitment commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate market of the EU
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little cited in the past.
What, or and who bought in this EU market that is still the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most fashionable destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly in search of a building in the Kavarna and Balcik area as well.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also increasingly many to buy in the very inexpensive corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, shops and office areas promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe and thus a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy a building in Bulgaria at the same time seek to change their lives, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea shores and in the most reputable ski resorts, we traditionally meet a lot of Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old broken houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary homes (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving value-added in the medium or long term.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly rising due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in property prices largely exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which should define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol emissions reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there are lively discussions between developing countries and developed countries on this subject.
The United States also that at the moment it does not want to discuss exact figures, but was ready to sign an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, in addition to emissions reduction, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors composed of 16 members likely within the framework of the UN Global Fund for the Environment (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
6% of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water, confirms the EU’s ambition to retain its role as an admiral vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the successful signing of the “Agreement after 2012”, and is ready to reduce them by up to 30 percent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also willing to take commitments tailored to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signing the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 percent and all 15 member states of the EU at that time made the commitment of 8 percent less.
Hungary has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, the Ministry of the Environment said in a press release.
The challenge is great in Bali as the long-term international climate policy agreement must be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would be postponed after 2012.In this case, reduction commitments below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new international emission reduction system whose necessity was stressed in the new report of the IPCC, the international scientific body, which won the Nobel Peace Prize of the United Nations, in charge of dealing with climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and an increase in Earth’s average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
British military units share on the video sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to make themselves popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has become passionate about YouTube: the special units intervening in Afghanistan upload videos there on the operations carried out against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken with the help of miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London or compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable.
The air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defense registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the air force's initial goal, the videos were posted on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defense, they also served to make the general public aware of the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published by this route costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, said Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, to the BBC.
The Americans played a game.
The army is upset because, in addition to the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have passed onto the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in “official” propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, officers don’t avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Moreover, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in real missions, but the British army has only recently embarked on loading these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the America's Army shooting game downloadable for free.In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and beignets in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking beetles and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, yet another will delight officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so entertains the power.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense, but it will not be the ministry employees who will be invited.
At Christmas, orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere at the end of the year.
Compared to other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the gross six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a public procurement company.
The building of the Theatre de la Gaîté was rented for this purpose.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to contact the person in charge.
Dress is not mandatory.
The ILO building hosted not only the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a dance on St. Luke’s Day on December 7.
The ILO did not charge them for using their rooms.
The ball numbered 500 people.
The party began with the minister’s welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Evening dress was not compulsory at this ball at all.
Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Communities are preparing a sober celebration.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite its employees to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat beetles, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Governments, will simply invite his employees to take a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Governments and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room where 436 employees are expected to attend.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
There is no planned festive atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the exhibition of the minister but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the Town Hall, and according to the ministry’s communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, held every year, begin with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services told [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The mega strike forces are gathering.
The League’s unions and the National Association of Workers’ Councils will constitute their strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s indefinite strike.
A general protest assembly will be held on Saturday and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will cause significant traffic jams as railway traffic will be almost completely stopped and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 13:00.
The League’s trade unions will announce on Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers’ Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be formed, serving as the coordinator of Monday’s actions.
A general protest assembly will be held on Saturday and, starting Monday, organisations joining the strike will stop working indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the law on health funds, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what to do next.
According to the National Assembly’s Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the health funds law will only take place late in the evening, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, significant traffic congestion is planned: railways will stop work indefinitely and during the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being shut down.
At the same time, in different points of the country, half the road will also be blocked.
Many unions and civil society organizations have joined the strike call, the list of which is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organizations report to go on strike indefinitely, others have declared a temporary shutdown.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railroad Syndicate (VDSZSZ) have failed to reach an agreement on the minimum services, but, as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest’s public transport will strike from the start of service until 13:00, the Budapest airport between 7 and 9 am, the Electricity and Thermal Energy Industry Unions of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers’ Union and the Democratic Teachers’ Union have called for a strike for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will go on strike across the country alternately, while the Syndicate of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ) affiliated with the SZEF will go on a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, demands that the government withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires the new method of calculating pensions to be introduced from next year to be introduced in several stages.
The third claim wants a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the functions that deserve it to pass into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railroad Workers’ Union (VDSZSZ), affiliated with the League’s Trade Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increased Country Risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company points out that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic confrontations may occur as a result of the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Zigeon and non-Zigeon population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main gaps of Hungarian political actors: “public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians.”
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are being strengthened and the advent of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007 giving themselves the name of "National Association of Self-Defense".
“The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defense missions (catastrophes, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, in addition, evoking the incompetence of the police, the army, that is, the state,” they added.
They that everything was going according to the method that, based on the resentment of society from politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on the civil character and association status is therefore only used to avoid the legal traps of registering these associations in court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
In recent months, many neighboring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultranationalist political actors in some neighboring countries have sought to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma riots that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to form a guard by saying that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense.”
According to them, in the last 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, the Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative had sparked a lively debate in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations about setting up their own guard as resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not rule out that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, Political Capital’s risk warning read.
At the telegraph agency’s request for information, Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could impact the change in risk, they inform the public, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law precisely defines holidays and, around holidays, it has become commonplace to reorganize working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and days of rest.
Holidays are often associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter especially so that the awakeners can rest peacefully.
In one year, there are 11 festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as is October 23 also which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the constitution of our state, on 1 May is Labor Day and on 1 and 2 November we remember our deceased family members and friends.
In addition, we have two days in Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday preceding the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has decided in a special regulation on the replacement days of days before or after holidays.
The law extends to all employers and to all their employees employed, to officials and to persons working in the public service.
It does not apply, however, to service companies, to institutions that are constantly operating and in service, because of their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year, working days will change only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life almost stops across the country because according to experiences most people rather do overtime or take holidays they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the work day to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a day of rest on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly upset colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that “embellish” the everyday of a workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these troubles or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
and examples.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department,” a colleague told you.
Did you miss an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, this is arranged with excuses.
Before having any painful explanations, it’s worth thinking about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There is nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Remember that the day before you put the cloth on the desk, it disappeared the next morning?
Do you find your pen that you thought was lost on your friend’s desk?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking, otherwise they are right to be angry with you for having struck their good.
Do not bring back envelopes, post it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need them right away.
Do you care about the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop pimples spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell anyone your information (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares their intimate secrets with you, don’t misuse their trust!
Enter the information shared within yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you sick for no reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a cracking headache because you feel bad or feel you need rest that day, think of the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future tasks must be done by someone else in your place.
Do not bother your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you won’t work the next day or that something might happen that would force you to stay at home, don’t forget to warn your boss and colleagues to prevent them from wondering about your absence the next day.
Snooping, Snooping and Phone
Do you get stuck in your work, but your colleagues’ rancor brings you out of it?
Did you become, unwillingly, a witness to a phone conversation that you would have better not listened to?
Don’t disturb your colleagues with chanting, chanting, loud discussions (which you lead above their head), footbeats, loud words, or discontent expressed loudly.
They can bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the time limit, you forget to send a mail or important message, don’t blame anyone for that forgetting!
Do not put it on the account of the potential chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has brought inconvenience to others, correct the mistake!
Ask how you can repair your fault, repair your negligence.
Do you feel at home at the office?
Put a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Don’t put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your job requires it by wearing beautiful and stylish clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interesting.
We move slowly into the usual morning hole.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I raise the sound.
The music changes the rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones of the whole time, then a female choir comes together as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcast Zagar's song Wings of Love.
The Hungarian musical life has not ruined us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now, it seems that the tap becomes different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Pécs and he himself played in the Yonderboi group before he started his own path, because “there is no room for two feet in the same shoe.”
His project (Zagar) and his music, a blend of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török.
The formation playing initially in small clubs began to become known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would be as competitive in the West.
Zagar and his team have undoubtedly become “trendy” but no one has asked them if they want to wear that label.
The band reacted properly and released a new and better record.
The album titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent a continuation with the years spent in Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the former Pecs group of Balázs Zságer.
We are there well with the reference to the flight but next to the air music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs at the debut of the album at Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, has begun to introduce the songs of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube drives me to ask a question: has your music remained a music targeting a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music targeting a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
Alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also regardless of language or boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only young people of about ten or twenty years of age but also the elderly.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B: I’m obviously pleased to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made for a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is perceived only in the inscrutable changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you would no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you plan to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and had a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust in each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many leaving his band and taking a different path.
hvg.hu: On the score of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love ranks first.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, have you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t plan to make a tube to sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgia of sounds and the more difficult themes covered throughout the album.
HVG.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why did they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian musical scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This song had already existed for a long time in an instrumental version, and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from that song.
The sequence of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang at night the same melody that the girls learned later.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice she’t have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a single role, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were behind the stage, too.
Is it wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
What was voluntary, however, was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes, or just let those wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
HVG.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: To be honest, none in the process of musical creation, we had more difficult tracks when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything set up like a puzzle.
Q: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “left” this record.
Currently, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Cheating trader risks billions due to inferiority complex
A hidden fraudster.
This is the name of his former employee, the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost 5 billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, can not be considered unable at all.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
“He is fragile,” his superiors told police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's statement by French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros.
Crisis Exceeds the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had encountered reimbursement difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel did not believe it and he bet well.
At the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I had earned my first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confesses and adds that he has, of course, kept nothing for himself."
During the interrogation, he admitted to misrepresentation in order not to be spotted.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to get interested in his transactions.
He who does not risk has nothing.
Was he afraid to be discovered?
rather not.
"I estimated that the mere fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get to take such a big risk?
He only progressively reached his position.
He began working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less regarded than others.
In view of my academic course and my professional and personal journey," Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after his entry into office, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of that equity during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we’ll leave you alone.
“There was like a snowball effect,” he told the police.
But the leaders knew everything, or rather they doubted it.
“As long as I was winning, they pretended to close their eyes.”
This is when the start of the year occurs.
They lost a billion dollars in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how was it discovered?
He became suspicious because of his holidays.
Last year, I only took 4 days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to someone else,” Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion CZK) to the Czech Republic.
This is roughly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly SEK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will receive approximately 100 billion SEK from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to $150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational program and represents up to 22 percent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain in the framework of these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of SEK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to raise funding to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new and more effective management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic was among the least successful recipients of EU funds among the new members.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20-year prison sentence for former president
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million (nearly SEK 1.8 billion) fraud.
However, he was later released and lived in residence detention in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be imprisoned again is not yet clear, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that German regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictional companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of that money went to the funds German had created to fund his 2001 election campaign.
The budget was adopted
It is so.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget drafted by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
That for the current year was passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Unlike the bustling debate before the vote on the government’s declaration of mistrust, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives passed this law without any problems, which, though the most influential, is usually overlooked.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and end of every government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media, which is why it is given more attention in the media.
The disputes of politicians interest the public much more than the abrupt numbers.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is unable to settle at once:
The first is the significant share granted to the expenses of mandates imposed by law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" gathering the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that is the biggest problem.
This is public and relatively controlled.
The real bomb of delay is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often emitted bonds, overly indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain, besides money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by selling massive shares of the distribution systems, those of energy, obtained from the state in the context of privatizations.
They no longer have that source.
If only official and verifiable facts are taken into account, it can be found that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for several years now, and ČSSD is looking forward to it.
This was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have handled their affairs much more reasonably than our republic.
This is a monstrous disgrace that basically falls on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are globally the least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, we do not need massive social programs that have unfortunately become unnecessarily bloated in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, has been eliminated, if a retirement age shift, as well as a reform of the pension system, do not take place soon, then all politics will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power will only administer.
With little exaggeration, we can say that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That’s why the current budget can’t be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes ordinary expenses repelled by mandate expenses.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not wasted all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become simple bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will progressively a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the currency markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
As an example, the U.S. Federal Reserve will auction $40 billion and, in addition, provide $24 billion to European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual states have decided on such a concerted action, aimed at preventing or even mitigating the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group in his customer report.
"The concerted action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts expect additional billions of dollars.
“If central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they have to really understand what can still follow,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“He says the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would lower consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after they failed to lower London’s interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual loans, despite the U.S., Canadian and British central banks having repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank’s move will not contribute to conjuring the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem that is the fall in the U.S. real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologists’ debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to hurt especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has again addressed the problem of global warming.
Criticism came this time at the UN Climate Change Conference that ended in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not Green, he stated that environmentalists’ debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference that there is between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured there at all, it is just a rocket of words, replacing solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions."
Now interested persons can read his positions without distorting them.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he still has, in his opinion, enough dispositions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, so changes in it are normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too significant nor too serious, so they pose no danger, and finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unchecked opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from the people present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against “a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring.”
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people have failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers left the deadline to expire and failed to renew their old driving license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still apply for renewal, so the authorities are in the way to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid license will take the road.
According to the authorities, they did not renew their driving license especially those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities report a decline in the number of applications for renewal of permits, authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of applications for renewal of permits has gone up this week.
The municipality satisfies approximately 2,000 customers per day.
There is a half-hour queue.
In Prague, 140,000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional fee of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to complete the mandatory renewal of their driving license by the end of the year and take the road without a valid license will be subject to fines from January.
The offender will be obliged to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence by resorting to an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative violation, the fine increases to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even a person who was not going to move was subject to a fine.
He could have been forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 kronor.
However, according to Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driver’s license is a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the identity card, which must be valid without exceptions.
Those who do not want to drive should return their driver’s license.
You just have to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid by the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to renew other types of driving licenses gradually.
Persons holding documents from 1994 to 2000 have three years to renew.
Driving licenses issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court reduced the sentences of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of conspiracy with David Berdych’s gang, will be sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
The Supreme Court in Prague finally sentenced them, reducing their sentences by one year and two years, respectively.
Initially, the detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime risked sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s judgment, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently waiting only for the verdict in the first instance.
However, he has already received in other trials sentences of more than 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the District Court found guilty for participation in hold-ups 19 people, the High Court today dealt with the appeal interjections of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have, since the start of the investigation, questioned the accusation, saying it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police, after an agreement, among others, with Berdych, transmitted to criminals information from police sources, covered up various hold-ups and helped gang members to avoid criminal liability.
In return, the gang gave 30 percent of the bullshit to Opava and Koňařík.
The charges are based on the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery whose victims, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During home searches, police found illegally held pistols, bullets with a steel core, a target for direct laser fire or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has made tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other hand-lifted robberies Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej are currently detained in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The cost of replacing children: 12 million
The lawyer Igor Veleba wants to obtain 12 million crowns plus the costs from the hospital in Třebíč.
Three million for each mother, two million for each father and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the hearing.
“In order to be able to make an opinion on the counterproposition, we need the expert report of which the opponent has commissioned the drafting.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands,” Dostál said.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov’s family demanded a million crowns for each month when they could not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, drafted for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the negotiations on compensation.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the present and in the face of what is happening right now, the content of the Veleba report summarized.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč Hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the governor of the Vysočina region, Miloš Vystrčil, awarded to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of the costs incurred by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are obliged by law to have civil liability insurance.
In case of failure, they must draw into the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute concerning the trademark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it was he who used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the actor's former collaborator.
Polívka was not present at today’s hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team parasitize on Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko remind everyone precisely of this actor and comedian.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Looking for money and developing events,” he said.
According to him, it is money that is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
Radoslav Brzobohatý was crowned king in 1993.
However, at the time, this had nothing to do with the plan to establish a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Valašské Království passports.
From an originally humorous action, a lucrative business and commercial activity emerged, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature be cited in the passport and he even offered holders a sale on the price of the visit to his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the manéž show, for commercial purposes.
“Boleslav Polívka’s popularity helped the Valašské království project,” the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who dedicated themselves intensively to the project.
The collaboration between the now enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka an official coronation in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected forever".
The ruling role in the kingdom was subsequently, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, a request that the court today rejected.
What could clear up the matter is the tournament considered for the throne and half the princess.
There should be a new king.
He did not yet want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king was elected for a period of time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course sign up," Harabiš added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were not extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, of the drive and also of the manufacturing could in many respects be classified as below average.
Currently, its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market.
Moreover, as the combi called SW goes a step further, I only have to think better.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about head space on the rear seats.
While there ended the complaints because the body combi means that even the big devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let’s see quickly.
I’ll talk about it soon so that I don’t repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about too short seats or files is over.
The side guidance was also significantly improved compared to Model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is also sensitive there.
The combi also sees disappear the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A box in the box
The most important part of the car is its luggage.
I have to rate this as very easily accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a fairly easy fitting.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not overwhelming and can be stretched while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let’s stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
The Škoda Fabia Combi is the best-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or charging a trolley, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the reversal of the rear seat backbacks perfectly right, or a very low foot.
120 horses distributed over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And really, this is what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback run.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression of having an exhaust pot blocked by a serpentine, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Go through the tariffs
The price of the car is not affordable for everyone.
However, one must be aware that we tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of a vehicle with an 1.4-litre Otto engine of 329,900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kčs.
In addition, we have head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic ice wipes, automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the car costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
That’s a lot, but try to add to the price of the Fabia the extra equipment and you’ll get a very similar figure.
Therefore, it is only necessary to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is going badly
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is growing, raising concerns about the development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of their native inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of northern Kent, where conflicts between remaining opponents and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, quarrels and quarrels between students have translated into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested in Chatham a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a iron bar.
The accused defended herself by claiming that the boy insulted her with racist words.
Police were also forced to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly addressed the man with racist remarks and threw him stones.
“When we got home, a young man climbed the bus stop and started spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he discovered his ass," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the others went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between indigenous inhabitants and immigrants is beginning to get tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your holidays can come true if you make a good choice.
Gold and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or drunk cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find this list not only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the warehouse and place of transfer of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings rose and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco from Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he owned his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today then?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, since the jigoles and fiats once imported have long since rotted in such a salty and humid climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly degraded, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are exactly there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had come back from the plantations spread out in the candy shops on a narrow path by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how you can see small locomotives running there, whose contemporaries are not found elsewhere only in museums.
Where to direct your footsteps?
Most visitors do not miss the most famous places.
Therefore, there is no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Other than reminding that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that those who love this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows there on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks rise in candlestick from the bottom of the valley, and, fertile soil having grabbed into their intestines, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is probably the place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can encounter the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana’s cigars factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar market that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth was embodied in the beauty and city-vitrine character of this small-size city.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněna pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, has almost not changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountainous massive Escambray, is a place so far apart that even in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
Nothing was built, and therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was content to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is also worth going to see interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Valley of Sucre.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is animated after sunset and where the music is obscured only in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some designate this town located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads leading there from Guantanamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without traces of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the East of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the former castle-fort and the current hotel El Castillo stands, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Truies and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patroness of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a number of pages.
But, as they say, it’s better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The shortage of soldiers and the necessary equipment influences, according to the United States, on the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight countries involved are now also discussing future plans and allied coordination.
While the United States this week through Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on NATO troops to be more active, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government’s authority and the intensification of development aid.
“The developments in Afghanistan are noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the residents to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
90 percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 percent from last year, to 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of them in the south.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as the ways to them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop made a similar statement.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
who is passive
In recent months, conflicts have also been raised between the countries involved on whether all allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as strict as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called this week the German soldiers lazy.
“Afghan swindlers discovered: the Germans are playing, while ours are fighting,” Sun wrote in a document supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to counterattack by publishing a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt to reach $1 billion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 crowns shall be borne by each Czech citizen.
The total debt rose at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to a better than expected development of the state budget savings, the ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
Thus, in the nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, it fell by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the state debt from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is borne by each Czech citizen.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could exceed the one trillion crown limit only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek to the server iHNed.cz.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: “We could exceed the billion in the course of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget, which is not yet known.
If it turned out that the situation on the political scene was changing, that politicians were willing to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The state debt is constituted by the central government debt and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
State debt is financed by treasury bonds, rent securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s external debt has increased this year from 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion.
The state’s so-called negotiable debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion crowns from June.
The average state debt requirement was 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased annually from the first half to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a much too high figure.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly by rent securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be material to negotiate when the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
It follows from the government’s financing and debt management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better than expected development of the state budget savings, the ministry reduced the planned sum to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the state budget, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns initially planned.
The following are the maximum sources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion SEK, the reserve of 10 billion SEK for pension payments, the financing of state pension securities of 43 billion SEK and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion SEK.
She appeared before a court in Khartoum today for naming a bear in a peluche
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-olds name a bear in a fur while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was punishable by a punishment of beating.
The 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with assault on Islam and sedition, under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class's fur bear.
“Eight names come out of the children’s mouths, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the classroom, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohammed as their favourite name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohammed".
The bear itself wore no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons’s Muslim colleagues, who taught at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting a religious belief, “I just regret that she asked children to vote for a name,” he said, “it is only an innocent mistake.”
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as “very attentive to her students” and “who never talks about religion in class.”
The name Mohammed is also the second most used name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
What are the rules for using this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiation session in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of talks without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a news conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region is "on the stake", its U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not anticipate violence right now, but we are entering a very difficult period," he said, adding that "evident tensions exist."
The end of the mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ishinger, Wisner and Russian Ombudsman Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The Baden talks, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was commissioned a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council's granting of independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence.
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West believes that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina says it is ready to unilaterally proclaim it if the Security Council does not decide in its favor.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," President Fatmir Sejdiu of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority said in the hotel in Baden, where the "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomous plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations."
“The domino effect”
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise is still feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade says it fears a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the 1990s independence wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
"The European Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.”
To reporters, Fatmir Sedjiu responded that "the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be made "in consultation" with the West.
Bush breaks deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of his international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians have finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations to find a definitive settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations in view of the “roadmap” for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty resolving all questions pending, without exception, including the central issues.”
This designation covers the three spinal issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations should be "global and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others."
In his speech, Olmert vowed that the talks would be "direct and continuous" and made "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set a deadline for the implementation of his “vision of two states” between Israel and the Palestinians.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi daily.
The prosecutors are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this kind of diverse fact, official versions and rumors oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspection of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in the intervention but in a patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare," a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “not homologated, therefore not allowed to drive on the public road” (read below) and driven by two youths without helmets, was driving “very vividly”.
"She struck the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right," a police officer said.
Alcohol controls on the occupants of the vehicle were negative.
The condition of the car (previously broken, stared windshield, ripped windshield) indicates the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary murder and non-assistance to anyone in danger" to the IGPN, co-operating with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this point, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a sort of scratch, probably caused by the friction of the pedals on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained trapped as long as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have quickly left the place, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious misconduct” regarding this point.
"This is an aspect of the more difficult investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we need to be very careful," a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows facing the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them," the witness said.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely hagard police officer, who was knocking.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the youths, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived “about 20 minutes after the police departed.”
They also performed heart massages in vain.
“I will not say that the police did not provide assistance to the youth.
These young people were rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistan's police on Monday suppressed the first protests since the state of emergency was declared two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers who were protesting against the measures taken as part of the state of emergency were wounded by the tear grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
They responded with stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police charged and wounded lawyers.
Several were questioned.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests werely held in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement gathered support from religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance on Monday, whose president “exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who voted against the state of emergency and damages to those who swore to Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise is no longer true"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure declared on Saturday night.
She was due to decide in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the presidential election on October 6 by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "is no longer true" after the state of emergency was established, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf has been placed in residence detention by his deputy army chief.
More than one-third of pregnancies are unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not planned, according to a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the INED estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has allowed a better “control of fertility,” according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has fallen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births are well planned.
Or even calculated close to the month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, the season considered to be the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repairs at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members at the International Space Station (ISS) spent more than seven hours working in space to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools "bricolated" by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical part that would soon host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of appendix for laboratory modules.
They must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power generation module, already on the ISS, to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began deploying the module’s solar panels, which have a range of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged over a meter by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who originally had to make a check-out of the Discovery shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the back of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resilient, very skillful, he has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was therefore assigned to “operate” the “injured” solar panel.
After carefully inspecting the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and installed kinds of “attels” on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the shuttle and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “bricked” by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS securities sanctioned on the stock exchange
EADS stock is currently falling sharply at the Paris stock exchange, after the aviation and defense group announced it would have to spend between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% at 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating outcome forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow progression of the engine development of the A400M, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft sound, announced in October, is between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus, said the parent company of the European aircraft manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further quantified precisions.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS’ operating profit fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned for a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The Status Quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the outcome of the polls: Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addressed the voters a television message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not leave anything clear when he received foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference – his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want the most honest, transparent and open elections, elections without addiction,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
It is a campaign under pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov said that “there have never been such dirty elections, even at the time of Yeltsin.”
Following the suppression of protests last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Homo sovieticus"
Behind these unsuspecting legislatives stand two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Vladimir Putin, who was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, could not run for a third term in a row.
No successor emerged.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In both presidential and legislative elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
“The Russians haveined the mentality of the Homo sovieticus, they do not feel master of their fate,” said Lev Goudkov, a sociologist and director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society has lagged in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin has resumed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease,” said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “voluntarily renounce personal responsibility” which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
“What good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In that name, the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
The conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: “What’s worth thinking about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are open access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only accessible for a “humanitarian” purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or its rightful successors.
The eleven states in charge of their management – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
With the process of ratification of this agreement by all states completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of the forced workers," said Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, opposed the publication of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or Gestapo arrest warrants had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labor and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU and India are hoping to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers gave their green light last April to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s ninth trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact would greatly boost both economies” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and "ten billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential". The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England offers £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 as a five-week open market transaction," it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time the BoE seems to be putting five-week liquidity on the market in an open market transaction.
This is usually done in a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "is ready to take further measures to maintain rates" of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis with its base rate.
The interbank rate per day was on Wednesday at 5,829%.
The three-month rate reached 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts marketed by the Bank of England were accompanied by a high penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favorable rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss articles in the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text rejected a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS's national office, including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the management of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was lifted at the end of the general discussion that gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s television intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his group will represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill to be examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival begins
Following numerous rumors about C3 Presents’ creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn’s Festival Republic.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the bar of the Reading Festival in the UK, which annually attracts about 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as our marketplace and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park, Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban environments.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a field festival, while ours are rather held in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both a landscape festival impression to the European and urban to the American.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports holding this event,” said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says “they are interesting enough to allow us to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life.”
Charlie Jones says the festival’s hosting capacity is “very large,” similar to that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going to the press.
“Vineland will be rock-like, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
Its C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract the Hollywood movie set in Montreal when no one but Terminator is opposed to it.
This task of seduction is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate – “politically difficult” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the “runaway productions.”
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the “Governor”?
“We have to be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he said.
Race to festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte’s priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscars race has started.
It will be all the festivals on the West Side, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors make interviews.
Dark Age had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be featured at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a end-of-year rally in the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year, experts are not as sure how this will happen.
Banif believes that “Statistically speaking, December on the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are looking at the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not supporters for the stock market to gain momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts note that “the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of leaking to quality values both in the long periods and in the short periods”.
For this, they believe that the stock market will behave rather laterally, not exempt from volatility “mainly because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in the Fed’s rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions.”
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
“That’s not the best thing,” the expert said.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost 4 percent since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional contributions to retirement plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution Day (6 December).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to the technical levels and “therefore we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked based on the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.”
Analysts expect this to be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Intermoney’s Solana says “This year the great values are back for him.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, says the increase will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they do.
“ACS has been regaining positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, December has been a falling month only twice.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technology bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will have to be seen if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (at the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to compute on its end-of-year rally.
The People's Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The National Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total there are 200 banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:00, and to open on Saturdays from 10:00 to 20:00.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other bodies to join or not to this initiative that coincides with trade hours.
This is precisely what the Bank of England is seeking.
Attract self-employed customers who move in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located across Spain in about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of the already existing ones.
For this purpose, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers in the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
Commercial head of the bank, Ángel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of personnel, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group
The People’s Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of the Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and with apparent success, according to Rivero.
The Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very large hours, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
For now, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We have arrived there.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, a delegate adviser to Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs was doubling the value of his rival, Antena 3.
There was only one aspect of his joy: ‘What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more, but that we have fallen less,’ he said.
However, he emphasized the fact that on a low market, ‘we have fallen less’.
Telecinco ended the day with a growth of 2.5%.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52 percent of the capital) and announced by Vocento (up 13 percent) thus reached €4.488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which ceded 1.52% yesterday and which accumulates a decrease of 40,5% since January, costs half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed on the stock exchange is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year's first TV channel to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order for this announced figure to be true, the TV channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in its advertising bills for the current fiscal year from 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net billing of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (to reach 734.4 million), while the net revenue of television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for Telecinco’s relative best development on the stock market is the significant pay out it hasined so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is too early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
“We have the official compromise to give at least 50 percent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its Telecinco earnings estimate to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in expected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company lowered Antenne 3’s earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
Three opinions

Ibersecurities recommends buying both securities primarily based on its high dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.
2nd
The Caja Madrid sees better Telecinco (accumulate) than Antenna 3 (continue) for the 'multiple attractions' and the rise of business.
Three
JPMorgan: it recommends considering both cases as it has had 'similar threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the MIFID, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress vote on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by MEPs and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation suitable to guarantee investor protection and to regulate the activities of agencies in detail so that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, at the time it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial consultancy services to be provided to both specialized social purposes and to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (FIAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets the multilateral trading systems and orders internationalization systems, which face competition with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and obliges them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that highlights that the securitised debt will be considered a “complex” financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which proved itself with what happened to the U.S. high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
Furthermore, they benefited from the transposition of the management benefited to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after that in 1977, the royal decree that delimites the professional functions reserved for economists was approved.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of product marketing and attracting new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonised Consumer Price Index increases by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance of the price development in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and in quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as that used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various methods of statistical modeling to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed next December 14.
“IPC will continue at relatively high levels”
The second vice president and economy minister, Pedro Solbes, said the 4.1% increase in the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there were fewer surprises" than during the previous month, when the government was not facing such a high increase.
“We expected a figure around 4 percent,” the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to raise $42 billion from Northern Rock over three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have dropped to more than 50 percent to £12 billion since it fell into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time it was accumulating some record deposits above £25,000 million, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the agency with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenue of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining 18,000 million pounds to reach the 30,000 million target.
Magnat group Richard Branson, known for its scream advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (approximately €70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of Virgin’s association, which includes three other companies, including its favourite to save it from bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) due to his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
Additionally, one of the city council secretaries and the head of the municipal police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May's I Juan Morales, the current right-wing MP, and until then municipal counselor of the town hall, and who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'manager' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council and the possibility of further arrests in the coming hours is not ruled out.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Channel indicated yesterday to the lawyer of the MP Juan Morales, he was arrested as he left Morales' home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
Moreover, according to sources in the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to recalibrate 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist party's candidacy for Toledo and to chair Congress if they win the election
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the Government President and Socialist Secretary-General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to be at the top of the Spanish Socialist Party's list for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be president of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced by the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the party’s federal headquarters with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the Manche politician will be the candidate of the Socialist group that will chair Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he return to the political avant-garde since he left him two years ago.
Moreover, he noted that even though citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the election, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into “a house of respect and not of insult or scream” and make “it look more and more like citizens”.
"Sometimes it appears unfortunately that the only local in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and quietly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate in some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how to do" and he did not want to pretend he was already in his position to not fall, as he noted, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement has subjected to ruthless persecution both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government contributed in a decisive way to bringing Spain to the forefront of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in what sectors it occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures he is going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will cause.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
There was and will be no explanation.
Just because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for companies and individuals’ accounts.
Up to a hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to Zapatero so dangerous that he rushed to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing but propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as this is only limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and which does not pretend that we move on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the range.
Totana Mayor and local police chief arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian locality of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the mayor's secretary and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, sources in the investigation said today.
The municipal counselor was arrested at his home and was taken to the town hall, where at this time many agents gathered, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Council of Urbanism and the municipal enterprise of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six arrests made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the re-qualification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing, after paying illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana instructed.
The first six detainees are now in court.
According to the sources, the former city councilor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentary of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal counselor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, the agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the bribery was carried out.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose agents, in addition to the arrests, conducted eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, who could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcia municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been refurbished and its project would include doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo’s parking lots in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary appearing in Finland's most important newspaper (certainly at the top of PISA news above educational level in the world), the Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course has caught public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor’s student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that professors adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat and he stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.”

A colleague passes the information on the introduction to the Criminal Code of Crimes on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by a sentence of six months to one year.
In contrast, theft in a store of CDs for a value of less than 400 euros, is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (a article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in CD traffic.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and CD trafficking would involve a sentence of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films without authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real then someone is exaggerating.

My attending doctor told me of one of his strange research articles titled, ‘Money produces brain activation, especially if others get less.’
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly salary of employees depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group in charge of neurocognitive imaging at the Life & Brain Institute, Germany, “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that when both people guessed they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion requires so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main responsible for the Srebrenica assassination – in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed – former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are on this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'The List of Carla' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor of Belgrade in New York who pursues criminals in flight and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
Which insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver against possible accidents, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, the age of the driver’s license, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car is even more difficult than choosing the right car.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the awarded premium and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in case of disaster.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established by taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, the age of the driving license, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the odds to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of accidents due to their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies take into account when determining the premium price.
This is why the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will here expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when signing an affordable insurance contract, such as low driving experience and the age of the driving license.
While the ideal thing to be well insured is a full-risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most foreseeable drivers can opt for an all-risk insurance with freedom, so that they get the coverage of an all-risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays a part of the damage amount.
"The portion of the amount of damages that the customer pays will be established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount will be," specifies Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europa, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damages caused to third parties, but by for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
and a counsel.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be careful and avoid damages as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the base rate.
“Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses, "clarifies Noguera.
After the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers when signing an insurance contract, as the rate of accidents is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
That is why it is best to choose an insurance with all risk frankly.
“Normally, young people cannot take advantage of the experience acquired in advance after an accident,” the director of the European car company in Spain assures, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the novice’ has passed.
However, if the customer is married but does not yet have children it is best that he negotiates insurance at all risks, as long as his economic situation allows him to do so.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest rate of damages, because the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with franchise (which can be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of the vehicle’s life when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more casual drive and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises," Luis Noguera judges.
For retirees an all-risk insurance with franchise is preferable (this being the one of 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to get to the eighth-finals
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will meet next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and they have already qualified in the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not go ahead of him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan is due to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on December 13 in search of a place for the December 16 final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most anticipated outcome, although both teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would stay first and ensure a better cross in the eighth finals.
A defeat of the Gordon Strachan team could be enough to qualify if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to compute only on this since with nine points the game comes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth-finals for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the prolongations (1-0).
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth-finals to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that the Benfica, although last and without chances of continuing European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend Spice Girls' first concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
‘Posh Spice’ (Victoria Beckham), ‘Scary Spice’ (Melanie Brown), ‘Baby Spice’ (Emma Bunton), ‘Sporty Spice’ (Melanie Chisholm) and ‘Ginger Spice’ (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver’s GM Place Stadium that the group’s meeting is ‘brilliant’.
Around 20,000 people exhausted their tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that made rage in the late 1990s.
The encounter and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that retraces their main hits as well as two new songs, ‘Headlines’ and ‘Voodoo’, which EMI releases in Spain.
The five Spice Girls members came on stage showing the bracelets that the spouse of 'Posh Spice' had given them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience filling the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he'll think of the show."
Sporty Spice, who joined the band in 1998 "due to differences between us" and which caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
“I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people’s feelings have changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls have changed.
And I thought why not, I’m glad I made a decision,” Chisholm said at the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate each other a lot."
But a lot has changed since the last time the Spice Girls showed in 1998.
First, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby sitter army was waiting for them.
She has five of seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4), and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
It will be exhibited in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine throws the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas is heating up between Ukraine and Russia, thereby increasing the risks of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are carried by pipelines, and each pipeline is closely monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase the transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned monopoly gas supplier, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would result in a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, reminding us that we are a country through which most gas is transited," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom’s supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a decline in exports to Western Europe, resulting in rising prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s gas supplies.
Russia has the largest gas reserves, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other countries of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health “must control its foreign employees.”
The Scottish Ministry of Health should improve checks to be carried out on its non-community employees to check whether they have previous penalties, the control committee said.
The warning from General Auditor Robert Black came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the June bombing at Glasgow airport.
Mr Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no precise data on the number of overseas people he employs.
His report, however, highlighted other decisive checks, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The general revisor has carried out checks on non-community staff following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi descent at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after drowning his jeep into the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October as suspected of being involved in various car explosions attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to conduct pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experience, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health use Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks of previous penalties, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of the UK.
Among the many warnings, the General Reviewer’s report now states that committees are required to confront the Bureau of Control of previous penalties, thus allowing employers to undertake checks across different countries.
"While we have found that some staff information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report said.
Mr. Black said the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he also added: “Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information about certain members of overseas staff is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said “the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently performed work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value.”
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the general revisor stressed that these figures must be revised upwards, partly due to problems with identifying staff members with indefinite contracts, who could choose to stay in our country or not.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures of health authority controls in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passport, work permit and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment controls for Overseas Health Service staff members.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.”
She added that the Scottish government, allied with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be released next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, which are valid for all employees, including overseas people.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio peak on the latest Joy Division singer, Ian Curts, won 5 awards, including Best Film, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was hired in the role of Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Judi Dench was named Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be under the international mirrors.
The prizes were presented at the London Round House.
Control tells the story of Curtis's rise to the success of Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black-and-white film, whose music was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was filmed with a budget of just 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2’s album Joshua Tree, won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best beginner director.
He also won the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor Award was awarded to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his coriac character acts, won the Richard Harris Prize for his remarkable contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has made films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honour of star Harris, the protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema,” he said.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admiring this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The Independent Film Oscars, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury composed of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrorist plots
Saudi Arabia has revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells manipulating an imminent attack on a oil site, as well as attacks on ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smugglers cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have been running a campaign against the U.S. monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on a oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly set up a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006 on the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement from the interior minister, said 18 of the people arrested belonged to a cell headed by a “missile launcher expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned the counterband of eight missiles in the kingdom.
Twenty-two people among the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The government has urged the ecclesiastics to do more against the Saudi-led in Iraq, to join al-Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and the allied Shia Muslim government in the United States, considered heretical by the Sunny Saudi hardline.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the royal family’s policy that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-West Saudi government by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of al-Qaeda, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and power supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months,” the interior minister’s spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized into a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thought,” the ideology of Sunni radical Muslims that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit showed that the planet is twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are virtually the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation coupled with a slower rotation led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is devastated by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Oxford University physics professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why Venus’s climate is so different from Earth’s, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium was seized by the police.
One kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people have been arrested and that the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was actually uranium, but revealed that the goods would be worth $1 million (£480,000).
Open to everything again
Mitt Romney has said he is not up to the height as a presidential candidate, to answer a snowman’s questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters, having registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions raised were as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected much of the conditions of the Republican party, candidate in the upcoming elections.
It is unclear on what criteria the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest addressing a single topic, focused on immigration.
This is one of the topics for Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to call when they hear jokes: The government has recorded increases in approval when candidates spoke roughly.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the National Front, and Romney, who is at the forefront of the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote an “amnesty” (offering clandestines regular status and the opportunity to become citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to go deeper into this topic.
None of them have the chance to be elected, but both remain in the race, because they started fighting immigration earlier and more sharply than others.
In general, the candidates, at least as far as immigration is concerned, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, coupled with concerns about toxic toys made in China in particular, or other fears about the outside world, encourage Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between Liberal and Catholic Conservatives.
But the debate became embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the weapons control campaign.
John McCain and Romney have debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed the entire content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe the story of Jonas and the Whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee, – in pole position in Iowa at a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – would declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When they insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to run for the election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s rise to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious subsidy searches conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and whispers during Wednesday’s debate.
These two are emerging from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two defenders of the party are unable to agree on deciding which candidate is the most well-known and more traditionalist.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly through a successful message about American greatness bringing leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The Pain of Workers
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole to sink into; Even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this is not juicy.
No decorations sold, no Paris hotel bills of politicians, no extra marital footprint sucked.
But now a revelation testifies that a wealthy businessman had hidden for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the prime minister stepped back in his election plan, stupidly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, stated that the terrifying Mr. Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The acquisition of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble on the brink of the crack, has demonstrated a breach of guidelines and a mediocre judgment in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals in favour of the tax code change provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against military spending cuts: they proclaimed that being defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
Currently, the suspicion of foolish donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary general (and his former chief of vigilance) have forced them to resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards the exit.
However, governments can come to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and don’t trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers make the balance sheet; the press searches for bad stories; and the government becomes on the defensive and without any objectives anymore.
In a sense, Mr. Brown’s position is difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his upper lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown’s decisions when he was chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party’s funds of “cash money for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown’s difficult situation is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as members of the Tories Party make it think.
As in Mr. Bean, there is no victim or scam.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to concrete Mr. Brown’s ever-stalinistic tendencies, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special figure, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of the big donors of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams’s programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising officer who spoke of dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative gap, but he did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power rests on a trick he knows well, resorting to an investigative committee on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
If the law is violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Public Life Standards Committee, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good financial reform on political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to give up its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some supportive facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to regain voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Fraud with cards.
Will the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s normal to see swimmers swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card-related losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credit, partly due to the weakness of card holders.
It is still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody's, a tax agency, the third quarter's insolvency rate of 3.89 percent is almost a point lower than its historical average.
The decline in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in 2005 in the United States regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and thus insolvency rates) could rise even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market exist: consumers might prefer to raise their debts now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow than to the value of the asset, and therefore the fall in property prices has not necessarily resulted in a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even provide benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer bonuses for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority for repaying the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgage lenders and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of having a rapid recovery of stocks.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, CEO of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there are strong risks of having a significant drop.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market drive America into recession, the industry will surely have to face a macabre future.
Be careful with the dorsal swimmers.
British banks claim guilty of Enron.
The three British bankers who were due to testify to their roles in a fraud committed by former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of seven charges of alleged conspiracy fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to get rich despite their employees.
They are due to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all declared themselves guilty of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous across Britain due to the extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a question pending for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges placed against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of government investigation into Enron’s collapse.
The accusations against the bankers, nicknamed the “Natwest’s Three,” say they came to Houston in 2000 to organize a fraudulent script with Fastow and his former right-wing, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the cast of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him trick bankruptcy procedures.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought bank interest from the subsidiary for £1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest on this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in reality, those $20 million went to the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron crash.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow was sentenced to six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after paying a bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the nation's seventh largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its dumb speculations as profitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion in loss of market value and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company’s collapse.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were futile because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Neither under nor outside of Moscow.
The cost of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and possessing a fuel range sufficient to fly without a stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs so many seats as it’s more of a family-use plane or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at Gulfstream’s stand last Friday at the Millionaire’s Show, a four-day consumer incentive orgia held in a huge exhibition center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of newly wealthy Russians in their varied products, ranging from acajou yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.
“Thanks to a oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, like Dallas”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar at the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH president, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for selling luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Additionally, two-thirds of the wealthy are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweller.
She attended the exhibition for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking through the salon on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, declare to be like their clients, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Melle Yumatova, who grabbed her high-coat dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show appears to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to catch the queue in the locks to come to an immense warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum cushions, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund bears are exhibited.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch porcelain factory stand in Delf, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles.
Russians are more interested in bling bling.
Indeed, sellers have stated here that Russian owners of old capital (10 to 15 years are too old according to Russian standards) have already moved from glossy logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists, see the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses embedded in gold thread.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last-cry alarm systems, also said he sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of oysters' leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tyres," Karapetian said.
He will definitely keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rising property prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more than you could think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company has erected four stands representing the UK telephone cabins, filled with mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Passengers stopped to throw bills, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile phones, in the midst of this false wealth or earning a few millions.
“You see, here in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Non-Authorized Surgeon Suspected of Murder in New Jersey
It was on the eve of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was staring through the glass bay of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and observing an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said on Wednesday.
It was then that I realized that someone had died.
Authorities later learned that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, an assistant director of the Newark police department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death was due to a gesture performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, whom police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they are confidently waiting for the results of toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but which should allow to solve this mysterious death that saddened the top ranks of Newark police.
Melle Arroyo has been the assistant of police chief Garry F. Mc Carthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and stubborn,” Mr. McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
“He was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drink Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor’s Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo died due to an unauthorized surgery.
“This is a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said she had arrived at home around 3 p.m.
And I found Melle arroyo on the couch.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh was unable to confirm whether Melle Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out whether a part of the house was used as a medical cabinet.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of the house of Melle Castro where a faint rosary rests in the narrow cemetery in front of it, and a Dalmatian whispered in the back.
A blue bowl called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a replacement for vanilla in cooking and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two bicycles hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to be careful about this,’” he said.
She was there when I arrived and there when I left.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates linked to the global stock market efervescent.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to soothe credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the reassuring statements of the U.S. central bank’s vice president.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that those who make decisions must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in the turbulent financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure markets that are irritable over these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence has in part “inverted some improvements in market operation at the end of September and October.
In the event that this tough turbulence would persist, it would increase the probability of further rigid financial conditions for owners and, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the U.S. markets, and that further reductions in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the U.S. economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for October.
The repercussions of this financial upheaval were accentuated following the statement of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will dismiss 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce fees to compensate for heavy losses due to losing stakes on real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 331 points, 2.55% to 13.289,40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Previously, the recurrence of credit difficulties in the markets has been highlighted following the high demand for a monthly auction of funds issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London’s financial markets, causing credit tensions, have caused the monthly “Libor” borrowing rates of British banks to cause their highest growth since last September, at 6.59 percent following a sharp rise since November 12.
England is facing a appeal against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And more importantly, in such a broad context as the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the selection chairman who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris’ office, England’s Chief Executive Officer, is beginning to fill out application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
Anyone who fails to win the No. 6 backgammon will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is too.
It is never easy to destroy what allows one man to reach the top of his profession, while another will never reach the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is this right for Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee “tubby”? both, new executives having obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless they are given at least one chance?
The numbers have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must capture the captain’s eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer of a day.
But capturing the selectors’ eyes is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed sure to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class goals in 33 rounds to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on the same average, but both have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to still offer.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya stadium is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but that makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful spins, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and this despite the fact that his double hundred scoring against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will surely follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah’s greater experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88 Test innings in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 years is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently capped himself on a 4x4 during a presentation of Volkswagen, England’s sponsor.
He only postponed slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from a distance, to ask him “Did he see this?”
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his flying appearance allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beat with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Is this the true art of selection?
I would be favourable to give Bopara a chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be he who will play this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and to fight Al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping those exiles without money or visa renewal, or others who still hope that the city will return to normality.
Some came back to fight the militants who drove them away from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival from Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
"They say that the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned home with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aided militia helped to drive Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him to come home.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad due to a grenade attack after he prompted citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
He had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m going home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the capital’s growing calm since U.S. troops arrived, and the sight of continued training of well-armed “groups of citizens involved” and collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion felt by everyone about exile visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Shia Prime Minister, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country because of the sectarian squadrons of death.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” said the Sunni retired.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence can be explained in part by the fact that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will increase sectarian tensions again and bring back fighting.
Small and good training.
The smallest federal state leads in professional training, and even shines out by the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
“I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarois, that we are not French” – this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-desire, poses for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre formation system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighboring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there by a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
Sarre also takes the country’s children to higher schools in more than average numbers – many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
“In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system,” says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
Also, the possibilities of combining professional and academic training are relatively well developed.
In terms of the number of inhabitants, the double-cursus panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Sarrois Ministry of Education has forced higher schools to conduct a marketing campaign in the engineering science subjects.
“After the first PISA studies, we have celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is exempt – a model that other federal states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether student performance is improving sustainably.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And despite the large number of Sarrois, foreign language skills are not measured by PISA studies – otherwise you could earn points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even though the Sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets the clock.
In Venezuela, watches will soon do tic-tac differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chavez will reverse the timepiece by half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez has become a caricature in Spain.
As the official Venezuelan newspaper, due to a new law, watches will be set to less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
On Wednesday, Chávez announced the cessation of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have any relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, already just because of my dignity," Chávez said as he hurried a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger of this dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw from Chavez the mandate to negotiate on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe had "cracked the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is also in every mouth.
A new cell phone ringing is furious in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you keep quiet) is the phrase that has already been downloaded on the internet by more than half a million people.
It was pronounced by King Juan Carlos of Spain who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant interpellations of leftist populists and told him to keep silent.
Germany was threatened by a fall in wages in 2007.
Despite the strong economy, according to a forecast, a real underworth of wages threatens German workers this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their salary in 2007 compared to the previous year.
“The fault lies in low wage growth, the increase in value added tax and rising food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncture Research told Bild.
New charges could also be imposed on unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency is no longer entitled to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, the explosion in food and petroleum prices pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is the Infernal Twin of Earth.
Despite its life-hostile atmosphere, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turns at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today proved this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus burst at an altitude of about 56 kilometers of cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life has existed, it must have been at a very ancient date in history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be little living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be Earth’s infernal twin, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important milestone in Venus's search, as no more spacecraft had been on its way for the exploration of this planet since the 1980s.
According to the researchers, the most recent results of research that have now been presented in several articles in "Nature" not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the points in common with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than initially assumed.
Thus, the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbulence already known at the north pole, a turbulence of clouds at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon resembles air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet, called the evening or morning star, orbits the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower on itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bars, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed in similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost into space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the dispute between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor’s office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about Germany's appearance and summons the large coalition to close the quarrel about welcoming the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the welcoming of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and was attacked for this outside the CDU ranks.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, of the CDU’s “front-end policy” in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritation was felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel reports, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive Tibetan spiritual leader in his official duties, Wen Jiabao supported the Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, shootings, car fires: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets by violence, the German interior minister called for.
Barricades burning, thieves firing at police with hunting guns: after the severe youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must make sure that a social explosive does not also form within us and disappears into violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he told the “Neue Presse” in Hannover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, federal states and municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
It is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this already shows its first successes.”
However, it would be too early to end the warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems, nor from the point of view of urban planning, as in France.
In the northern Paris agglomerations, young people had engaged in severe street battles with police over the past nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings also burned.
Greater integration efforts from the German government, this is what the President of Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would not be as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigration would be higher than average.
First of all, more places should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted: “We must give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish Communities, however, added that social control in the families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged, “But we must still be careful.”
It should be prompt to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training.”
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with projectors.
Authorities have three arrests, as well as several burned cars and garbage bags.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1,000 security forces has guaranteed calm.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
In the night of Tuesday, 80 police officers were wounded in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the riots overcame in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
The Empire of Angela Merkel.
The Chancellor’s utopian entrance shows that the coalition has ended – and that there is nothing to expect from her.
In which country does the Chancellor live?
After her disappointing intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be ruled by it.
The accusation of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a tough and presumptuous phrase.
It’s provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this reproach was.
There was neither concrete interest nor feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in a heavyweight, fleeing foreign policy and still remaining in the nearby.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, she welcomes the Heiligendam agreements over and over again, but does not say how climate targets should be achieved in our country.
Even self-promotion - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it even two years ago.
Now she clamps herself to all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
Thus it destroys its image of a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and worries of low-wage workers?
There are a few adverse phrases for this.
In this matter, it is revealing how many times it makes lapsus when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three beginnings to pronounce a semi-accurate sentence.
It sits on unknown ground, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney engage in a tough offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The candidates’ tensions are already breaking out on the first issue.
He would have made New York a "refuge for clandestines," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say his own home was a haven for clandestines,” Giuliani replied, blaming the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates rise to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favourites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users uploaded via YouTube are hardly more than blasts.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to come to power," McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also vigorously taught by Vietnamese veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the campaign’s major themes go beyond the Iraq war and the torture debate can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are rejected, applause flows through the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites are revealed.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney said, apologizing to the base and the television audience for still being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, goes into a flowing node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as army chief, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was invested as president.
Eight years of military rule ended.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was appointed on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as the head of a civil state.
With this withdrawal from the position of chief commander of the armed forces, Musharraf had met the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had declared on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf held after the state of emergency was established with lawyers from its ranks, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock are back.
The German supergroups of the 1970s rejoice: the three members of the group Harmonia again took their console at a concert in Berlin.
For their return appeared recordings of their great hit "Live 1974".
At that time, they were well known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has a small box in front of them, their cable and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, reigns in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old with a laptop and a guitar.
To the right, observed by the whole auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes this is added inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the men themselves.
The fact that the group Harmonia played again secured some emotion among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reasoned in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always liked more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop face interrogators were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyrical praise, the surprise had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped onto the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and that during this period, the power of impact that was felt was much weaker than what was attributed to it later by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We play first in the basements below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly defeated Kraftwerk and had eventually made a name as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an old Weser farm, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Common I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Instead, an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
It was said that there was in the trash a fanion of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for art.
Many keep Harmony away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
For as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood did not serve in itself.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of 50 heads, as someone thinks to remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esoterism and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
Gressem’s Live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Grönland label set the goal ofining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been uncovered on this occasion as Roedelius’ personal work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Subsidized publicly, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be marked with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase floats in the room amidst the singular sounds: “The only true music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black-and-white photographs of basar cable tools serve to form the legend.
The three veterans are once again improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the battery, to draw unheard sounds to instruments thanks to self-built instruments with effects.
Electronic music is similar to electronic music.
All three are great technicians.
Even the home of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never rock.
The roots have been less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who cries "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also no longer lets herself be irritated by it.
But what is most obvious will be covered thoroughly on the stage.
Where does music begin and end?
This can tap on someone’s nerves (?) or give fugitive moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killer Peace", two films once again address the Balkan War.
Both are not convincing.
Either the projects rely too much on action and senseless exchanges of shots or, on the contrary, they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely there, in the hideousest backdrop of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many gentle and futile roles in women’s feelings films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism raised his desire to show up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch yet "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's movies have to be as long and confusing as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
It delivers a magnificent representation filled with blinking eyes: at the bottom, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and film industry were not as benevolent: a man who has his best moments long behind, but who, even as a ruined monument to its decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Killer Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless sequel of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film tells the story of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovo shooters, in which one of them falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost too quickly in action and senseless exchanges of shots.
It remains a kind of “Alarm for Cobra 11” without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the bottom there has never been a really good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track the high war criminal “the fox,” might have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at the same time Richard Shepard), at another time a new “Apocalypse Now”.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in a small team into the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do, and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute a romantic adventure with a Bosnian woman who was later assassinated.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, achieves what NATO, the CIA and all the prize hunters in the world have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so bad that it should be brought to the International Court of Justice of The Hague for crimes against film logic.
In this case, the film has a too deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) that they do not conduct the hunt intensely enough because of secret political agreements.
But the good intention and the evil are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
The one speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionate, I see the veins on the forehead swollen, clearly: how tired it is to be evil."
Movies like “The Hunting Party” have exactly such tumescent heads, but that hint how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently it was in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
It can be added: there have never been good films about South Africa.
What is true every time: when a star drags onto a crisis focal point or on a mine field, it then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have still passed before Hollywood could shoot a good Holocaust film with “The Schindler List.”
Some films still have to mature - those that today are worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But today we also know too much about the conflicts of the world, where every helicopter comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that delights the writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Dictator" have actually become as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
You may not want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Per we should have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel “Lemprière’s Dictionary” and the Balkan War, he replied: “It’s only because certain things never change.”
“Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in horrific ways, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust raises criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor’s retreat from Hamburg’s candidacy for the Summer Olympics has faced fierce criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the water.
But von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
Hamburg Chamber of Commerce chief Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz described the move as "bad for the local economy."
In recent times, no other project has deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this goal, the political and sports momentum could not have beenined in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point for it in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
“It is not Hamburg that decides about an Olympic candidacy, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports,” Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, regarding Munich’s candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that in the time frame we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance."
However, dreams don’t definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg would no longer be applying for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to shut down an opportunity, buriing the projects now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would further contradict the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, von Beust would have called Hamburg’s candidacy for the 2015 Universiades “not a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first in recent weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor’s SPD faction blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Petit Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic card and excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have bet exclusively on the "event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg, for its part, would have aroused great enthusiasm.
Hamburg had lost to Leipzig.
These are not Warhol’s boxes.
Whoever connects the concept of Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Right now, wooden boxes made in Sweden throw shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
Much of the eighty-ten Brillo-Boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today results in a disappointing result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as much of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first “Brillo-Boxes”, painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the powdered soap cartons “Brillo”.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 – with the agreement of Warhol – hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not about artworks here, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses from the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered right into the history of art and auctions, as Andy Warhol's original Brillo-Boxes licensed, with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have ceded to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservative at the Moderna Museet, examined, besides the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other private Swedish collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their layered panels were first printed and pinched, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies dating back to the 1990s, on the contrary, reveals that the paint was directly applied without a layer of background on the layered panels, using a paint roll - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
“These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Brillo-Box list,” says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: “If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York doesn’t make another decision, Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material.”
Already in July the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
Since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
The rebel troops of Manila
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers are giving up, the same ones who had stuck in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
Soldiers who were loyal to the government had assaulted the hotel with tear gas.
Two dozen soldiers had been stuck in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclips with about 30 supporters.
The military policemen, who normally had to watch them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his riot.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Troops loyal to power closed the sector around the respectable hotel.
He called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People are tired of it,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commanded the elite unit of the Scouts Rangers, said other units in the army would soon want to join the march.

United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.5% of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a purchase.
The option would remain open to further increase the participation in Versatel.

Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the bank Berenberg increased its stake in the network operator of Düsseldorf from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, it is told on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million.
United Internet bought it for 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a spokesman for United Internet.
Both companies founded the MSP joint-venture company in order to absorb competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not to make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet Thursday.
Both companies, however, would leave all options open, especially to increase their participation in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The still hardly predictable poker on Freenet that lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillisch Holding held a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent extra.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of investment firm Vatas had already been decided in August.
