A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a shortage of funds to improve the demolished highway system, many people are looking for its solution in small black boxes, which fit the cleaning on your car’s dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by motorists and communicates that information to authorities, has become the subject of a controversial effort by Washington and the State Planning Office to overthrow an outdated system to finance major U.S. roads today.
Usually, boring work like highway planning has also suddenly become a matter of intense debate and lively alliances.
You have met with Liberal Environmental groups in favour of holding details of the miles driven by, and possibly the locations driven - and then using this information to prepare tax bills - to raise support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The Tea Party.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising various types of privacy issues.
While Congress does not agree on whether to act further or not, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how in the next decade they can go into a system in which drivers pay for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is truly an indispensable object for our country.
"It's not a matter of being chosen by us or not," says Hassan Ikarata, who is the executive director of the Southern California Government Federation, which is planning to start tracking every mile determined by motorists in California by the year 2025.
There will be changes in the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country’s Highway Trust Fund has almost failed, which is financed by paying taxes on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
Americans no longer buy as much gas as before.
Now a gallon of gas car runs more miles than before.
The federal tax has not increased in the past 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians refrain from even raising a penny in taxes.
Transport policy expert Lee Munich at the University of Minnesota says, “Gas tax is absolutely not transferable.”
Their state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, “In the near future, it will act as the most logical option.”
Winx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It’s not surprising that this idea seems good to urban liberals, as it could change taxes to change the way cars drive, for example, which could help reduce emissions and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are curious about this system as they are developing strategies to meet the goals set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transportation Committee, Rip Bill Schuster (AA), also considers the black box the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers at the Regen Foundation are also in favor of paying per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, deputy chairman of the policy in Regen, said, “It’s not just doing what’s going to the blind pit.”
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries, who in their 2011 report graciously advanced towards a per-mile payment from Congress.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million test project last year involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural method-makers, who were representing individuals who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to the city on a daily basis, the parliamentary leadership ended that proposal.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most sought-after Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay a mileage fee instead of a gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the Eastern Cable, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support in all locations.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 volunteer car drivers just a while ago, drivers were too susceptible to thinking that the government could monitor their every move.
Al-Alouddin Khan, who directs strategic and operational management in the Nevada Transportation Department, says that “anxiety about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem.”
It’s not what people wanted.
As the testing proceeded, A.C.L.U. of Nevada warned on its website: “It will be considerably easier to convert this device into a complete tracking device.”
There is no need to develop enormous, unmanageable technology infrastructure, which inevitably had to spread to keep a record of each person’s daily arrival.
Nevada is among the many states that are making every effort to obtain affordable technology, with the help of which the state can obtain details of how many miles a car runs per day, but not where and at what time it runs.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to a small California start-up called Troy Myell.
This firm was not originally in the business of helping state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, where drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device it’s testing was good for highway planners, as it doesn’t use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a certain time interval.
True Milead’s chief executive Ryan Morrison said, “If you don’t track people’s speed and their location, they’ll be more inclined to adopt this approach.”
There have been some major mistakes in these early programmes of the state.
There are also very little costly and less interfering ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are trying to give drivers a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or again, you can choose not to take any devices, but rather choose to pay a fixed fee based on the average miles determined by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing even more convenience instead of less in the device.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop such a taxing device that will also facilitate the payment of parking meter fees, provide “pay according to your drive” insurance, and generate real-time speed data collection from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document mentions, “Motor-drivers will be attracted to participate in it because of the benefits obtained from it.”
However, some transport planners are surprised that the whole discussion on paying according to miles is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can deal with the problem of the highway trust fund very easily by increasing gas taxes.
Hybrid or other car drivers may also be charged an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their fair share.
The Commission’s Director of Constitution and Public Affairs, Randy Rentscheller, said, “What a pulmonary surgery is needed for her when it can work with aspirin.”
If we do, millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to police, his death was due to drowning.
In fact, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of hiding his baggage.
The police have submitted the final report of the death investigation to the court.
On August 26, the police recovered the body of the Vidad Iqbal living in the Paddish Garden in the sea of Zhelam.
His family accused his friends of killing him because his mobile phone and other items were missing.
In the report, the police said that the deceased’s phone and SIM were checked and found that her phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the interrogation that the phone was given to her by a relative of her, Roy Goher.
Roel also lives in the Pastoral Gardens and he was a friend of the Divine Revelation.
Roel was swallowed in the seal with the witness after the Prayer-A-Zuma on August 25.
Proud opened his clothes and put all his baggage on the edge, while Rehal went to the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, he was not there, he had only his clothes.
Roel sought the witch, but he did not find it.
He picked up his mobile phone, clock and other items and put it for his use.
He didn’t tell anyone that he had drowned.
Police told the court that the death of the victim was from drowning and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
In fact, Rouel has been detained under section 404 to hide facts and the deceased’s belongings.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, married a 28-year-old girl.
This was revealed by his family friend, Maltiel Polanko.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been prime minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francesca’s meeting with Balusconi occurred when she was a teen activist at the Forza Italia party.
This is where Francisca, whose relationship was being said to be his relationship with Baluscony, appears to be much more apparent.
Berlusconi's close friend and bullish girlfriend Martel Polanco has revealed that she was also invited to this intelligent wedding.
This ceremony took place three weeks ago.
In a statement on Italian Radio 2, when Polanco was asked what would happen if they married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public celebration.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the former prime minister’s home.
Other than that, no one can say anything.
However, she did not attend this wedding.
He sent his blessings to the new man.
The two married about three weeks ago, on 8 or 9 October.
About eight months ago, a 28-year-old woman, 50 years younger than her, was engaged to Francesca Pascal.
To avoid Kirkyri, Berlusconi had laid the foundation for solitude behind his decision.
In the lower areas also continued to rain between the eyes of the sun.
With it, the whole process has begun.
The estimate of the cold can be drawn from the same fact that the minimum temperature in Sri Lanka has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, 0.2 degrees below zero in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
It was the coldest in the whole country.
Therefore, from the strategic perspective of rain and snowfall, important Srinagar-Leh national highway traffic has been closed.

Due to the activity of the western district, the rains began in the high-rise areas of the district and lower areas of the district, which continued until late evening.
The common cold was also affected.
People fled the houses to escape.
Meanwhile, the electricity supply in many areas also stopped.

In prison for sexual assault allegations closed in आसaram on Friday once again disappointed by the Supreme Court.
In the media coverage deceived by Askaram, he is being presented as Dracula drinking the blood of children, but the court rejected his request to stop the media coverage.
The chief judge, P. Surashivam’s back, refused to order the media to stop running news about him, saying that he had seen every word in the media and that there was no reason for him to hold onto it.
How can we stop them when they are getting notifications from the police and other people?
Earlier, Askaram’s lawyer accused the media that he was showing news about them.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed a case against whom, but the back was not affected by these scammers and refused to seize the case, saying that they had more options.
Even before, the court has repeatedly called for an end to the media coverage.
Department officials claim this is the largest TDS theft case to date.
The group operator of the mall paid TDS to the relevant financial institutions, but did not pay it to the government treasury.
In this way, the TCDD’s revenue is being collected by itself.
This group came from Mumbai on 17 October and the research team joined the Jaipur research team.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the trader had cut the TDS but did not deposit.
For this reason, the TDS team started the action on this group on Thursday.
The threat of sealing the account occurred about 15 days ago on this mall operator's group of surveys and actions.
Angry at this action, the trader has made it clear to the officials of the IRS that they are not ready to pay the TDS for the IRS.
The department is carrying out operations for them.
Officials investigating this case have made it clear that the recovery action will be carried out by sealing the account in case of non-payment.
The demand for sweets is increasing.
As a result, the price of counterfeit and counterfeit goods increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweet and glossy, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration Department has shut down a campaign against fake meat and chemical sweets.
The department seized 5 thousand lights from 70 thousand Mava and Quetta Cologne from the Middle East.
With the increased demand for sweets in the market, the demand for small meat from the Middle East has also increased.
The shit-kept Mavi had the information department to bring Nagoya from the Middle East.
Transport Garage from Mavi to Nagoya.
The department took possession of this milk, which was priced at 70 thousand rubles.
The fear of action did not justify anyone.
The department destroyed it as an unacceptable (unacceptable) property.
The department imprinted about 5 thousand candlesticks on the Victoria Caterers in Quetta Cologne.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to shine and last for more than a day.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
The co-operative of the department of S.S. Country leader said that the campaign for chemical sweet and commodity and fake meat will continue.
In the next few days, this campaign and acceleration information has been provided by the department.
These sweets can also be confused.
The department told sweets businessmen to make good milk, sweets from meat.
People have been appealed from the Department of Caution to be careful of fake sweets and meals.
The 42 senior leaders elected by the BJP of the province took their strong lead on the airport.
It is remarkable that the Modi have come to the Bharat for a journey organized by the Bharat Party.
The organizing of the saintly journey is for the families of those killed in the explosions in Pattaya to be rescued from the BJP.
It is remarkable that there were a total of seven explosions in Pattaya on October 27 during Narendra Modi's Hunkar Rally.
The intention of the terrorists of the Indian Mujahideen, who were killed in the explosions, was to blast during the rally, so that more people were killed and became an atmosphere of terror in the province.
The attack did not succeed, but six people died in the explosions.
All of them were declared sheriffs.
From his village, the party leader left for a trip on Friday.
The 5th of November will be driven together to break down all of their bones.
This trip is an arrangement of the journey.
Its main characters are Narendra Modi.
They will visit the villages of people killed in the explosions from seven in the morning on Saturday to meet their families.
During this offer, they will also give the families of the dead a check of five rupees.
The announcement of this economic aid has already been made by the BJP.
The Indian team, enthusiastic about the explosive victory in the last match on Saturday when M will land in the seventh and final one-day against Australia at M Chinaswami Stadium, his goal will be to capture the series with a win.
Due to the rain, India had to win the Nagpur One Day at any time to stay in the series after two consecutive one-day matches were washed, and his ballerinas gave him a record win while performing explosively, making the team equal to 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved the goal of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility to cross the team will be on the butler.
Indian bullshit is at the extreme at this time and a bigger goal is also proving to be booming in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shimakhar, विराt Kohli and महेंद्र Singh are in tremendous form, but the team will also have some hopes from Yuvaraj Singh, सुरेश Rana and Rovani Jadeja.
As far as the question of opening is concerned, Roehit and the team as a summit have such a greeting pair that solid partnership is making the work of the rest of the fighters easier.
In Jaipur and Nanjing, he had the opportunity to play without any pressure while making a fantastic partnership in Opening.
At the third number, Kohli is now believed to be the future of the trick from what he has done so far.
Instead, many cricketers have given them even better deals than सचिon.
The next week will be 25 years old, with 17 one-day wins, of which India has won in 16.
In pursuit of the goal, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India’s top three players are in strong shape, but excessive dependency on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Rana and Juventus were badly flopped in the last match.
Juvara hasn't even opened in two matches in the series.
In such a way, Bengaluru can work for them in a good one-day "life line".
As far as the Australian question is concerned, his butlers, especially Captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with his performance.
He is also demanding to go to the test team for domestic essays against England.
Australia has a good number to nine.
In addition to Belly, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Faulkner have done a good job in the series.
However, in the opening, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch were unable to leave any impact.
The lack of Michelle Johnson in basketball could hurt Australia.
Johnson, who has so far performed brilliantly in the series, has been sent home for the preparations of the Ashes series.
The member and chief spokesman of the BJP National Committee, Dr. Jander Singh, said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists in the midst of this apparent peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued today that Pakistan is insisting on the heels to infiltrate terrorists in its training camps prepared for the year 2000.
There will never be peace on the border.
In Kashmir, people have been inflicted on a massive scale after the isolationists’ efforts to deteriorate the situation have failed.
Referring to the Pakistan tour of the separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISIS Chief Lieutenant General Jair Ul Islam, Lashkar, Hezbollah’s Sargana Hafiz Said and Said Salehudin believed that terrorism would be wiped out in 2014.
Pakistan is seriously committed to fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers on the border, samba, and suicide attacks in Hiranggar are part of this strategy.
In such circumstances, giving a deadly deal to the demand to end the privileges of the army in the state, the BJP leader said that it is also anti-general to do such things until there is lasting peace in the state.
They find out about the country’s counterparts.
He insisted that the army of the leaders, the security forces, should be stopped on memoir-falling statements.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. alert
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence officer, has announced that he is prepared to travel to Berlin to provide proof to parliament in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fail to respond about his activities.
German MP Hans Christian Strobel, who met Mr. Snowden on Monday in Russia, where he was given asylum to speak about his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented by Snowden in front of the media in Berlin on Friday, MEPs said: "Al the outcome of my efforts is demonstrably positive, my government considers disagreement as a party-changing, and does not provide any defense that is an attempt to criminalize political speech with the accusations of Gundegaard."
Speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believes that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges filed on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice include theft of secrecy and government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, German Interior Minister, told the online Zeit: “Mr. Snowden is preparing to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA claims to have hacked Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Operman, MEP who is chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence information. said that if Mr Snow Den had the opportunity to hear as a witness “without completely destroying relations with America and putting them in danger,” then it should still be taken.
Mr. Strobe Belley, a member of Germany’s Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
He was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Belene said, according to a former NSA contractor lawyer, Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany he would be “safe” there that would require assurances, MEPs said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that "he had to face a harsh and continuing campaign" for him to be forced to leave his home.
Although he said Weaver is delighted and overwhelmed by widespread responses to "his work of political expression."
Including the United States - citizens of the world as well as senior officials have appreciated the revelation of an irresponsible system of comprehensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines will charge on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for luggage carriage on store for passengers on board their aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carriage-on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although it announced on Wednesday that passengers can keep a full box.
New Carey - On-Free is for bags in overhead beans, so, small bags underneath the seat will still be free.
Frontier said that will charge $25 if advances are paid in, $100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said $100 fee is to to take care of charges in passenger advances.
“We don’t want to charge him,” he said.
The airlines started charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid passenger charges are filled as much as they can in the carry-on baggage that is stacked in the overhead box, which means that this box often has less space.
Fee is a way to bring less for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charges.
It has become increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find the overhead bin’s place.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website do not have to give it.
This means that the next person on the line may be given $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger on the line at a front door can get one bag free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check in's procedures are being changed to ensure passengers know about the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new career - on fee, will not start until summer although a date has not been set.
Passengers often manifest dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but airline services prefer them.
They argue that it costs money to handle luggage, and travelers who want service should pay for it.
Baggage charges on Wall Street are seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have not even touched the carriage-on bag fee though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first launched Carey-on-Pay three years ago, and partner discount company Allegiant Air later.
One such fee is Wizz Air of another Hungarian airline, as airline adviser J. Sorensen said, and who tracks the add-on fee.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit’s Carey-On fee brings $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former officer at Midwest Airlines recently surprised on the flight in Spirit and passengers had to face carry-on unusual bag charges at the gate.
“The boarding process I saw in my airline career was convenient,” he said.
I was hoping to brush my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The ship was full and he climbed that lickety-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit’s $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The Frontier claimed that the traveller who would take soda, or juice, could keep the whole box, and would give it free coffee only once.
It will keep the water away.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but seven months later after passengers complained they withdrew and followed any other major airline after being there.
Frontier’s passengers are their fresh efforts to drive customers to their own website if they don’t buy directly from the airline to charge a fee on the carrier-on.
The airlines pay the online travel vendor Orbitz such $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
That’s why all airlines have been encouraged to drive passengers to buy directly from them rather than go through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, many often started paying half the flight miles to customers who had purchased from an online travel agency from these individuals.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It also allows the only travellers to choose their seats in advance when purchasing directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its hometown in Denver, but its business is declining and it is losing money.
Revenue decline of 9 percent and its flight capacity declined by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by Corporate parent Republican Airways Holdings Inc.
Republican airlines are trying to determine the financing of Frontier as part of the sale.
N.S.A. accuses hackers of “internal errors” instead of website crashes
The secret National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical shortcomings, not because of hackers as some claimed online.
The intelligence agency said in an emailed statement, “NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight, due to an internal error occurring during a pre-determined update.”
The problem will be solved tonight.
This claim is not true that this barrier was caused by the Distributed Denial of Service [D.O.S.] attack.
On the evening, online server trackers found that NSA’s website was shut down for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still inaccessible.
An N.S.A. spokesman told ABC News that there was “no deal at all” with the agency’s internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said no classified information is in danger.
At least one hattivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the N.S.A. website by D.O.S. attacks.
D.D.O.S. attacks are designed in such a way that so much traffic is sent to the target website until the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unadvanced and the target attacks do not target the internal network of the system.
The ghostly highly secretive N.S.A., once referred to as “no such agency,” has become a subject of debate and co-criticism among the general public, facing too many events of foreign and domestic espionage programs over the past few months—the secret N.S.A. files stolen from the agency by the collectively destroyed ghostly former N.S.A. contractor Edward Snowden and followed by the ransomware.
Due to the so-called growing controversy about the agency, speculations followed after the incident tonight that, the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the fiction of "another theorist" showing harmony in the conditions of the Dapper era and today.
It was shown in the context of today which fleets are bound by a master to walk on the wrong path.
The opening of the drama was made by the main guests of the St. Joseph's Inter-College session, Governor General Walmick, Deputy Chairman of the Shivani Council, Kipra Rostogi, Mesh Consul and Power Singh jointly.
The drama depicted the synergy of the Dope era's theorist and the current circumstances of a professor Arvind.
In the directed drama, India भूषण शर्मा, अनिal शर्मा, vinod bechán, hemunt goyal, border sumer, vanishter chateau, abid sami, shiva gazala, अमित, rhum, argun etc. gave a fantastic presentation in full judgment with the characters.
The lighting system in the drama was designed by the young color maker Jicentr C. Regi and Set by Hemant Kumar.
In its above ceremony, various awards were awarded to literary, cultural contributors on behalf of OPTA.
It was given to Phase Singh Vivy’s Urdu Division President Dr. Asalam Jamshedpurie, senior journalist Shanshanath Shukla and colour maker Jakentr C. Raj.
The success of the event was contributed by Secretary सुरेंद्र शर्मा, Rakesh कौski, Abid Rigviy, etc.
Fall in Bombardier profits as delivery of aircraft, fall in orders
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc. a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from aircraft orders and deliveries in its railway unit in the third quarter and on contract issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also unveiled an update on issues that will release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or fulfill its ambitious program of going into commercial service from next September.
Approximately half a month before the first flight of the test aircraft, it has just been flown three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell below forecast and the stock has been sent to sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, shares lowered its ratings for “zone performance” from “matter” on Thursday.
“Low-capacity aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transportation,” Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are being announced in the coming months, there is doubt that the market program will be suppressed.
Bombardier hopes the plane family can now cut it off at the lower end of the dominant market of Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight testing to validate the company’s claims about the new jetliner’s fuel efficiency and potential cost savings, but as for CSeries, the firm order is up to 177.
403 complete orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudouin believed Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time of bringing the first jet into commercial use.
Officials convinced analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was running according to the schedule.
“The test aircraft remained on the ground longer than predicted,” Budin said in a conference call, adding that was also determined during the ground testing and software updates of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer creates schedules in a different way.
We decided to take a first flight and make an update period and said what we did.
That’s why it will all be through the flight program.
The second portion of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts believe customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft within the first 12 months after their first flight.
Bombardier has said it has evaluated the Service In-Entry (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – though in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – confirms our belief that in-flight service will be pushed into Q1/15,” Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended on September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
Adjusted income per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dropped slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, it was expected to generate revenues of 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said that a year ago, under 57, 45 aircraft were supplied during the quarter.
Net orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The airspace division’s backup was $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“Airspace, the results were in line with our guidelines, but the lower order consumption and overall market situation were a disappointment,” Budin said.
AeroSpace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said the world’s largest train manufacturer had increased revenue in the division by about 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were back-logged at $32.6 billion from about 30 September, up from a modest 31 December.
Some major contracts on the margins of the transport department were also affected by issues of execution.
Executive officials said the new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
In Bombardier’s shares, which Google Inc.’s chief financial officer Patrick Pitchett announced joining the board, Thursday’s mid-afternoon trade was also down by 8.5 percent at C$4.83.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world’s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, a 10 percent drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work in the morning with complete honesty and dedication.
Don’t lie to anyone and don’t think like stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our minds change and we begin to go against the rule of keeping an ideal aside.
In this research, researchers at Harvard University and Utah’s David Excels School of Business have given a number of interesting facts.
According to the researchers, mornings do not stress work, but honestness decreases due to fatigue or excessive pressure in the evening.
For this, the researchers made two uses.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
Meal, people had to tell if the point is more on the left or on the right.
Participants were told that if they answered incorrectly instead of correctly, they would be paid.
The experiment found that those who were tested between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistakes and answered correctly.
During an experiment on people between 12 a.m. and 6 p.m., it was found that they deliberately answered wrongly by putting their ears on the back.
This led researchers to prove that the greed of money in the morning doesn’t matter to our honesty, but in the evening we stop giving morality.
This research is published in a fresh issue of Psychological Sciences.
After the robberies, the robbers escaped.
The injured family was taken to hospital in serious condition.
The beautiful son of the resident of the Mountaineer village, Soehanवीर, has recently retired from the post of overseer engineer from the electrical department.
On Wednesday, he was returning home by bicycle with 44 thousand rubles from the Syndicate Bank.
Two cyclists, who came from behind on the road, beautifully robbed 44 thousand cash.
Beautiful resisted and the bandits shot him in the stomach, which wounded him.
Families and villagers who arrived at the information admitted them to the hospital in severe condition.
There was no report in the case until the news was written.
Recall that three days earlier, when he returned home from the bank, Ammanulapor resident Jassir was shot and wounded by two cyclists.
Police have not been able to uncover many of the recent cases.
Here, SO Sumer Singh Memory claimed that the incidents will be revealed soon.
The hotel staff opposed and Marty started.
The younger brother of the hotel owner, RK Singh, who came to rescue in the middle, and the son of a smoked deputy, started the attack.
In the meantime, many people came there.
Attempting to catch the martyr, he fired from the rifle.
The fire broke out in the area.
At the time, the hotel staff picked him up and called the police.
The hotel owner Muna Singh, who arrived at the stop, filed a report against Gorkhnath Pandey’s son, Joy Pandey, who is a resident of Berva Mountains.
The police arrested him for pleasure.
According to Handiya Inspector अशok Saraswati, Muna Singh runs a hotel called Ragh Barbar on the National Highway.
About 8 p.m. we arrived at the hotel and ordered dinner.
Late to cooking, he started gally-galous, marting and firing.
Joy was drunk and even threatened to kill the hotel staff.
The inspector says the hotel is on the edge of the village and is set off from the district.
Mr. Big sentenced to prison for cocaine addicted lawyer giving secret information about police investigation
42-Year-Old Survivor Datta Reported to Notorious Criminal Neil Scarborough
The Advocate Thought His Secret Drugs Could Make People Know About Drug Addiction
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison.
The top lawyer of the defense side, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation because he feared people would find out about his secret addiction to his narcotic drugs, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
After 42-year-old Barta Ditta compromised his cocaine addiction, notorious criminal Neil Scarborough provided sensitive confidential information about his investigation of drug trafficking activities.
This officer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and praised as "Top Bref" by criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous Narcotics trial.
Officials saw 32-year-old Scarborough holding three bags of cocaine at a lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
After found cocaine particles in Dita’s hair, her wallet, and her credit card, the investigation revealed that Dita was a “regular user” of class A narcotics.
During the eight-month period from January to August 2011, she attempted to illegally obtain information on behalf of Scarborough and his associate about the arrest of two people.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation of the heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Mercedeside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Among them were 32 other people who were sent to jail after being seized of £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine, and more than £200,000 in cash, during multiple imprints by police.
42-year-old Dita was informing criminals because she was afraid that people would be ignored about her cocaine addiction.
Dita, who worked in the law firm Forbes Solicitors, was found guilty in two cases of blocking the path of justice after a trial that lasted for three weeks in Liverpool Crown Court today after being faced with disappointment at Liverpool Crown Court.
He had agreed to hold cocaine in the previous hearing.
The lawyer’s bad time began when police discovered during Scarborough’s investigation that he had been in regular telephone contact with Dita since February 2011.
Two spies pursued the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and holding over 60 percent purity drug under the lawyer's bill in the Black Golf Glov.
Scarborough was in regular telephone contact after the drug was dropped, who went out for dinner at Blackren Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer arrived at home, he discovered that there was a narcotic drug and that there was a conversation between them nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was found to be a “regulated user” of cocaine during testing when traces of class A drug were found on Dita’s hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied her to use cocaine and said she was talking to a suspicious dealer because she was her client and said her discussions were a subject of “multi-privileges.”
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove many credit cards by pulling out his wallet, but they were seized, and her hair was sampled.
In a police interview, she said she was running an office from her workplace as well as from her home, and her clients were calling her home for various cases.
After being told by the main persons arrested what the spies knew about them, the court hearing said Dita was calling the leaders of the drug supply chain, some of whom the case she had previously submitted.
Annie White, on behalf of the prosecutor’s side, said: “A criminal advocate should know best about not breaking the law.”
Mr. Dita is accused of abusing his position as a criminal attorney, connecting too much with his specific client.
We’re not talking about the relationship of a general drug dealer, but rather about a dealer who is providing the drug to their lawyer.
Some of his conversations would have been divergent without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went somewhere beyond his lawyer-client relationship.
He interrupted police investigations as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting it.
He made a lot of closeness from certain clients, especially from Scarborough, and he allowed the deal with his freedom.
Dita denied any wrongdoing and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would work it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Deputy Representative Lee Halstad said: “When Mr. Dita began receiving narcotics from organized criminals, at the same time he turned himself from a criminal prosecutor to a criminal.”
Because of his cocaine addiction, he became excessively compromised and much more vulnerable to the targets of leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain critical information related to police investigations.
Advocates should maintain the highest standards of authenticity, and fill people with faith and confidence.
Mr. Ditta has cheated with this belief and has tried to escape his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit investigated Mr. Dita, which also found him guilty of three incidents of holding cocaine and now disrupting the path of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to court.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you to the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Fifty other members of the gang were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug crimes.
On her website, Dita gave questions and answers about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for a deadly client in the United States, to be Muhammad Ali’s dinner guest, and to be an inspiration for his work.
Kenya's Press Outraged on Controversial Media Law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying, “This is a terrifying place, and it’s legitimate to ask: What’s to stop parliament from depriving the judiciary of independence tomorrow?”
Capital Group, which is the operating company of Kenya’s most prestigious independent radio station and news website Capital FM, chief executive Sirus Chow said: “This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it.”
He said the new media jurisdiction "will always be partial, because it is the government itself" and that bans on subjects and advertising would undermine Kenya's place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to them to send back MPs by rejecting this bill.”
According to the Daily Star News, the new bill will provide the government with “strict control over the media,” while De Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been “stricken” and has brutally described the bill.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after an attack by Islamic gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenya’s media had broadcast security camera photos of the bombers sent to the scene of the attack, showing them intentionally looting the mall, causing officials to get angry with Kenya’s media.
Police chief David Kimao had sent two journalists and media workers to Sumen for interrogation, though the Sumen had been withdrawn after it had been haunted by the media.
Under the new bill, two million Kenyan shilling companies and separate journalists could be fined with ten million Kenyan shilling, with the additional risk of being “removed from the list” or not being recognized by the official press.
The court also has the right to seize the property of the infringer if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “One economy is enough to shake the foundation of most FM stations.”
It also said these measures could have the devastating effect that is described as Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
By closing the media’s mouth, politicians know they can do their belief.
The Nation's journalist Mutuma Matthew writes, describing Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life, "No one will ever know."
He wrote, “When left to the politicians, they will defeat the country and bring us back to the age of hunting and gathering.”
In the past, Kenyan legislators have faced the anger of the people.
In May, he refused to reject the cut-offs ordered by the National Wage Commission, and reinstated 532,000 shillings, tax-free wages, which are considered to be among the highest in the world.
The day of the wife of the world’s wealthiest Indian muckash Ambani is a November day, but as soon as the clocks of the night of October 30 rose twelve times, the whole of Jodhpur began to glimpse from the day of Neita Ambani.
Prior to this, the atmosphere of the celebration was entirely made up of the perforation of the AR Mermaid’s team.
At 8 p.m. in this musical night, Rahman presented his signature Sars.
Priyanka was on the stage to cheer the beautiful colors of the dance.
Approximately 32 charters arrived in the Jihad for the guests who joined in the Barth Day of Nita Ambani.
Due to the reduction of parking space at the Jaipur airport, the charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udhpur and Jaipur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars, including BMW, were sold.
Sud said that the city’s cleaning system, street lights have completely failed.
No steps are being taken by the City Company and Huda to run the Punchkula City Center.
He has decided to finish the plot completely.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Soud said that after the municipal elections the city has got new parliamentarians and mayors, but they do not have the power to work.
The city’s assembly has become a Damian and the officers are working on their own account.
Soud said that the city company has millions of dollars, but all the money is being recovered by depositing interest as FDs in banks.
No money is being put into the development of the city.
VK Soud said the problem of doping is the most serious.
Because of the creation of doping ground in Sector 23, people living in hogger cross sectors have been forced to live a native life over the past several years.
Officials of the city company have been talking about shifting the doping ground in the village of Zuriwa over the past several years, but people in the Berawa region are already getting twice as many as the serious problem of flies.
The state of the health services and education system in the villages has been completely damaged.
So far, no work has been started to provide facilities to people in the rural area.
The United Nations has set new targets to deal with disaster
The United Nations is about to immediately begin work on a new set of targets, which will replace the Twenty-Year Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to address global deprivation.
To replace the M.D.D. that ended in 2015, the Australian diplomat played a key role in advancing the “Transportable Development Goals” just before the transportable development summit that began overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gillard during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that it was time to “rise above national interests.”
He said: “I am very pleased that member countries have agreed to initiate and take the lead in the process of establishing the Universal Transportable Development Goals.”
These SDGs will be based on our development under the next year’s development goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to meet our ambitious targets of transmissible development goals based on the success of the M.D.G.
Topics of security concern in Mozambique are rising as strong people clash
With a statue of the founder of Mozambique President Samora, which looked down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo for peace in a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susana, chief executive of an investment company.
Worried about the future of her country, she changed her corporate dress from the printed "We demand security" t-shirt in Portuguese and joined the crowd of the Capital Independence Square on Thursday.
Conflicts between government feudals and Ra Namo have been almost daily for two weeks, since a peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
Ra Nemo was once a notorious rebellion of the then white-dominated Rhodesia and South Africa's colorful government-backed movement, initially as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to full-developed conflict, but recent events have upset foreign investors and locals.
Bets are high for the fast-growing economy, some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Eni, who discovered the vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves of the West Bank could bring about investments of more than $50bn next year.
The emerging Frelimo Party, the leading political power since 1975, and Ray Nemo blame each other for tensions.
Ray Nemo says the government launched its latest conflict on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in the Soffa la Province, a traditional Ray Nemo grave,
As attacks on former insurgents increased, government forces attacked Renmo bases and to the Financial Times that they attempted to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group’s leader, Fernando Moang, a spokesman for Re Namo.
Accusing the government of attacking soldiers, they blame Ray Nemo for triggering the confrontation.
President Armando Djibouti has urged to address concerns about instability.
Mr. Gibuzhan told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dakama saw himself as a “loser” “whether his armies were trying to prove that he could enforce his own decision on the government.”
Frey Limo and Ray Nemo both insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Moong was quoted as saying that Ray Nemo had canceled the 1992 peace agreement but later became a subject of concern.
He told FT meant that the deal was not being honored by Free Limo.
Our vision is to come back to the compromise negotiations, but seriously,” Mr. Moungne said.
The previous negotiations between the two sides did nothing special to ease the tense tension of a series of conflicts this year.
“It’s about the two big men (Jibutian and Thakama) fighting together,” said Joseph Han, a lecturer at London Open University and Mozambique expert.
They are not good conversators and neither are they prepared to make the kinds of arrangements that are necessary.
Ray Nemo, insisting on election reforms, had already said about the exclusion of the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force from the government as an attempt of a bullying movement to win the ransom and economic looting.
The share of Re Nemo in the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, a former Re Nemo member, was created in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) hopes to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Moong says Mr. Gibozhanko – who is due to resign next year at the end of his second term – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want to give up the nationalism because he doesn’t want peace, he doesn’t want transparent elections,” Mr. Moong said.
What kind of capacity Ray Nemo has has not been made clear, but it is a major North-South highway on police stations and vehicles on the regulatory hit-and-run tours he has made.
Most of the busts are located several hundred kilometers north of La Meca, in the province of Yomaputo, with the host Beer Port that relies on exporting mines, coal, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
Rio Railway suspended its trials for almost a week in June after threats to attack the Raimo Line.
Ray Nemo was almost questioned whether or not he would be able to replicate this danger.
Ray Namo “Things weren’t going well in Mozambique who wanted to get to know the international community,” Mr. Moong said.
The government of instability has further boosted the crowds, Fernando Lima, media cop, says, who is the head of an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of abductions.
“People who are responsible for the country’s future are the government and the president, and think he should be one to find solutions to the problems,” they say.
Omar Saltanat, an exhibitor, still needs persistence.
“No one cares about Re Nemo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models to a way for the author of life."
Thor's stories could show "There is no rivalry of subtle tricks in cruel power," while Economic legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths would not even be suitable to teach “unreasonably far away wild and in some cases even pornographic and taught in schools,” Cross Lee Holland advocated one of the age-appropriate tasks of “precautionary selection.”
“I find it surprising, in America, myth and populism are already part of the field of education,” he said.
I’m thinking of it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers “more speakers” and it’s “a new turn” for children, with messages being “performed” into entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Biowolf from Anglo-Saxon as well as wrote the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: "Your intentions may be many but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
Per an adult writer for a sanctuary and an adult writer for an adult require some meanings of hope for a big difference.
Because everything is simplified or come to a happy end, but it is an inherent feeling of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than being told revealed through a story.
There is no old foundation.

Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People may argue that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, comedian comedian Frank Fae, who served as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began speaking jokes directly to people sitting in the crowd in a way of interaction.
Fe's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Fest.
Designed and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Stand Up Institute named Carolines, this festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, featuring more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
Hirsch says, “Most of these headliners appeared in the Caroline’s, and became a huge success, to the point where they became too big to be played in the club.”
We built this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s program includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, “Stand Up for Heroes” featuring other artists including Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
Along with the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this year’s celebration have come from non-peripheral media, such as Comedy Central, F.X. and shows coming on smaller networks like Spike.
Nick Crawl reached the prominent spot from Deep-Cable Sitcom (the famous "If League" with FX's fuzzy ranch fantasy-football theme), and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slett has been cast members of “Saturday Night Live” and “Park and Recreation”, although they are best known for their warrior video series “Marcel de Shel by Shuzon On.”
Including Crawl and Slate, other young comedians with different voices (Anthony Jesselnik with an entirely different disappointing voice, violent, ethnically-focused W. Commodore Bell) are the products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the celebration will be an interview: Talking to Larry David of David Steinberg:
Steinberg began working as a stand-up comedian, but he has become a nomadic television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy by David Steinburg" on TV Land.
The meeting will be in the center of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
Steinberg said, “The city is in the comedy DNA of all Larry’s works.”
They were telling me that, when he was here, sometimes they went into a cage between two buildings and thought in themselves that if I ever lost all my money I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall to $96 per barrel
A report showing concern over increased supply on Friday, which continues to fall toward oil prices, offset where the power-hungry construction sector in China is becoming stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery in electronic trading in Europe at the U.S. Raw New York Market Exchange was down 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel by late morning.
Contracts fell 5.8 percent for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
A sufficient supply of crude oil has tossed on the price in recent weeks.
Energy Department said on Wednesday that U.S. supply has increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
Over five weeks, supply has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But a suggestion of stronger demand in activity revealed by Izafa that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came Friday.
This suggests that growth could continue to strengthen China’s economic reform after falling down in the previous quarter by 7.8 percent in a two-decade third quarter.
Brent raw also fell from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refiners, to 26 cents.
Court has blocked action on New York Police Department's break and crack policy
A federal appeal court on Thursday blocked changes requiring a break from the New York police department and a judge’s order for the crack program and removed the judge from the case.
Shira Schindler, a judge at the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal 2 End, has said that the judge’s ruling will delay the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the city had ruled in August of violating the constitution in such a way as it prevented people from interrogating and interrogating them.
The City Police Department has appealed to its findings, including the decision to allocate a surveillance to help change its policy and related training programmes.
The Court of Appeal heard litigation on the request for travel on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal has said that because it compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a series of media interviews and differs from the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by the public, misconduct should therefore be removed from the judge’s case, statements should be publicly held accountable for criticizing the court.
The judge ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its break and crack program.
He has appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes including economic improvements in policies, training and surveillance, and he has ordered a pilot program for testing body-weared cameras in some of the campuses where most shut down.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were rejected after a police arrest.
A verbal argument on the city’s appeal is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
The break and crack tips have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The break and crack policy has been around in some form for decades, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, 684330 will record a all-time high from 2011 to prevent a dramatic rise under the administration of Independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men of all minorities and became a case of class action.
Supporters of the change in the NYPD's break and crack program have said that unfair behavior will end by shaping a more reliable and effective police force and may affect the use of other police department policies.
Opponents say changes will lower the police mentality, but will solve a widespread problem of a police force under pressure from crime, money wasted and not shattered by thousands of officials over the past decade.
The judge noted that the pause and the end for the crack were not put in place, which is constitutional, but improved the implementation of the NYPD’s stop.
In the training, the participants of Godda, Pakuad, Jamsedpur, Moneybad, Hajaribag and Chagri district participated in a considerable number.
During the seven-day period, all participants were informed of several studies including tent pitching, flag pole.
The duty of training is being fulfilled with the cooperation of Dr. Ashtosh Kumar's opinion and Isaac's announcement.
When all religions join in prayer, all participants share a sense of unity.

Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Colson, a former ghost editor of News of the World, has been accused of using “phone hacking, surveillance, and public-facing” in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clark’s domestic secretary during his stay.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis Q.C. told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was associated with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper appointed private investigator Glenn Mulker to hack Paulby’s voice-sample and “keep the man in mind,” but Colson also called and left his voice-sample.
Mr. Edis said: “The opposition suggests that Mr. Colson, who is now the editor of N.O.T.W., doesn’t stand outside people’s homes to watch them, but instead keep articles in front of people, to see what people react to it.”
He said that N.O.T.W. used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third group included the editors themselves.
He knew the other way, he knew the other way.
What about the first?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, “Yes, he knew exactly.”
The rumors about Clark’s fledgling spouses were first introduced by A.O.T.W.’s feature desk at the time, when a sexually keen source in Miss Paulby said, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
In August 2006, from Mulkeyer’s home, Sister Polby’s phone tape was seized at least three times.
Investigators also found such entries in the private investigator’s computer, on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named “Project.”
During the period in which his investigation was being conducted, Ms. Polby’s grandmother was called by anonymous telephone to ask for information about him.
During this time, Phantom-Early Chief Reporters Neville Thurbelbek and Phantom-Early Reporters James Wederup watched the arrival and arrival of Sushri Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told them through a voice-sample, "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I definitely want to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis said Collson’s involvement in this case is in the same parton with other key figures, such as the ghost-ex-domestic secretary David Blunt.
The judge heard on Monday that Colson had talked to Mr. Blunt about pre-emptive relationships with a married woman, while at the time he was looking at the case of co-representative Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to interfere with others to hack their phones between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkier, Hurlbeck and WeatherUp have accepted the phone hacking.
Increased carport fear from NSA disclosures about state surveillance.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter crashed into the U.S. commercial embassy in the financial capital of Germany, Frankfurt.
On the instructions of the Office for the Defense of the Constitution (BfV), the mission of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency was to photograph the roof of the U.S. quarter, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of the leasing antenna and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the United States and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. would not use its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal business secrets from foreign companies and send U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or boost their bottom line.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who made Wieselblower, began to reveal the treasures of his mystery to the U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director will keep his promise.
The U.S. National Security Agency said it spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo and Yahoo expressed concerns about the surveillance of the country.
The last thing came when it turned out that Chancellor Angela Markle’s phone was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe’s most powerful individuals can be targeted, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit.
“Germany should wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by Consultancy of German companies, the United States has almost now become a big risk when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such as China.
All the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, there is no evidence so far that the United States has known the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union. and it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are suspicious of this.
Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
Hosso Plattner, president of German business software company SAP, said: “This is no way.”
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he didn’t have to die 20 years ago.
Everything runs in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
But IT industry is everything.
The revelations revealed by Snowden about U.S. technological advancements and espionage access have proved to be a trauma for some companies who previously believed the biggest surveillance threat is China.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing sector where European officials are more aware that data stored in the U.S. is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, a business entity, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members cancelled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s co-CEO says: “We saw a new question that didn’t come to customers a year ago – that is – is my data said is stored? and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most invaluable secrets and data and therefore need to be aware of them at all costs.
That economic espionage is not a surprise.
It has always happened.
“It’s been a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussions, nothing has changed,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
The US spies on us at the commercial and industrial levels and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in defense and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, long-time messaging records are being recorded whether leaving a home-to-home business with usb stick, or leaving a laptop in a hotel room is incomprehensible at least to say.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member of car maker Audi, says it’s a year-old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they can’t be used as remote listening devices.
Germany’s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile when smart phones are compromised due to risks on overseas routes.
The pre-paid cell phone was later thrown away.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many companies are active in the global market in a special place.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access,” BfV warns in a report.
The United States has warned of economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to France's The Washington Post, the US National Intelligence named in February Russia and Israel in a second layer of criminals involved in hacking for economic intelligence that is behind China.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explained in an interview: “The services know well that all countries spy on their allies even if they participate in a non-terrorist battle.”
The US spies on us at the commercial and industrial levels and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one is stupid.
Georgia's teenager's parents believe their son was murdered
A Georgia teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a restaurant mat in his high school gym believes his son was murdered, a family spokesman said on Tuesday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, G.A., was found trapped in a mat standing straight behind the Blitchers inside his high school gym on January 11.
London County Sheriff’s investigators concluded that Johnson died in a “small accident,” but the 17-year-old’s family denied it.
Benjamin Crump, a spokesman presenting Kennedy and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News: “They fully believe that their son has been murdered.”
They are not at all confident in the way Sheriff tells them.
Cramp said: “They believe that this is beyond the physical laws and the rational reasoning of common intelligence.”
They think this conclusion is an excuse for protecting the person or people responsible for their son’s death.
He said "he had sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag."
U.S. Attorney General Michael Originary said on Monday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, considering that many important questions have emerged.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder a crime?
Murray spoke about this at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever we go.
My goal is to bring the truth in front of me.
He said: “My opinion is that there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation.”
Moore told reporters that randomized body tests find indications that Johnson's death resulted from "static respiratory dysfunction."
According to Murray, a second body test revealed a different cause of death.”
“There are so many questions that need to be answered or confirmed.”
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to refer to a criminal or to investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to do so.
Representatives from the Lange County Sheriff’s office were not immediately available for comment when they were contacted on Sunday.
On Wednesday, a judge in South Georgia ordered officials to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy’s parents say they hope to find some clues from the video footage about how his death occurred.
CDC Releases Children's Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control children’s food allergies in schools.
Such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government for the first time, as the number of children who go to school suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now every 20th child in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the cases of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
This guideline informs schools about how to inform teachers and staff about children’s food allergies, and how to deal with them in the event of an allergic reaction.
Students have also been suggested that they hold stock of epinephrine to potentially cope with anaphylaxis – the auto-injector of the epinephan brand that is most commonly used.
The State Assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily store more amounts of epinephrine.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children may say, “It feels like something is chewing on my tongue,” “It feels like there’s hair on my tongue,” or “It’s swallowing in my tongue.”
Intersex kids’ parents can choose their children’s ‘sex undefined’
Germany has become the first European Union country to recognize a third gender for children born with unclear genitalia.
Newborn babies will no longer be prescribed as male or female.
Under the new law, parents are not required to declare gender for such children, the law allows them to declare gender “defined” or “unspecified” on the child’s birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make hasty decisions related to gender-specific surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I will continue to be the poisonous, peanut butter made by doctors.
It is estimated that every year one in 2,000 children has a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of approximately 60 conditions, which fall under the examination of disorders of sexual development, this is the collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or ovaries), or abnormally developed sex.
Per it was Wallace Simpson who was intersex.
Gender identity is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender-determination cannot be done, it is better to use the best available information to specify gender and to observe the child’s psychological and physical development before surgery occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dresser, who is an expert on gender identity matters, said Germany’s new law “appears to be a good thing.”
Intersex children create moral discord.
He said, “Some people are in a life-like condition that requires surgery, but that’s not the case with most children.”
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a child’s gender will develop is not very accurate.
No one can give a reasonable answer to why this happens.
This is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In a report submitted to the European Commission in 2011, intersex people were described differently than transgender or transgender people, because their status is not related to gender but to its biological composition, which is neither clearly male nor female but either a combination of both or none of the two is clearly defined.
These characteristics themselves may exhibit secondary sexual preferences, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breasts and length; primary sexual preferences such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in cosmetic structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of employment, as well as persecution, violence and advocacy crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-appropriate sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark male, female or “national gender” on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie Me-Welby became the world’s first recognized “sexless” person after winning a legal appeal to maintain a “unspecified” gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the German passport will also be the third specification as an X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, gender-related issues in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition to return the "sex theory" from school books.
U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed this German law, saying, “While the world is going to a state where gender is the choice of choice, but not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby Jones that she would like to see children be specified gender at birth.
He said on the website about parenting, “Parenting without additional limits is very stressful, especially if you don’t even know what your child’s gender is.”
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, babies born with both male and female genitalia were called hermafrodites (ufilians), named after the beautiful Greek god who was bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the penis as a slice that could be erased and then written.
But now that many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are understanding that gender recognition is a complex task, and sometimes it can be the mistake of doctors who don’t know what children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
Dresser says “In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a “mental emergency.”
When these babies were born, you didn’t call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The existing theory of treating children with ambiguous genitalia was presented by Dr. John Money of the John Hopkins University, who considered gender improved.
He composed the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental signs – how parents raise a child – determine whether he is identified as a man or a woman by interacting with the child’s genes and hormones.
But in a case in 1966, known as “John/John,” his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose gender was accidentally sexually transmitted during the Linguagram-Urghenad (Sercussion) that they should fully bind the child and let his ovaries come out and act like his lustful girl.
Dresser said, “Manny presented that case as a successful case of the prospects, but it didn’t happen.”
At the age of 15, the child turned back into a man and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still “following the same pattern.”
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after the 1990s, individuals undergoing these genital surgery began to emerge “not happy with the outcome.”
The same case was with Montana’s 36-year-old author Jim Bruce, who was born with an XY male cranium, but his genitals were vague.
The doctors didn’t clearly understand whether her penis was small, or her penis was larger, but they were sure that she could never live a “comfortable life” as a man.
So some time after her birth in 1976, Bruce's outer organs and uterus were removed by surgery and her survival became like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, “I knew I wasn’t a girl.”
I wasn’t happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, he was going to have vasoplastics with him.
But feeling depressed and somewhat confused, she sought medical records.
It revealed him the terrible truth.
When I was born I was bound - and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from producing sufficient amounts of testosterone, causing his genitals to not develop properly.
After learning the truth, she became a man back, took testosterone supplements and cut her breasts.
He was removed because of the medical condition.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to make their perceptions normal.
But, California-based diversity group Advocates for Informed Choices executive director Annie Tammer-Matis expresses concern that Germany’s law “invites chips and crackers.”
They say, “Many activists think that Germany’s law will inspire parents to make quick decisions and specify the child as “determined.”
We fear it will encourage interference.
We think that rather than waiting, it is better to specify male or female gender.
But we don’t know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tammer-Matis said his organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be identified in the third gender.”
He said, “Adults about multi-gender should be able to make their own decisions.”
German law determines the date of birth.
This is not a war that is being fought by newborns at this time.
As they grow up, decisions dependent on their body they can make themselves.
But Pittsburgh breast radiologist Dr. Erlene Barrettz whose daughter has a sexual developmental disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany’s law would “give power” to both parents and children.
Baratji’s daughter Katie was born with male crusts, but she had a D.S.D. called a complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her androgen was defective in the gray, female anesthesia developed in Katie.
He has a vagina in his body, but no uterus or diarrhea.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and is a resident at the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Though she is a spouse, she expects to become a mother through adoption or gestational sarogacy.
Barratt said, “This law makes it easy for parents not to make any decisions themselves in a hurry.”
This gives them time to properly understand and test through some tests before writing ‘man’ or ‘woman’.
In this way, you stay fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and have fun with her.
We don’t need to do such urgent surgery that can’t be reversed.
He said, “It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the outrageous obsession because they don’t believe they’re getting better.”
Eventually, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable with—and that would be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal awareness camp was held in the mid-school district of Ramsar under the chairman and chairman of the district committee and all judges of Ramsar.
In which students and others were informed of the law for the right to education and economically backward people.
In the camp, Advocate M.L. Gupta, Rohin Indravadze, and Sirpach awakened people as they talked about the subject.
A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Biden dumping for Hillary Clinton on Obama campaign considerations.
According to the New York Times, close advisers of President Barack Obama have secretly considered Hillary Clinton in the place of Biden for the vice president's post ticket for 2012.
The most remarkable outbreak in Revelation is the heavily anticipated 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heleman, Tom, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and said on Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "comprehensive group meetings and polls in late 2011" to find out what dumping Biden could help in the hope of Obama's re-election fall.
According to the Times national political reporter Jonathan Martin, the book tells the full details of the campaign of the chief officer and the White House, named for the former White House staff chief bill, to find out what the ex-state secretary Clinton's change from vice president affects the pole.
The potential switch was a very secure secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s close advisors – including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Machina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlarod and David Pallouffe – knew the change was questionable.
"Double Down" claims that Daley attempted to change Biden despite his personal tact, eventually making a decision before his information was telling him that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration actually considered Clinton’s place with Biden.
"I said keeping the whole scene in sight, and one of them, it was," Dale told the newspaper.
You remember, when the presidency was in danger, we were in a situation like, “Holy Christ, what else will we do?”
While Dale described the research as “precautionary,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had made significant investments in finding out how profitable this claim would be when it became Polish.
“Campaigns don’t spend on voting and focusing groups like Peso unless they’re seriously considering something,” Martin told AC360.
It’s unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss knew about the possible change.
While Daley said they "don't think the president was aware of the possible change," the former chief of staff believed it was "likely" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" is certain: will not answer whether the political investigation reached Obama's desk?
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama Biden was unaware of the dumping ticket research.
“Per,” Martin said.
Do you like dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using gelifish.
Charlie Francis has taken great advantage of marine animals to develop the best breakfast.
He came to this idea after reading a research paper on gelifish and convinced Chinese scientists made the use of chemical gloss on re-glossing proteins.
Ice cream, eaters who react with the tongue will increase the pH level of protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream reacts with the warmth of the mouth, i.e. the more you win, the more it becomes.
Charlie, founder of Lick I.M. Delisius Ice Cream Company, said: “It’s incredible but the production of the early days will get me about 2 grams of stuff from £200.”
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth gets hot, the protein pH level will increase and the ice cream will shine.
We’ve been crawling for the past few months and it’s seeming perfect to share on Halloween because it gives a wonderful gloss effect.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream ever made because the gloss of gelifish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around £140.
However, iska taste is very good.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol, apne is famous for its unusual tastes including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaves.
But his next creation is even more important.
He said: “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It’s naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think we’ll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the usefulness of the prestigious properties of a gelifish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
The Queen's Garden Market was full of customers.
Recently, people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy pots.
This is where we have been at the Central Market located in Wizirpur, Apontika Rohini, Naharpur, Ahasok Vihar Central Market, and Pacific Vihar.
Something like that was also seen in the nearby Pitampura, अशok Vihar, and the model town's surf shops.
They also bought gold and silver coins.
Because of this, the outer ring roads included in other markets also appeared.
However, the people who came home from Aphis had to spend hours in shelter to get home.
Halloween 2013: by numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay silent late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I’ve become more than a lion.
I didn’t sign in to give candy out of my apartment for the past two years, and probably not this year.
But the statistics tell me when a black sheep comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually spending $158 million on Halloween this time, $6.9 billion on Kennedy and on costumes and decorations.
One thing I’ve always seen is the Halloween trends.
According to NRF, the total cost of clothes is estimated at $6.9 billion at $1.2 billion.
This year, all of the sexy non-living objects are angry.
Women don’t have to be overwhelmed; because they’re also sexy eating jesse’s pizza, hamburgers and cakes.
There are so many zombies I hope for for men, and thanks to the transformation of the dead will make our Instagram feeds for space men this year.
According to Google, the most popular dresses will be zombie, batman, lottery and witches.
I think there is nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dog and we were not alone.
According to NRF, Americans will literally spend $330 million on pet dresses.
This is the amazing thing that a lot of hotels have with dogs.
When it comes to Candy, we don’t see around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Healy Bars, Lollipop, Milk Dads, Twilight and Clark Bars are around £600 million.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it’s good news that 41 million trick-side tricks are taking part in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and those who are joking, will buy £90 million in chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we won’t use is candy during Halloween, but it will also sell around 35 million pounds.
He is about Macca’s personal asset of 9 billion.
This is a mystery. yet to solve
Nothing is more elementary than the halloween ghosthouse.
They had the best names, “the horror behind the wall (which,in fact, is a jail), “the face-of-the-face” and were like “the house of shock.”
In fact, according to the American authorities, the 1200 is officially the home of the monstrous ghost in the United States, which generates 500 million monasteries. and the terrible goodness that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and commented on you.
Finally, let’s talk about the caterpillar.
Charlie Brown introduced the great straw when we were children, and a jack-o-roulette sketch is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were young.
For us, the "Baby In A Pumpkin Trend" started last year only thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with these guards and didn't sell with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend around $106 million on garlic.
Jack-o-slowly melting luthin on its front porch probably from Illinois, which this year raised 542 million pounds of strawberries.
If you’re looking for extra loans, call Tim and Susan Mothers in Napa, Caliph., and try to scratch their 2,032 pounds of strawberries.
The MCA said in a statement, “It was decided that the mailing ticket with a photo of Sikh was released from the start of the match during the previous presentation.
Then there will be a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
In addition, a special coin will be used for the TOS, which the MCA will handle.
The MCA will also release a 64-page booklet, which will include articles related to the Tendulkar and statements from people from the business, sports and journalism world about them.
The union said that this limited number of billboards and coins will be distributed to members of the MCA and BCCAI.
Every day, 10,000 masks, 10,000 scoring cards and 10,000 towels will be distributed, including photos of Sikh.

Traffic traders' dreams of doing business in the Pattaya market located in the Transport Area did not come true.
Pattaya merchants are trapped in the mess after the order of the High Court.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary Patacha market built on Rangit Avenue, nor have they been licensed to trade in the transport area.
A commission formed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court declared the temporary Pattaya Market located on Ranjit Avenue unsafe during its visit.
There was also a fine of ten million rubles for the Deputy Commissioner of Amterson because of the inappropriate proceedings.
In his order, the High Court blasted the administrative officials of Amterson, saying that such an administration has not been able to solve a difficult problem for the tradesmen for nine years.
They cannot be placed in a proper place in the city.
Subsequently, the appropriate security management ordered Pattaha traders to issue licenses for business in the market located in the shipyard.
After this order, even the Pattaya merchants were happy, but on their joys, the police drove water on Friday.
The police's real license brunch team arrived in the Pattaya market and sold the farm by placing a counter there.
After that, what they were told was impossible to accomplish in one day.
ACP East Gorge Gorge, Incharged Unpop Komar of the Assalha License Branch, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma arrived in the Pattacha Market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the operations carried out by the Pattaya traders.
Therefore, the traders were not granted licenses.
The puppy has one day left.
The tradesmen are troubled.
They are looking at the loss of millions of rubles.
Pattaya merchants Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Hrysh Phuvan, Hrysh Phuvan, Desarah, Surinam Singh, Manzindr Singh and Gini say that if they have lost millions of rubles, they will claim district administration.
Angry Pattaya merchants drove the Roish March from the shipyard to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
The police and the gendarmerie.
After that, the business was also closed in the temporary Pattaha Market in Ranjit Avenue.
Firefighters called to rescue a lost puppet on the crashing mountain slope 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after coming into a small street crash
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine.
Firefighters dropped the front of the rock down the rope to save the dog from the mouth of death
After somehow stuck on a crashing mountain slope 50 feet above the ground by Poppy, he found a lucky life by being called by firefighters.
The nine-month-old cocker Spaniel Ruby fled after coming into a street crash on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
Their owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Bakky Hall, 20, were in a flatbed mine in West Yorkshire to meet again with Denhom, Ruby, and they have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After her departure after a minor accident, she searched like crazy for her lost dog, and appeal was posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday afternoon at 2.15 a.m., a sharp eye-catching Doc Walker looked at Ruby, on the mountain in the mine at a height of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue crew from the Claykton Fire Station arrived at the scene and dropped down by rope to save Ruby and used a stomach tube to bring him down from the rock.
Technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a critical situation.
He was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet above and 50 feet below.
He did not do a single step during the rescue, he remained a stone.
But now he is good.
Then he was eating biscuits.
It was an unusual call for help.
It’s incredible to see the dog.
Special technical rescue officer Peter Law said "Ruby is lucky enough to survive."
It was likely that he was seriously injured or even in a worse situation.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found well in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
Haleyfax, West Yorkshire's Miss Hall said it was "horrible to see the rescue operation"
At first I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It is exciting to get him back into your hands.
The veterinarian said that if she gets very tired and falls, she will definitely fall down.
The firefighters did a very good job.
What he did was really courageous.
We’re all proud of them, and they were all the best.
Mr. Alderson from Keigley also said, “We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there.”
The firefighters did a great job.
I couldn’t believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger Says When Katie Perry Was 18 Years Old, She Didn't Hurt Her
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Poon Star said he had sung backing vocals for the 2004 Jagger song "Old Hobbits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dinner with senior rockers, and “When I was 18, they struck me.”
He said, “This thing is outdated, and he treats me well.”
The 70-year-old Jagger's representative said on Monday in a statement that he "clearly refuses to ever bet on Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Perry is probably talking about them in the misunderstanding of another person."
Parry was one of the singers who came as guests on the Rolling Stone Tour this year.
His new album “Prism” reached the top spot this week.
George Kerry: Euro disintegration gave Scots a choice
Another Day, Another Story of Fear of Freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will need to join as an independent travel area across Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Indicate stories about passport controls on Barwick and the boundaries of the wire on the walls of Hadrian.
It is true that the Strathclyde Paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although – predictedly – it was not described in the headlines.
Neither did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen region, Brussels would be an inexpensive discount for Brussels for sustained non-compliance in exchange for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
And then, the story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has been frozen.The first thing I heard was the Babylonian news about 40 years ago that "independence means passport control."
Nevertheless, this interesting point has been lost in telling the old story again.
Why Should We Expect Independent Scotland to Bidding Europe Anyway?
Why buy-sell London’s York for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Groups dedicated to opposing the EU or closing the euro as a single currency across the EU are getting strengthened.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party – which has been founded this year alone – suddenly arrived and won fifty million votes in the September federal election, thus effectively pushing the Free Democrats (our equivalent of their Liberal Democrats) out of the base.
The plan to build a federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis has proved to be a mutant.
Along with the strict regulations imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, barriers imposed on national economies by adhering to the same currency have forced many to think that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not play much part in the excessive budget losses of national governments — this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized its members’ exchange rates in favor of German exporters – something German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a situation with an underlying loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only measure is to reduce wages and public spending – which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Current budget and currency problems go far beyond deep European productivity.
To provide discount to French and German energy companies on consumer spending - as a result of Brussels' "held" energy policies, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times for gas than the United Nations.
It’s the cost-loss that we’ve already seen in Greengammauth.
Even if all wages in the world are frozen, the European petrochemical industry cannot save from being affected by inexpensive US shale gas.
The resulting sentiment of rebellion is erupting in the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the Yugoslavia, top French politicians saw the EU as a measure to keep control of Germany, and to provide Paris with billing equal to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing France’s economy to crumble.
Result: Marine Le Pen’s south-left, anti-EU National Front has won a recent competition by pushing the ruling socialist to third place.
At the moment, the Front is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - it's a timely warning to the British Labour that they can't go by assuming that disintegration for the left, self-benefit for the right, is the haaga.
What is Lee Penn doing with his newly won fame in the middle of French whites, the working class?
This party wants to use the next year’s EU elections to create an anti-EU, all-out anti-currency group in the European Parliament.
If, as is most likely, EU opposition parties perform well in these elections, this type of gang could impact the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: soon the anti-EU and anti-currency spirit in Europe will put an end to the euro.
The euro will not end entirely, but it will come back in some form of "Europe of (sovereign) nations" backed by General De Gaulle.
Germany and some of its experimental economies may retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the U.K. itself to keep away from this project in the hope of increasing proximity with the U.S.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland next?
We can choose to stay in the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland could perform better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It would be easier to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe of non-federal nations.
Otherwise, we should considerining our economic independence while on the path to Norway.
The S.N.P. government in Scotland has – remarkably – been conducting the most successful anti-imperialism political campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of the (so-called) coup proposed by Labour Chancellor Elistair Darling and his subsequent Tory-Lib Dam alliance.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as in that situation it would have to accept the rules of parish imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Age: Growing Up Soon
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls reach adolescence at a younger age than blond girls of their own age.
Physical change doesn’t mean that youth is overwhelming
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed.
Experts believe that stagnation outbreaks, may be a cause of youth at a young age
The case of premature youth is not as effective in boys
CNN’s former ghost reporter Pat Etheridge is an expert journalist on children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter begins to develop breasts and genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
This week at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz clarified that these initial physical changes are common among American girls, these new moves reflect.
Kaplowitz says, “I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – that this generally does not reflect smooth progress towards full youth.”
Direct symptoms of development such as the germination of the breasts, the hair of the genitals and hips and the physical smell appear prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades there have been very slight changes in the age of resonance (first menstrual religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
“It takes at least two to three years for the first menopause to develop when the breasts begin to develop,” explains Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Primary adolescence in girls: a necessary guide to addressing this common problem.”
The most accurate test of youth development is the time.
What is the beginning of adolescence is debated, but when there is an increase with breast growth before the age of 8 years, two call it “child-growth.”
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop – which pediatricians can observe closely.
In cases of more severe progression, examination by an endocrinologist may be necessary to eliminate the chances of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences: premature pre-age growth of bones, which can cause undeveloped growth and nasal retardation as an adult.
The structures for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child’s age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovits are obsessed with drugs but admit, “Suppressing adolescence can increase behavioral problems, and girls may start to feel different from their peers.”
A second big problem can be understood: Parents just don’t want their younger daughter to have menstruation.
Kaplowitz said, “They’re concerned about the risk of pregnancy, or how they’ll maintain hygiene.”
A woman whose daughter had begun menstruation at the age of 10 recalls, “It was a shock.”
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstrual religion, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was frightened from her school and returned upset that her first menstrual religion had begun.
There are many improved theories about the causes of abnormal youth.
Nevertheless, there is no sustained evidence that milk or other food particles can be accused of hormones, chemicals in the environment or gender-provoking messages in the media.
The boys too – just like the girls – are getting early youth.
Caplovites determine the rule that its main cause is the outbreak of localization.
He helped run a study on girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, linking body fat with adolescence.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty before their age-old blonde girls.
There are many explanations for this.
On a global scale, the imitation of premature youth, from economic conditions to weather and jeans, seems to be influenced by everything.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the course of adolescence is not as obvious in them as girls.
Other doctors attending the A.A.P. conference supported the complications of the subject.
Even in infants and children it has become common to see nausea and genital hair.
Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Lawrence Silverman at the Goryeeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, says, “We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of youth.”
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their children about it.
Kaplowitz advised, “This could mean negotiating before the expected time.”
If you stay calm, your child will normally respond correctly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it’s happening prematurely, it’s part of normal life.
The temperature dropped by 3.1 degrees Celsius.
The rainy and cold weather of Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
People dressed in sweaters and went to their destinations.
When the first rain of the winter came, the people also removed the rains.
In the morning, people enjoy the sun.
When the weather changes, you will also get a lot of relief from the sickness, but after that the sun shade continues to shadow the clouds all day long.
The children also went to school wearing sweaters.
According to the Air Force Weather Department, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature 13.7 degrees Celsius.
7.8 mm of rain was recorded.
According to the weather department, clouds will continue to shade in the sky.
On the big orders bets of jet manufacturers from dispute for seat width.
This month’s Dubai Arshou has taken a breakthrough in setting pace for battle among leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The dispute is focused on the width of the economy-class seat in long-haul aircraft, not always as given by airlines, but whose outstanding space efficiency has been claimed to be key by Latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus has hoped to give an extensive seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy cabin this week such an industry standard but it should be decided by airlines, says its chief executive Boeing.
The dispute between the aircraft manufacturer comes when it began to sell the larger version of the twin engine of the long-distance Aircraft from the possible orders recorded after the 17-21 incident.
How is the aircraft’s previous department built—especially whether seats are equal to 9 or 10—the designs of mini-Jumbo jets are being prepared taking into account the overcapacity devoo?
Boeing says it has built the “777 X” that will hold 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in a single department.
Airbus says that while flying with the A350 it will take 350 people in equal seats left 18 inches.
Aircraft giants often trade on technical issues through advertising in the business press.
Now, with the Airbus 777 X, Dubai Arshou hopes to dominate over 100 orders, which is further appealing to the public.
Recently it’s being seen that the beginning of the war is going to be anything, showing this to the Finnsero together in a restaurant three at a time, will you accept it?
Airbus Sales Chief John Laye said “Boeing is also offering long-distance flights to shuttle seats from regional turbo.”
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way to sit on the plane is not a reward.
According to U.S. Department of Health data, in the mid-1970s when Boeing 747 Jumbo ne modern long-term ki travel ko defined tha, and the century's ant me average 40-49-year-old American male ke weight me increased by 10 percent.
According to American Health Statistics, the average American man in the 21st century is 39.7 inches tall.
Airbus says its rival has clinged to a seat concept of the 1950s when the new name "Jet Set" was the average perimeter shrinkage.
Airbus says it has established a research commission that suggests an additional inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing has challenged Airbus’ seat measurement statistics, saying it’s not dependent on manufacturers’ decision on how airlines balance rental and amenities.
It also says, research shows that the width of a seat depends more on the experience of the cabin.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Crawler said: “It really tells airlines about giving them flexibility and what they believe they need to do to succeed.”
“They don’t want to tell us what they benefit from.”
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers, it’s about the elbow room, but for suppliers it’s a growing problem that it can affect income.
The trade behind this dispute is estimated to be at least $700 billion, the competition in aircraft orders is enough in the coming decades to tap the tide of U.S. and European exports.
Reuters that for the first time in July, which seat layout is actually a fighting issue between new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent workload per seat in their new twin engine design, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Air.
Boeing’s performance claims depend on the 777 X with 10 compared to the 777 design with the original 9.
Comparison of 10 equal to the benefit in unit cost has now been used.
Kevin Kenniston, head of Airbus passenger facility in Europe says “Boeing is doing it to occupy more seats to make their aircraft more competitive with our products.”
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-by-line cabin for the existing 777 S suggests that many passengers are on the side of the Dencer layout, which can also go with cheap rental.
Cabin interior expert My Corby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network said: “The eighteen-inch seat width will remain great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is powered by the threat of the 777 offer.”
Airbus and Boeing are not supplying seats but are providing a list of suppliers to choose from for airlines.
Jet vendors around the world will also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
While more relaxing, all builders are also giving jet aircraft low-cost aircraft services and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equivalent A350 but says it hasn’t been sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized wider cabin seats on some of its jet aircraft for the need for more cabin facilities.
Modern jet aircraft are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it could distract from the 777 X wave of sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine May End Smoking Enjoyment
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can end smoking-related migraines.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Tests on humans require further testing before they begin, which may take years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Will Cornell Medical College in New York, said the oral signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said: “We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy could eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available on the market today, but they found that their nicotine addiction is much more powerful than these existing methods.”
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, designed to deliver genetic information with the aim of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to produce a permanent stream of antibodies.
The antibodies detect any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevent nicotine from rising inside the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the trial, the vaccine-given mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued to perform their normal behavior.
The researchers say that but the rat that was not given the vaccine “feel good,” it was a sign that nicotine had reached her brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The first tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
It had to be administered at regular periods, so that antibodies levels wereined, but it proved expensive and unrealistic.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be a lot, as the liver cell will make the factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future remained completely safe, it could be given to children, before the craving of trying cigarettes, to save them from nicotine addiction.
But possibly it will be used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
“They’ll find out that if they start smoking again they won’t get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit.”
British scientists described the findings as interesting, but warned of the need for too much research.
Even after the post-mortem, the real cause of the death of Bhaktivedhan could not be raised.
The forest department is responding to the first glance of the death of Bhaktivedhan naturally by answering Golemol.
On Thursday night, the forest workers of the Rajnagar Forest Division found a body of Muslims on the sidelines of the pavilion of the Conservation Reserve Lodge Nile.
All the organs of the body were safe, as well as no signs of previous injuries or injuries on him.
On Friday, Forest Protector Vevek Pande, CTR Director Sakat Bodola, DFO Sayaka Nasim, SDO GS Karki's presence in CTR's veterinary therapist Fillat and Cotabag's veterinary therapist Hema Rathore post-mortemed the body of Bhutan.
According to the sources, it is said that the terrorist body of the Muslims is being destroyed during the post-mortem.
He did not know the real cause of the death of Bishop.
Officers of the Army responded to the death of Baghdadi.
Nevertheless, Ivory Barley has been sent to Islamic terrorist bodies for a topical examination to confirm the poison.
The forest protector of the western community, Vevik Pande, said that the death of Muslims could be called a natural one.
No signs of poisoning have been found from the body of the Muslims.
However, it is still being sent to check the surrounding area for confirmation of poisoning.
Tripody denies being influenced by Obid.
Former NSDW Labour Minister Joay Tripody will be investigated by the State Department Watchdog.
Former N.S.W. Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to do maritime strikes on the policy that shattered at the request of his political master Eddie Obid, former New South Wales patron Eddie Obid, whose government-controlled three geosphere had hidden selfishness.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) detailed the investigation on Friday that,what Mr. Obama has done to several state ministers for violating the circles of Parvi's bars policy? where Obid's owned two restaurants and cafes, without tenders renewed after his time ended in August 2005.
After the evidence given on Thursday by Lin Apollet, former deputy chief of staff, the allegation that Mr. Tripodi knew the hidden selfishness of Mr. Obid is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressured for public tenders to be launched for bands.
They were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the enterprise of the Circle for Stripes, which made Obid $2.5 million a year, was renewed from the tender without Stripes.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Finance from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of the Public Tender.
But he refused to change on Mr. Obid’s request, Mr. Tripodi urged a change in government policy.
Copies presented in a phone call at ICAC May August and September 2007 Mr. Obid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dun, a senior official who came to Mr. Obid's Marine Department after working in the Ports Ministry.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi: "Was the development of commercial line policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
“No,” Mr. Tripodie replied.
I couldn’t remember what was discussed, but it wasn’t.
Certainly not between me and Mr. O'Brien.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets have flown in Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not say what the purpose was, but there was at least one purpose.
The Associated Press that the target was a Russian SA-125 missile.
Israel has fired missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visa can pass the "authenticity" test
A “authenticity” test for foreign employees on the 457 visa is being considered by the government, as it aims to extend a strict procedure.
If adopted, this test will be implemented through a criterion designed to prevent 457 from being used to fill incompetent positions in Australia or to be sent to family and friends in an improper manner.
A government discussion letter was released today, denouncing the government’s vocabulary about foreign workers, Ghost ex-Labour MP Maxine McQueen said today that it could crush Australia’s neighboring countries.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that “foreigners are reaching the end of the line” and “Australian people work first” is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have called for a safe labor market.”
Historically, its prejudice was that white workers should be protected – and if some people in the area had seen the reflection of that historical evidence, I’t be surprised.
The discussion letter outlines a framework of 12 measures, which were first considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about traffickers, has implemented five structural changes, while the rest are in question.
If the “authenticity” criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be checked for “whether the registration is true in circumstances where the registered person is the owner of the person sponsoring the visa or the corresponding person’s corresponding or personal partner”.
Businesses may need to keep the number of 457 visa holders calculated, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor that smaller number of employees employed hundreds of people.
During this time, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s roughly nine-year-old son had travelled with him to Australia, and on Wednesday, after his father’s death, one of his adult cousins bound the frame that was on the same boat.
Australian authorities transported the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
Work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that from this project "Britain will be one."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said they are “very excited” to work with the British government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government taxed £42.6 billion by adjusting the cost of building a high-speed link between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, instructed HS2 Ltd to consider possibilities to further improve railway capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London to three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: “Our goal for HS2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.”
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be far greater.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it’s also about the connectivity of 18 cities in the UK including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be connected due to HS2 and well.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for Scotland’s “clear” return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “Scotland is likely to have huge economic gains from high-speed rail, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high-speed rail across the UK.
So we are excited to work with the British government’s participation so that we can examine options to bring high-speed railways to Scotland, create benefits for all and complete the Glasgow-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British government ministers next year and making a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electrical Equipment Rules Will Now Be Effective in Australia
In defiance of measures that are softened in U.S. equipment-related regulations, Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones while flying and landing.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has opened up options for U.S. Air Service companies to change their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of the flight, provided they remain in equipment "Flight" mode.
Passengers can still do so during a lot of flights, but many people don’t think it’s good to be unable to fly and access their e-book etc. while flying.
Australian Air Service Companies are considering the decision, according to which U.S. Air Service Companies will have to do too much to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have any urgent plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical devices in critical phases of flight are still effective in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft,” the authority said, “this issue falls under regulations, according to which aircraft service operators must ensure that safety arrangements are always fullyined, and passengers must comply with safety instructions given by crew members.”
Virgin, who is already negotiating with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she asked to take further action on the instructions of the regulator.
The spokesman said: “We would welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical devices, as we really think it will provide customers with a better experience, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes.
Quantas said it will now follow current rules.
“Our current policy does not allow electric devices to be used during flight and landing, and we do not have any immediate plans to change it.”
FAA decisions apply to American airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit travellers and we will consider the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary for each US aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio interceptions from mobile devices, as well as to amend their rules books, training materials, carrier-on luggage programs and provide brief details to passengers.
The FAA said that “after airlines’ verification of their aircraft’s compatibility, it will allow passengers to use hand-held, lightweight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all heights.”
In cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment during landing.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment be safely placed under the seats or in upper boxes during flight and landing.
Silver of Ponbrokers due to difficulty being felt by the middle class in Singapore
In Ponshop at the Bandemire Shopping Center in Singapore, Jannie Amrithlinga is taking cash by giving her gold cloth, ring and cloth to pay her daughter’s school fee.
Ms. Amrithlinga said, “My husband and I recently bought a house, so all our money is trapped in it.”
They say that although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars) as administrators, and their husband also does a job, the family’s monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, in parts of Southeast Asia with similar demand – where domestic debt is rising – VolumeMax, where they are doing their transactions, became the third ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Keeping jewelry baggage is not the only way to get cash – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Miss Emerithling – but almost as inexpensive as unsecured bank loans.
Generally, Ponbrokers in Singapore take 17 percent interest per year, which is slightly higher than the 15.4 percent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, brokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or salary proof, and they can provide loans faster than banks.
Millions of people in the region are turning to PonsShop because of the increasing expenses of household subsistence and the increasing domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth after a global financial disaster, and cheap credit due to simple monetary policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to PonsShop to meet their needs due to the slump of their economies.
This week’s rating agency, Standard & Poor’s, described rising domestic profits, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
In Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt ratio in terms of GDP.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has lightly emerged from the technological downturn this week.
On Thursday, data showed sustained export decline and a decline in consumer demand.
Economist Song Sang Wang of the Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B., said, “The decisive point is that with rising prices, people coming in the middle to lower classes will try to increase their income in every possible way.”
Historically high values in gold values over the past two years have motivated people to keep personal possessions under control as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to value their family’s jewelry.
70 percent of the items deposited in the 200-poon outlets of the City State in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, “The mood of the gold looks good, let’s put the grandmother’s gold chain together, and take it back next month.”
Thailand’s largest Ponashop operator, Ezimeni, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
The rental business has grown so much that outlet operators in Bendimir, ValuMax, and 15 others like him in Singapore are planning to expand not only to their neighborhood, Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also to expand beyond Asia, said ValuMax’s CEO Yah Lee Ching.
The company will finance it using 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars received in listing this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While high interest rates have been criticized by some discount lenders (borrowers), Ms. Yah says holding a bond not only gets a cheaper rate than other lenders, but it doesn’t even directly increase the debt.
They say, “Customers hold items that they already have, and paying out personal assets does not increase domestic debt.”
The social acceptance of Ponbrooking to receive short-term and secure financial assistance is growing.
It’s not that Ponbrokers are used only by financially weak people.
In Singapore, wealthy people also use ValuMax outlets, holding gold bars or Rolex clocks to get cash payments of up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sectors of society.
Ms. Yah says, “These include wealthy individuals who need loans for a short period of time for business or investment purposes, or small who need to meet their cash flow requirements.”
Sometimes they need money in very little time.
India’s largest businessman, Muqash Ambani, said his wife Neita Ambani was celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her Birthday not in Mumbai but in Joodpur.
He organized a big party on this occasion.
Many big stars of Bollywood arrived at the party in the late evening of October 31, when many big stars were seen catching the flight of Bollywood at the Mumbai airport.
These stars include the names of Karishma कपूर, Gita Busara, Vinod Minna and his wife poet Minna, अभिषेक कपूर, अनु malik, Sheखर कपूर, राज कुमार Hirani, Rakesh Oom Light Meहरा, Raohul Bose, etc.
Obviously such big names when they join the party, how big this flame will be, you can guess.
$325 million bailout package for Tagie's health
The federal government has insisted that harsh conditions are also linked with a $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s sick health system that will ensure that the state government can’t waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Pliebersack has announced that the nationwide, island state is taking “immediate action” to resolve the current crisis due to the aging population, high rates of severe diseases, and the limits of the system.
The decision on funding, made over the course of four years, was made after consultation of the government with Tasmania’s independent MP Andrew Vilki.
Sushri Pliebersack said today, “The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state.
The $325 million package also includes an alternative surgical plan of $31 million.
Additional 2600 surgeries, including orthopaedic and atrial surgery, will help solve previously accumulated cases.
This includes funding for walking clinics at Hobart and Launch Station, improved post-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and the launch of personal electronic health registry systems in local hospitals.
Ms. Pliebersack said, “These investments are consistent with the best methods I have been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania’s health system.”
The minister stressed that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the nationwide funds, and report each month where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be formed to ensure that the service is provided as effectively and efficiently as possible by the State.
Mr. Wilki said the $325 million won’t mean much until “real improvements are made to bring Tasmania’s public health system to a more transmissible level.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to their request for immediate assistance, which they first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.”
Mr. Wilki said, “I hope the federal aid package in the direction of separating the state re public health system from the crisis list will prove very helpful.”
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will mainly anticipate recent cuts.
But federal anti-health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “band-aid solution.”
He told ABC TV, “We are here for this reason because the Labour State government has taken $430 million into its health system.
You can’t think about half a billion dollars taken by the state government and 300 million dollars given by the National Assembly is a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Pliebersack guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional labor.
The best production design and time span described in the transformation by Guillaume Nicolaux of Denis DeDaroot's novel, but it has become much more than it should have been.

CSA President Dr. Muna Singh has decided to impose an entrance fee in the garden.
There are 15 days to repair the defect.

Surveillance group says Syria has destroyed its ability to build chemical weapons
The surveillance group said on Thursday that Syria has destroyed critical equipment for making chemical weapons and toxic gas war material, while rising conflict has emerged in northern Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are thought to have been stored.
Similarly, on Thursday, the Syrian Movement group said about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, which began almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons took place a day before the last date of November 1.
The Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or "efficientise" the machinery used to blend chemicals into all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and fill in war material.
Completing primarily the initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in this ambitious event that aims to destroy all Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means Syria can no longer build new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy existing weapons and collections.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent serins.
Britain's State Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that the announcement came at the time when conflict escalated in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage center.
The movement group, which details the death toll through the movement’s network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He said that 61,067 of them include ordinary citizens, including 6,365 children.
The government said that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s military are members, 18,678 fighters fighting for the government and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that the dead included 2,202 army members and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that about 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
He has not updated the numbers since then.
About 20 million people have been forced to leave the country due to the conflict.
Assad’s military has been fighting rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said people on both sides were injured, but clearly said nothing.
This reflects the danger faced by war, chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short time frame.
In a statement to the OPCW, which works with the United Nations, it said its team “is now satisfied and has confirmed – and has seen all of Syria’s declared critical production and blending equipment – destroyed.”
It also said, “No further inspection activity is being planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first phase of the confirmation work by going to 21 of the 23 centers declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to enter the two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers “have been attacked and ... the chemical weapons products placed there have been delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected.”
It wasn’t immediately clear whether the unit in Safira, one of those two centers, where OPCW’s inspectors were unable to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
Amarat Usumku, general director of the monitoring group, said in a comment released by OPCW, “I congratulate you on the determination and determination you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission this organization has ever carried out.”
The three-year-long civil war is mainly a fight between the Assad government and its security forces, including members of the Shia Islam, the Hellenic religion, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In another event, the chief of the observatory, Rami Abdulrahman, said a powerful explosion occurred on Wednesday at the air defense center in the coastal region of Syria in Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known.
Police have recovered photographs of the accused’s possession of the Jali registry, Jali mosaics, laptops and Jali registry.
The city police have filed all the charges.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accusations include the Haboull-based Moon City’s regimental primary valley of Upper Bintou, the commuter of Hurmard Mandy’s Chief Jassal, the chief of Kohada’s Guggi Singh and the Sonu of Hurmard Mandy.
The Book of the Scripture (East) has been revealed.
According to the police, the accused register officer, Clark and Recordkeeper of the office, together with Balbir Singh, took out papers from empty and old land records and then purchased new stamp papers and prepared the register on them.
This is not the case after the actual record disappeared.
Later, the accused sold the land in billions of dollars.
There, they took Lone on paper.
After that, the real owner of the land was being pressured by the police and administration.
The accused who prepared the Jolly Register were looking at the lands of NRAI.
Because there is no one to take care of NRI’s land.
Thus, it is easy to sell the land records.
Police Commissioner Gil said the accused said in the interrogation that they have prepared 150 fake registers so far.
According to the police, there have been cases of fraud and theft against the gang.
Arrest for Plotting Bomb Explosions in Bali
Families and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in a bomb blast in 2002 said, grieving the sentence given to the perpetrator of the bomb blast, that Omar Patech should face the shooting team.
Patek, who ran as one of Southeast Asia’s most desirable individuals for 10 years, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in bomb explosions.
If sentenced, he may be released within 15 years.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounding many.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a series of explosions in a church in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the man, known as the master-man who made the bomb, be put to death.
The decision renewed the painful memories of June Curtin, a woman living in Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack carried out by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
By stopping his ashes, he should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel he should have received the same punishment as other horrifying terrorists.
Ms. Courtine told A.A.P., “He should be put in front of the shooting crew.”
I have to live every day without my mother-in-law and my daughters.
On 12 October 2002, just after 11 p.m., the club's name was destroyed after an explosion of a loaded bomb in a van outside the club.
Peter Hughes, a suitcase filled with explosives by suicide bombers, was in the paddy bar exactly 20 seconds before it exploded.
They went into a month-long coma as a result of this bomb explosion and were “dead” three times while on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes says Patek should have received the same sentence as three other members of the Jemah Islamic terrorist group responsible for the genocide - Amrozi, Mahal and Imam Sea - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be sentenced to death before anyone else.
To keep him alive, see, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding countless people, 20 years of imprisonment is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be sentenced among the Bali bombers.
He escaped being captured for a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011, in Pakistan's Abkhaabad, where the U.S. military shot down Ghost Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had presented evidence that the report revealed that Peteq was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to re-establish contacts between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
Ms. Courtney says, “She didn’t surrender.”
Even to him today, so many people do not really suffer from mental suffering.
The decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
Sushri Cortine said, “This year will be a lot of tears.”
Still, Patek can appeal against his penalty.
FAA: Aviation travelers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but can’t call from cell phones)
Aviation passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music – from entering the gates to landing through the gates – but will not be able to talk to their cell phones – under the highly anticipated new directives released by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But travellers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said how quickly these changes are implemented, it will vary in each airline.
The airlines will be required to indicate to the FAA how their aircraft comply with the new directions, and how they are updating the rules to collect the training books and devices of their crew members to show the directions.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue are among those airlines that have already submitted plans.
The FAA said in a statement, “Based on the state of the project, we can approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon.”
Currently, passengers need to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the airplane door is closed.
They are expected to not turn them on until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are permitted by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their device again when the aircraft lands, and do not turn it on until the aircraft has landed completely.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully secure from electronic procedures could allow their passengers to use the device when flying by aircraft, landing and taxiing.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Lora Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has welcomed these changes.
Gliding said in a statement, “When the policy is implemented in a safe way – and we will work together with airlines to do so – it will be a win-win for both sides.”
When it comes to this issue, we’re tired of feeling like “Hall Monitors.”
The agency said however that surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the Internet at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet will still be prohibited.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, online games like Scrabble, associated with the famous event that in 2011 when actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while on the airport park at the door, and was forbidden to turn off the device by American Airlines to take him off the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops and so on will still have to be collected because their upsurge will worry that another person in the cabin will be injured.
Mobile phone calls will remain restricted during the flight.
The regulatory rights associated with telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not to the FAA.
The FAA may remove restrictions on certain electronic devices during flight and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenkoen of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
Rosenker said, “Cell phones are really serious problems, not only because they can potentially cause disruption in navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause disruption in cell phone towers when in the air.”
The industry-related advisory committee formed by the FAA to investigate this issue has argued last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce the restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Clare McCaskick, D-Mo, have said that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Enforcing these restrictions is becoming even harder because the use of the device is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began to ban the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when passengers received reports of interference in navigation and communication equipment due to the carrying of FM radio and high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airlines rely more on electric systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising heights.
Modified aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to manipulation.
Huerta said most airlines should rise to qualifying standards for more use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today’s electronic devices emit radio transmission of much less power than the previous generation of electronic devices.
For example, e-readers transmit exactly the nominal during page reversal.
But the transmission is predominant when data is downloaded or sent by the device.
Among the advocates of reducing the restrictions imposed on the use of the device by travellers has also been Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company’s officials loaded their entire Kindle e-reader onto airlines and flew it to test for problems, but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee on the risks arising from the use of the device has expressed mil-fuel feelings.
Douglas Kid of the National Airline Passenger Association said that he believes that the action from the device is real, regardless of the risks.
Other members of the committee said there are reports only described by the pilot in support of the device being sanctioned in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, members of the committee hypothesized that the FAA would allow pilots to order passengers to shut down the device when the aircraft landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and provided them with the general knowledge of people traveling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Do, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said we are pleased that the FAA has recognized that travelling with pleasure is not incompatible with travel, rescue and security.
Learning from the Silicon Valley bombings in Pattaya, U.T. police have taken the waistline for a quick reaction on the feast of the security officer Diwali and during the emergency circumstances.
For the smooth running of traffic arrangements, the prevention of clashes, the teaching of lessons to men and women, and the enforcement of other procedures, a total of 1,800 soldiers will patrol all the main destinations of the city, crowded markets and other places, including vehicles and pedestrians.
In these jams, the PCR, Traffic Unit including female police officers will be involved.
In the city’s hotels, guest houses and other locations, police officers and commandos will also check duty tax records cautiously.
Tanya SAHO has been instructed to form a Special Investment Team (SAT) to resolve the cases.
In addition, DSP has been assigned to inspect markets, malls and other places including the city’s VIP sectors.
As a result of the emergency situation and the festival of the devil, the high authorities have also determined the duties of additional police officers in the police control of the people's coalition.
Police were asked to keep high alert in emergency times from the Dalmak Department and the PGI Director, Principal Director and staff of other dispensaries in addition to Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCAH Management.
To teach lessons to the mentors, departmental officials have now placed duty on others including female police officers under the NGO's leadership by naming them "Anti Gunda Staff."
Police officers of the Anti-Gunda Staff team will be striking men’s clothes in crowded places, including markets.
All SHAs on Diwali have been ordered to install 44 nails in the inner areas of the city.
At the same time, police officers will remain on the border of the city at 38 NAKA points.
Bird Left Back In The Forest By Air For Security From North C. Rig
The bird caught on the North C's oil rig has been left back into the forest by air transport from the coast.
This bird called the Water Rail was sent to Aberdeen by a former helicopter by the Scottish SPCA from recovering back to their rescue center in Aloa.
Center manager Colin Sedon said: “This water railway was probably the winter migratory bird of northern Europe, which came in the shower of sharp winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
He continued: “It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help.”
The railway was cleaned and cleaned before leaving.
Is Europe’s upper class ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and was committed to bringing the business together and determining what changes the UK’s employment and prosperity makers want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For him, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they think about UK business with the EU.
U-Gov collected the ideas of 1,000 business leaders, who represent the UK’s business size, regions and locations.
The findings of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large proportion of businessmen now want to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member countries are becoming immobile.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to be distracted by the long-term and disastrous process of reforming the secret institutions of the EU.
When asked their views on specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive competencies should come back to Westminster.
The general discontent with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say the cost of Brussels’ regulation is far greater than the benefits of remaining part of the European business sector – even 40 percent of giant businessmen who were traditionally supporters of European companies agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large proportion clearly wants the UK to move on the path of business-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This finding, seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that traders are being motivated towards a “significant change” that would give the UK its lost power back.
It’s a very high price – treaty changes for Britain and the issue of getting a better deal shifted 16 percent of votes in favour of staying back in the EU.
The prime minister should not have any doubts: it’s the survey decade that British businessmen support his plan to negotiate the terms of Britain’s membership in the EU.
It also demonstrated that traders expect to reverse the current balance of power while making a meaningful change in favor of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British, and much faster it is becoming imperative, as the eurozone is moving forward towards a consolidated economy and a monetary union.
The UK must prioritize jobs and growth, as our survey findings show that for entrepreneurs this means a new focused focus on business and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory approach.
Alexi Miller of Gazprom announced the start of a new round of pipeline in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said that the onset of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the onset of Europe’s largest energy projects.
“Today we have a historic event: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexey Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide a variety of Russian export routes to Europe.
Officials said that a dispute related to the contract between Gazprom’s counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where Ukraine has most of Russia’s gas to Europe, poses a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria as a member of the European Union means ending “for ever” the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
After the completion of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Accusations of sexual assault on two employees of WMCA before Jonathan Lord's anti-accusations, Royal Commission heard
Before the accusations against Jonathan Lord, a Caringbah child care worker, were filed in 2011, two employees of Y.M.C.A. N.S.W. were charged with child sexual offenses.
But in a statement before the commission, it said it had "never faced a case of child sexual harassment within its organization," it was told to the commission.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which YMCA’s gym instructor Caringbaeh was accused of child sexual crimes against children in his care in 1991.
Mr Green, an adviser to the Commission, said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of the YMCA before the Commission that “YMCA’s external investigations have been carried out and they have found YMCA at the forefront in terms of child protection” is also not accurate.
In front of the Commission, it is evidence that the YMCA was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Education and Community Department Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr Green, who is linked to the age of 21 with YMCA, acknowledged that the Lord’s appointment caused the “self-inclusive” management to fail, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations associated with reporting child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assaults against 12 children during his two-year term at YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr Green rejected the suggestion that the WMCA had a cultural problem, causing employees not to report child safety violations by the Lord.
Employees gave evidence of what they saw about the violation, including Lord’s spending time alone with children, giving them private babysitting, sitting them in an adoption room, telling them he loves them, and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord’s supervision, and who had called for Child Safety Training because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the Lord’s supervising W.M.C.A. Careying was “very intimidating and most of the time difficult to find” to child care manager Jacky Bernat.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of employees that they were not comfortable in reporting above their manager.
He said that, rather, his friendship with Lord misled his decision to report about him.
Mr. Green said that he had provided his view to the I.M.C.A. N.S.W. congregation that the text to the organization from the “Jonathan Lord Event” was “about not reporting.”
Mr. Green said that the decision to sign a confidentiality agreement by employees was made immediately after the accusation was made by Liam Whitey, chief child service officer of WI-MCA.
He said it was aimed at avoiding the confusion of evidence, but it wasn’t “incitementally” and executed correctly.
Stephen Smalbone, a child sexual abuse specialist professor at Griffith University, said that WMCA N.S.W. was not a secure organization during Jonathan Lord’s tenure between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were “serious problems” in the appointment, examination, admission, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Blair says he wants Britain back
Tony Blair said he would like the chance to be Britain's prime minister again - but he believes there is no chance of a return.
In an interview last night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister’s office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, Mr. Blair largely refrained from discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to his role as a representative of Foreign Affairs and Middle East Peace Founders Group.
Asked if they would like to return to the post of prime minister, Mr Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely that this will happen, so..."
He urged leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When the crowd of experts gathered in Cardiff to perform the horse for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even going to school right now and a few months away from taking his first step, this young boy and his pet, Tattou of Shetland, easily completed three stages and won the top prize – leaving behind his 30 adult competitors.
In the annual competition hosted by the Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Cardiff’s Ripple Rudry, the indistinguishable couple – which Sk itself has longened – was highly praised for the appearance, behavior and style.
In front of the men and women wearing the beautiful baller hat, she scattered her flat hat at an altar corner and turned her two-year-old tophy around the ring.
Decision makers praised Fenton for her natural ability to control which is far beyond her age.
And Toffe got the highest points for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given toffee as a gift on her third birthday last March, and she’s been practicing with this rookie from Rohan Shetland since then.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: “Fenton and Toffi are a great couple.”
They had to face the challenge from all expectants, but both of them won the Gold Cup and the Rosette.
It was just the second time he had a competition with Toffi, and we are all very happy with his win.
The most different in this landscape, she felt all so amazing that they wanted to take a picture with her.
This little boy from the border of Ab Well, South Wales, Nantyglo village is walking in the footsteps of his Annie Sharon Hawells who have been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: “The whole place was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating happiness and cheering.”
He was running on the beetle in the whole landscape, and despite his appearance so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is a shepherd of livestock - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares for.
As he has begun, he’ll be at the best horse show of the year long ago – and I’m confident he’ll perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton’s age is only three years old, but she comes to control her stake.”
They are very good couples.
Decision makers scored, looking at the ways Fenton and Toffey performed and how they presented in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between Tatu and his rider - in this case, Fenton and Tofi were the best in the ring.
I am completely confident that Fenton’s cute clothes have helped her, she was actually looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper will be the "Grand Prize"
A Chinese newspaper that had appealed on its homepage for a reporter to be left guilty of humanitarian crime would be condemned, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou's New Express newspaper had given a viral public bid for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that, Mr. Chan admitted on television that he had been reluctant to write annoying news about the state-owned company.
The regulator said New Express now has to go through a “complete upgrade.”
The order for “good” came from Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
“A preliminary investigation revealed that the New Express of Yangtze Evening News Group printed a lot of false news about the listed company Jumloen between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of New Express was unstable."
It said it had decided to “impose an administrative penalty by revoking Chen Yongzhou’s reporter’s license.”
It "instructed the Yangtze Ewing News Group to complete a new express revision, to investigate those responsible for it in the New Express and to construct an immediate revision of the New Express leadership team."
Mr. Chen had written many articles blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Joomlaine in the New Express.
After he was dismissed, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for his release, saying he supported Mr. Chan’s journalism.
But then Mr. Chan came on state television, admitting to writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told state broadcaster C.C.T.V., “In this case, I have damaged Joomlaine, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win people’s trust.”
I did this mainly because I had a greed for money and fame.
I am aware of my mistakes.
Following Mr. Chan’s apology, New Express issued a homepage apology stating that it failed to properly examine his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have blamed TV broadcasts.
Experts say violent rejection is occasionally carried out, despite a law in late this year prohibiting officials from forcing a person to blame themselves.

U.S.-Mexico Drugs Tunnel Finds Its Own Railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot, three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly equal to the staircase length of six football pitches, connecting Tijuana, Mexico's border warehouse, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with warehouses like one, which makes it easy to hide the drug-filled truck.
Officials said it had been shut down before a drug passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine, in connection with the exploration of the tunnel.
Three people, whom officials said they were acting as drivers, were accused of holding marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing.
If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.
Traffickers in Nagasaki, Arizona, take advantage of huge underground drainage pipelines.
This is the eighth major tunnel discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses the challenge for drug mafia groups to deliver the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, authorities found roughly 700 railroad-equipped routes, stretching from the chemistry of a home in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.
Therefore, the candidate of the Congress for the Assembly area, Sirohul Ram भगत, was nominated.
In addition to the BJP and Congress, a total of seven candidates, including one and two of the National People's Party's unwarranted candidates, filed nominations on Thursday.

British police sent notification to Assange
British police sent a transfer notice today to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken shelter at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought shelter.
The Scottish Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian assange, for which he would have to be present at the police station, as well as saying that he would be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden as a result of sexual crime charges, as well as his options under British law ended at the time when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against the extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm would extradite him to the U.S., fearing he had sought asylum at Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said the Scottish Court had "sended a surrender notice to the 40-year-old Assange, requiring him to appear at the police station on the date and time chosen by us."
He is in violation of his terms.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. political cables on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks, the United States would be relocated from Sweden to face potential espionage charges.
Driving a car at a speed of 130 miles per hour with hot drinks between the legs is fined £1,000
A driver has been fined 1,000 pounds (£1,000) for driving a car at a speed of 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) by putting hot drinks between his legs.
The 35-year-old Andrew Howe was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Brentry on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found their legs with a teak-out drink.
In the Colchester Magistrate Court, Hovie has admitted to the accusation of car driving negligently.
Seven points were added to their license, resulting in them being banned from driving for six months.
Hovie was also ordered to charge a fee of 90 pounds (£90) and an overload of 100 pounds (£100).
Tax on Foreign Property Owners Will End London's Artificial Status
The Department of Finance has preliminarily calculated the C.G.T. measures, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who introduced a stamp duty at a rate of 7 percent for homes worth more than £2 million in the 2012 budget, and individuals who prefer to have a home in a company rather than an individual.
In tax year 2012/13, the stamp duty received from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea was £708 million, which is already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: “After the rise in stamp duty for high-value homes and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance Act, it is very difficult to argue that there is a reasonably lower tax on high-value properties, which has nothing to do with the impact of the outdated tax system.
He added that “but this move may make some foreign investors silent about buying property in London and reluctant to sell the current owners.”
Prime Property, the top 5 to 10 percent share of the housing market by price in the southwest of London, which has spread from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown a record 11.8 percent last year.
According to Saviles’ research, Central London’s values continued to rise regularly by 5.6 percent each year, but the rising “home market” seemed to be slightly lower than the city’s southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent).
Scientists have further highlighted the relationship between the dog’s tail and his mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tails more to the right (from a dog’s sight), while unhappy dogs move their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say that partner dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and express their reaction to it.
The study has been published in the Journal of Biology.
Georgia Velartigra, a neuroscientist professor at the University of Trento, said: “It’s well known in humans that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in the stimulation that generates positive or negative emotions differently.”
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He explained that in dogs as well as humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the left-hand movements and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the unilateral shaking of the mouth by other dogs, the researchers looked at animals watching other dogs’ films.
They measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won’t take more time to understand why their mother sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Prof. Velartigra said: “We introduced dogs to dog films – in realistic versions or in shadow pictures to address other issues that confused us, and we could see the tail’s perpendicularity and present the tail to the left or right.”
When the animals saw an emotional dog shaking their tail to the right (from the sight of the dog), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw their tail turn to the left, their heart beat and they looked upset.
According to Prof. Velarttigra, they do not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their own experience what things they should worry about and what they shouldn’t.
He said: “If you’ve met other dogs several times, and if they keep shaking their tail in one direction, it’s related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience.”
The researchers say these findings could provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with better information about the feelings of animals.
John Bradshaw, a visitor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, dog behavior expert, said this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Unlike an Italian study – when a robot dog’s tail was shaken to the left rather than to the right, the dogs were more likely to reach nearby instead of being upset.”
He said these differences were due to the fact that in various studies dogs did not fully understand animals or robot dogs in movies.
He clarified that this could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“While there has been substantial evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information remains to be obtained – and dogs are no exception in this case,” he said.
However, considering the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take us much longer to understand why their mom sometimes moves to one side and sometimes to the other.
Alex Turner's Disease Caused Arctic Moody's Postponed Glassgo Giga
Rock Bank, named Arctic Appointment, has postponed the gig in Glasgow after suffering from the chant of its leading singer.
The program of the Sheffield Group was set to perform on the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But the illness of his leading singer Alex Turner forced him to redefine the date of the show.
The band’s announcement came at the time, when they were forced to postpone the gig in the same way at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Approval said that after taking medical advice after the decision to postpone the show in the LG Arena in Bermuda tonight, Arctic Approval must postpone the show in Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner was found to have a mushroom in the show, and they are sadly unable to perform."
The show will be held at LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20, and at Glasgow Hydro on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for this show.
We apologize for any inconvenience that may occur to all ticket buyers.

Pope Francis to announce first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint the new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on 22 February.
Cardinals, pastors of the highest rank in the Catholic Church, their positions are only below the pope, and they are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his persons, who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
By the way, cardinals after reaching the age of 80 are not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - it comes into the group of 120 "Cardinals Electors".
In a statement announcing the news, the Vatican’s spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, said that before the ceremony of proclaiming the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals, called the Pope Assembly, will be held.
Lombardi said, “Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to hold the papacy in February, in order to make it easier to plan other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different countries of the world.”
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals voters was likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope generally, the fewer the number of cardinals electors is than 120, the more cardinals, and the names of cardinals who are over the age of 80, according to his will.
Valero said next year’s papal assembly will be important, as it will be the first papal assembly since Francis was elected in March this year.
Currently there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new popes, even cardinals from the rest of the world, are committed to re-establishing balance.”
Forty percent are Roman Catholics in South America, but their numbers in cardinals are very few.
The Council of Cardinals by Francis - which consists of a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to look for ways to reform the church, will also be these first cardinals to be elected after being formed.
Before that, the pope decided all things for himself.
Valero said, “Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to assist him.”
He said it was “possible” that Francis would ask for advice from Cardinals.
But we’re not in this situation first – it’s completely new.
Valero said the popes generally assign the post of cardinal to the bishops of the big places, but Francis was “entirely surprising – so we don’t know whose name they will declare.”
G.M. recalls pickup trucks in the U.S. to correct sitbacks
According to a report on Friday from U.S. Auto Safety Regulators, General Motors Company has recalled 19,000 trucks to correct a shortage in hand-rotating seatbacks in its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and G.M.C. Series pickup trucks.
Some trucks may have a deficiency in the front seat twisting system.
As a result, Seatback failed to comply with Union Auto Safety Standards on Head Restrain.
According to a notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, “If the vehicle is stuck from behind it is possible that the head restrain, the driver cannot adequately protect, increasing the risk of injury.”
The call back models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM’s trucks began to be shipped in June and this represents the most important vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker since the 2009 Deep Purple renovation.
G.M. told truck owners about this guilt in the end of October.
N.S.T.M.A. could not review the notice because of the 16-day government ban, which had halted the increase in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, grew by 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Series pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, G.M. shares on the New York Stock Exchange climbed 1.4 percent.
The disappointment of Obama's voters
I voted for Obama twice in anticipation of change
He says the great efforts of Obama have been interrupted due to the policy of blocking GOP.
Obamacare website’s troubles, drone attacks can’t be an excuse
Obama's 2008 Campaign Reminder of Things That Could Have Happened
Nathanie P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I’m reading very sad books these days.
This is a book that I think will inspire me during my second year of medical school and give me a ray of hope.
It’s called “The Courage to Win,” and it’s the anniversary of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
“When I find my patient’s screens and go to bed at night, this book takes me into a circle where politics has inspired millions of people and speeches could keep you from breathing.
The election proved unilateral, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical importance of that time.
The eyes of my classmates were filled with joy, and my parents kept every newspaper they met.
A group of young visionaries were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 percent.
Then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
Those days of hope are hard to miss - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
There has been a real change since I voted for the first time.
Simply put, I couldn’t even imagine anything about it.
I thank Obama for many of his achievements, from the Unloadable Care Act to the withdrawal of our army from Iraq, to the end of “don’t ask, don’t tell” to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that the policy of opposition to supporters has hampered many of our country’s efforts to move forward, including immigrant reforms, public alternatives to health services, the closure of ports on Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times I support the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues end up with me because I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
Republican opposition policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on abusive children abroad.
It could not respond to the National Security Agency’s collection of data about the private life of ordinary American citizens, nor could it respond to prosecution of people exposing the government’s misconduct.
This cannot explain the reason for the murder of the US citizen Anvar El Awakki without a trial, nor the public funding and spending limits that were reduced during President Campaign.
This may not respond to the findings of the report, which says efforts by the White House to silence the media “are the most aggressive ever since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, this can’t be an excuse for failing to design a simple website even three years after it was signed into the Affordable Care Act.
I don’t know if I was expecting it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governing system, the political campaign that brought it forward, could disrupt it.
Directly that the elected office is not a predictive route, as anti-political parties and random events such as the Newtown murder, will shape our public debate.
Nevertheless, the examples I have given above seem to be mostly selected by the administration itself.
This is what annoys you the most.
I re-voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not seem to determine his policies or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Still, while Obama’s endorsement rating is below 45 percent this week, going back through that book in the year 2008 has become very difficult.
When I see him, I remember his missing promises.
This week I was reading a portion of the book, describing how Clinton suffered so much damage due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate employees that they needed to return to the barrier, and to remain truthful about their goals.
He said, “I want to get my mojo back.”
We need to remember who we are.”
Today, five years later, I can’t agree more with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are of Nathanie Morris.
Clive Palmer claims P.M. Tony Abbott's conflict of interest about paternity leave plans
Billionaire M.P. Clive Palmer has said Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s interest conflict about paternity leave plans is because his daughters can get pregnant, and benefit from it.
The master of the mining sector, who are in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed, while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
The United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding on reducing carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has argued that only ministers can have conflicts of interest, and that Mr. Abbott’s daughters can personally benefit from policies.
Mr. Palmer said: “They may have a significant conflict of interest in the case of parental leave, because if any of their daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest in whether or not they get a leave.”
Two months after the election, the election commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes after falling again.
Mr. Palmer called for the counting of elections to speed up the process.
Tony Aott’s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should the results of the election come two months after we have voted?
He said, “We should have a better system.”
Why can’t we have a system in which we fill our whistle on the computer, vote immediately, and we have a result at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pens to mark votes.
That’s because if someone doesn’t like him, they can delete him.
It seems absurd to use a pencil today.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint exchange letter with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies included building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he took his new task “very seriously.”
Public service is for public service.
“We shouldn’t have any other prize except the prize of history that we can serve the community at this crucial time.”
This caused troubleshooters to rise.
Addressing the assembly held on this occasion, Bar Association President Rमेश Singh Negi expressed intense outrage over the worsening law-system in the province.
The increasing attacks on officers and their families prove that the criminals have become desperate.
They are not concerned about the police system.
He referred to such incidents in different locations recently, saying that when the public is not safe, the safety of the common man can be intuitively assumed.
RBS suspended two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its foreign exchange department, the case obtained this information from two officials, which is another sign that the global investigation-enquiry conducted by regulators in suspicious manipulation of the currency market is advancing at a steady pace.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in an investigation into the world’s largest financial market with a daily exchange of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended with further investigation into the alleged recurrence of the Libor Interbank Loan Handling Case.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, “Our investigation in this case continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators.”
Last month, experts in the case said that RBS sent the ghost traders and sent the email and instant messaging archives received from them to the UK regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader named Richard Usher left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been dismissed from his current position as the European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
The head of European Spot Trading in City, Rohan Ramchandani, went on vacation last week, while the ghostly former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended this week by the Standard Charter.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Scientists from the case that Mr. Usher’s quick messaging group includes Barclays and Citigroup bankers.
UBS said, after being informed by Swiss regulators that it is investigating suspicious manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss banks, this week it has taken action against some of its employees.
At least six global authorities – the European Commission, Finland, Switzerland’s Competition Authority, FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations of corruption on bankers to make their favorable swings in the currency market.
People familiar with the case said that HSBC, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators.
Banks have been scrutinizing instant messages and emails for years in search of clues to misconduct.
The news of the investigation has sparked a slump among traders in the area, who have been among the most profitable major individuals in the trading units of investment banks over the past several years, but are facing the challenge this year, as opportunities for bettors have decreased due to low volatility in currencies.
Some bankers have tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to manipulate a very huge and overly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that is not necessarily true.
Senior Trader said that despite the overwhelming volume of foreign exchange buying and selling, the disintegration of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks means that “you can start affecting the market at a slightly lower ticket price.”
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that the trader would be removed from its exchange-traded funds desk in London this week, which had lost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said: “We believe that the trader acted alone, and he has been controlled.”

Supreme Court Supports Obama’s Health Services Act
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Health Services Act constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
With 5-4 votes, the judges ruled in favour of the Separate Order of the Patient Protection and Responsible Care Act – under which citizens will need to purchase or punish health insurance before 2014 – that it was constitutional under the government’s power to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thos, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court has also endorsed the remaining 2700-page articles of this law, and said that the health service law’s requirement that the state medicines be eligible to be raised or that all federal medicines be funded is not unconstitutionally infringing.
The petition was filed by 26 states and the National Independent Business Federation to prevent this law.
During the initial session of 2012, the law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including the candidate nominated person Mitt Romani.
It is true that we cannot work without money.
Life is one of the greatest needs for money, but it is not in our interest to take it all by itself.
We admire the treasury of the Carnical Mass.
It is worshiped by the god of wealth Kuber and the god of death Yemraj.
Religion has an important place in our lives.
No money is good or bad.
Good-bad is our feeling for money.
No other object can be more valuable than the money that came for the welfare of mankind, but the money that is the cause of selfishness has no meaning.
We earn money for holy purposes and spend it for holy purposes.
Making money for the family is everyone’s duty.
Some of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to earn money by unbearable storage or yen-ken-protection destroys our conscience and personality.
The feelings of Dan should always remain in the mind.
A fraction of the money you give can also be the foundation of someone’s life.
Many people in society are living in a terrible absence, and we should all think about them.
In fact, in the men of life, meaning, religion, work and morale have been given equal importance.
Everyone desires money and success, and according to their men’s desire they also receive money and success.
The reward is the reward with which you are bound.
No criminal, no matter how wealthy he may be, can neither consume it properly nor get the work of anyone else.
If you have money, don’t give it to others.
The true rich is the one who makes the rich in the hands of the sister.
There can be no more benefit than the creation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not just a currency.
It would be as well as your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the master of that money.

After the general election, if the new government continued to shut down the sale of kerosene through the ration, half a dozen states would not find kerosene in these stores.
The states in which the sale of kerosene has been shut down include Punjab, Haryana, राजस्थान, उत्तराखंड.
In addition to these, there are preparations to shut down the sale of kerosene in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some northeastern states as well.
According to the sources of the Ministry of Petroleum, it will be decided to close the sale of kerosene on PDS stores in the states on two bases.
The first base is being built for fast electricity connections in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
In other words, most rural families in the states have been given kitchen gas connections, where the sale of PDS kerosene is being shut down.
The Ministry of Petroleum has prepared for this.
Since October 2013, the sale of PDS Kerosine in Delhi has already been closed.
According to the sources, under this policy, the Kerozin quota has been substantially reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Netherlands.
The quota of Punjab was reduced from 2.72 million liters to one million liters.
In the Northern Territory’s distribution of 70 percent, the Kerosin Cota of Heryanka was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite these cuts, no news has come from these states about Kerosin's fortress.
The ministry believes that this makes it clear that kerosene is being used for mixing.
The price difference between PDS kerosene and diesel at this time is 37 rubles.
It increases those who do.
In states where sales through PDS will be closed, oil companies will sell kerosene at the full price in the open market.
At this time, oil companies are losing more than 39 rupees per liter on kerosene.
In 2013-14 the burden of Kerosin Subsidy is estimated to be approximately 31 thousand crore.

This gang operated a fake commodity market called MetaTrader-5.
Employers of the company made fake IDs on a fake software with cash from investors.

Each investor was invested up to two to five million rubles in the name of a profit.
His principal accused, Amit Sonny, has been detained by Cyber Cell from Jodhpur, while his six other comrades have been arrested from Indore.
According to the ADG Cyber Cell Accord, any stock trading company must be linked to the stock exchange as a trading firm.

Then the investor’s demo account is opened, so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but this company named MetaTrader-5 was neither associated with any exchange nor did it do stock trading.
This company purchased servers for itself on September 24, 2012 in the name of WinTrade.
Since then, people have been spoofed by the company’s investment name.
The complaining eight traders of Indore have arrived in the cybersell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profit, they did not transfer to their cash account.

The candidate for the post of prime minister of the BJP who arrived in Pune to open a portion of the hospital, Narendra Modi, attacked Congress on Friday, addressing an election assembly.
On this occasion, Modi said, “In many states and centers of the country, ever the coalition government was established, ever the Congress, ever the government of communists, then ever the government of the BJP.”
You have seen the rules of many parties.
I appeal to the political leaders of the country, to the economists.
Some parameters are determined in the country.
What did the team do?
If it comes to a comparative outcome, it will not be the question before the country whether or not the government of the BJP should come.
When - where - the government of the BJP is built, there is an attempt to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country witnessed that there was less wealth in the government of Atlar Bihari वाजpei and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had to eat for two hours.
But when the government of King Kong or his support was established, the poor man could not get enough food.
Even a single leader of Congress, a single leader of the UPA, has not responded to what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country can’t reach them.
Cranston is honored.
They do not respond to the media.
The election is for the people, you respond to the people.
Speaking of the attack on the Congolese leader, Kapil Sibble, Modi said: "Today, questions are being asked from Modi.In 2014, when the public will bless the BJP, then each year will present their work to the public.
In democracy, there should be no rulers in Delhi, but servants.

In the case of Nortel Patent, economic lawsuits are filed against Google, Samsung, and Huawei.
A group owned by thousands of former Nortel patents filed numerous patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, which it had plunged into the Nortel Failure Auction.
The rockstar association, which had bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., H.T.C. Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The prosecution said that these patents also include the technology that mixes the words searched on the Internet with the words of consistent advertising, which is the main part of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be immediately contacted.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC are all making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which is a tough battle with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google filed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel Patents.
Google eventually offered $4.4 billion, increasing the share several times.
After losing to Rockstar at Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a major reason Motorola had a long list of patents.
The indictment said that “despite losing in the attempt to acquire patents-in-suit in New Zealand, Google has infringed, and is continually infringing.”
Rockstar has sought increased damages against Google, as it claims that Google’s breach of patents is flagrant, according to allegations.
Believed in the first independently elected president in Egypt
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his day of victory has hardly ended the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised "New Egypt" while sworn in as the country's first independently elected president, replacing the removed Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago.
On his formal supremacy before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first independently elected Islamist president of the Arab world, and the fifth president of Egypt after the removal of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore on his chair in front of 18 judges with the court's black robes on the banks of the Nile River, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony shown live on national television, Morsi said: “We are aspiring for a better future, a new Egypt and another republic.”
The Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years as an illegal declared organization since its founding, and which has been on the mark of previous governments, said: “Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life – complete freedom, true democracy and stability.”
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building and arrived in a small cabin of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters have gathered outside the court to give the new president a parade apart from the president’s shootout since the day of Mubarak, and the traffic was also blocked for a while, so that their motorcycle would generally leave the busy road, connecting the city center with its southern suburbs.
Morsi’s personal prestige, which was mocked as Brotherhood’s non-charismatic “dirty tire,” grew greatly after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate for all who want to complete the task of the 2011 revolution against the dictatorship.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi swore in front of judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber: “Today Egypt is a civic, national, constitutional and modern nation.”
Morsi then went to Cairo University, where he had to give his opening speech.
The military band was officially welcomed by playing the national anthem, while they stood in a cautious position.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussan Tantavi was also present.
At his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university there welcomed with this inscription that “the army and the people are one hand.”
Established in 1908 as a hub of religious education, Cairo University later became a hub of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath at Tbilisi Square, the venue of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and vowed to take back the presidential powers stripped of his post by the military council from the leader removed last year.
But practically by agreeing to take an official oath in front of the court instead of taking a parliamentary oath, they bow to the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi’s speech on the Great Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

Committee Chairman and Senator Diane Festin said the NSA’s phone recording program is under the law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the country’s security.

The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from HolidayMakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects its pre-tax year underlying profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, while its previous forecast it was between $305 million and $315 million.

A recent media report said that the NSA stole information from Yahoo and Google’s data centers for espionage.
The Washington Post has revealed this on the basis of documents gathered from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, NSA’s name-muscular was this program, which it ran together with its British counterpart-GCAC.
Both agencies stole data passing through the huge fiber optic cable network placed by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post, citing a top-secret document from January 9, 2013, said that more than 18 million documents were collected in just three days after the program began.
These also include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program ran out of the U.S. and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA gain access to this information.
According to the newspaper, running the program outside of the United States was much easier for the NSA, because court orders are necessary for such campaigns in the United States.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied these allegations during a press conference in Washington, D.C., saying, "As far as I know, this has never happened."
The NSA has always gathered all information within the scope of the law.

The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage more reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be completed.
From the year 2015 students will take a separate G.C.E. in the language, and will be very motivated to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will launch a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow – these two will be the first subjects to revolutionize.
It will also change in other major topics next year.
In a separate step, the exam will show the changes that occur in the structure of G.C.S.E. with regulatory off-quality, new rating systems, and lower courses.
Speaking in the summer, Secretary of Education Michael Gove said that “there was too much consensus that, in order to consolidate people’s confidence, we need to improve our own examination system” he said “GCSE will be “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours less a week during the session than most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While, there is no formal requirement to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that being combined for more weight with subjects in the G.C.S.E. league table was likely to encourage additional education in schools.

Emergency Bureau, Srinagar: Police allegedly removed the security of former minister Glam Hassan Khan, who joined Congress from the People's Democratic Party.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying that his security was removed for political reasons.
It is known that the slave Hassan Khan, who won the 2002 election on the ticket of the year PDP from Shoppies, was included in his ministry while serving as head of state.
Slaim Hasan Khan said that I have had security armor since 1996.
I live in the so-called terrorist houses.
A CRPF safety handcuff at my home was deployed under the supervision of all inspectors.
I’ve also had a bodyguard with me, but all of my security was suddenly taken back.
When the security officer was leaving my house, I spoke to the district security officer and the district spy.
But instead of restoring security, he just said he would investigate the case.
In fact, in this context, when the ISP of Kashmir, Abdul Ghani Mir, was contacted, he denied the information of the case, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will myself examine how the security of a former minister and senior Sias leader has been removed.
Pro-Kongress chief Prof. Saffudin Soj said that there is nothing like this in my information.
If a compromise has been made with the security of Hussein Khan, this is a very serious matter.
I'm in Jammu at this time and I'm coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the related administration.
According to this report, during the past four years, the UPA government has spent 8.5 crore.
Rather, in the reversal of Modi’s claims during the NDA rule (between 1999 and 2004) during the PM stay of Attali Vishari Bazepei, a round like this occurred for two consecutive years (2001-2002) when no advertisement was issued by the government over the patel.
On Thursday, Modi said, holding the foundation of the 182 meters high Statue of Unity portrait of Sir Patrick Patel in Gujarat, saying, "There was no advertising on the occasion of the weddings of Sir Patrick Patel before.
The DAVP records indicate that UPA spent 30 million in 2009-10, 4.10 million in 2010-11, 2.7 million in 2011-12 and 1.4 million in 2012-13.
When the Central Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tivari was asked about the claims of Modi, he said that he did not talk on the basis of the PM candidate facts.
UPA was unable to bring any advertisements to Patel in 2008.
He said this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on the advertisements of Mr. Patel is significantly less than the amount spent on the joints and charges of members of the Near-Gang family every year.
The DAVP spent 33 crore on print ads for Mahatma Gandhi’s anniversary and anniversary, 21 crore on former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crore on Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crore on Novohar Red Neeru.
When he asked about this difference, he said, “It should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertising.
Because the price of an advertisement depends on many things, including things like the size of the advertisement or the rate of the advertisement for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it reveals our dedication, which opponents have tried to handle the legacy of a great leader without even going about it.
Today he will meet with the families of those killed in the Fallen Rally last Sunday.
Just a week after the explosion, Nathaniel Modi’s re-attack on the trip has been severely shut down by security forces everywhere.
Police investigated the routes of Modi’s trip and the meetings.
People who attend the meetings will be watched by the police.
The Gujarat police force, the NSDAP and the state police will keep an eye on security.
The security of Modi will be rounded and tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also arisen about the Bishop’s assault trips with people killed in the crash.
The head of state, Nietzsche Kumar, accuses the BJP of spoiling the climate.
Moving forward from soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. George Well is providing free health care in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in Western African countries; there is only one doctor for 5000 people.
Vote here or via mobile.
Dr. George Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone else in the top 10 to make the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Well had watched his sick father go to the hospital unconscious and unconscious, who were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamel Well was injured in a car accident in Cameroon's capital Yunnan in 1981.
At first, only his arm was broken, but an infection grew that spread to his brain, and he formed blood clots, which affected the rest of his life.
George Well says, “There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon.”
If we had money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Welles took his father to the overcrowded clinics and hospitals and received any treatment he could get.
Well said, “It’s not easy.”
You leave the house at 5 a.m. in the hope that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but that doesn’t happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people can sit in the mouth of death waiting.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Well’s father’s death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If we compare, there is a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And even if there were doctors there, many Cameroon residents couldn’t afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the spending on health care in the country comes from the private sector.
Well says, “Their only problem is poverty.”
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Welle made a firm decision to solve it.
Dr. George and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
They themselves became therapists, and began to work as vascular surgeons at the Central Hospital of Yunde.
And they launched the non-profit organization Eskovaim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped approximately 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and up to 30 people sit in vans, hanging medical supplies from the roof and going to rural areas where people need treatment.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to move forward more than once by pushing the vehicle out of the rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they get the honor of truly heroes: feasts, singing and dancing, and the best housing that can be offered by the community.
Free medical services in these villages are indeed a reason to celebrate, and wells – with their great smile and endless energy – include joy-happiness.
The next morning his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
Well said, “We’re meeting 500 people on each trip.”
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekends clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get a suitcase, donated glasses or a free birth certificate – this document is required in school but many poor families can’t afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed at the school building, town hall or home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group’s generator publishes sanitary equipment in the operating room, and Well and his volunteers work up and down every Sunday morning.
It’s a slow pace, but village musicians generally help keep the band motivated.
Well said, “They are playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work.”
On Sunday, their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group - including Camerun physicians and foreign medical students - has done 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they are helping.
One person said that by receiving free hernia surgery he would be able to go back to work.
He said, “This will change the future of me and my family.”
In addition to running weekends clinics and working as surgeons in hospitals, Well also works in private medical clinics around the United at night.
He said this is his second job to finance 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is completed by private donations.
Caty O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drake's University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Well's group, said, "I don't know when they're sleeping."
They are always either in the hospital, or are trying to make money for their organization, so that they continue to run these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join the Wells campaign, this is an experimental opportunity for them, which they could never get in their own country.
O'Malley said, "In power therapy, we help Dr. Well to hold instruments or cleanse blood spots, in which we are able to gain experimental experience."
As a second year medical student in the United States you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students typically spend around to get to Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after the Jews arrive, their stay comes and goes, and the costs of instructions are raised.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Vel, the burden of work is almost like one, no difficulty.
Helping other people to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them so much joy.
Well says, “I’m very happy doing this job.”
And I think about my father.
I hope they’ll see what I’m doing.
I’m doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

Addressing a rally, Modi said, “If you look at the speeches of Congress or Congress leaders in the last two months, then you’ll find that they’re not talking about what they’ve done.”
He said, “Congress has become so selfish that it doesn’t answer media questions.”
Manmohan Singh is the prime minister and his government, but they still need to respond with Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the people.
Obviously, Modi was responding to Sibble who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wanted a controlling environment where he gave his speech and did not talk to reporters to avoid questions.
Sibble also chose to challenge Modi in front of him.
Modi said: “I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms a government in 2014, we will report to the people every year.”

Obama’s Health Service Offer Returned
Amidst the buzz of criticism, President Obama yesterday withdrew his often repeated misleading promise that “you can keep it if you like your health plan.”
Along with receiving withdrawal notifications from their providers by millions of people, Republicans have recently criticized the president for misleading American citizens.
Yesterday Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that “a lot of people who have health insurance, and it’s useful, can keep it.”
Addressing what he calls “the bull of news” about the impeachment, Obama has graciously purchased new coverage in the market from U.S. citizens receiving these reports.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, a comprehensive health care plan in as much money or even cheaper than proposed.
He said, “You’ll get a better deal.”
The administration said it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans because their coverage is not in line with the desired standards under the Payment Care Act.
In a statement in front of the Home Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said: “I tell these American citizens directly, ‘You deserve better.’”
Sebastian, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Act on Responsible Care, said the launch of the online market since October has been “unfortunate.”
He said, “I’m as disappointed and angry as everyone else.”
I want to regain your faith.
After a sharp clash with the Republican, Sebastian from a partner sitting behind him in the House hearing yesterday said this phrase in anger, which one Mike caught.Billy Long, R-Mo about whether they would need to be nominated for Obamacare.
In a hearing lasting more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the “architect” of the Payable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare Dot Gowa, which he is now selling to millions of Americans.
The two-million-dollar buyer’s request for reimbursement was revealed.

Between 25 and 29 dates, someone called from different mobile numbers on their mobile.
The operator asked for two million dollars in return.
Narendra was threatened to kill her daughter.
Narendra didn’t take this threat seriously, but when the threats grew worse and the conversation came to the daughter who studied in class 12th, they got upset.
The family members are worried.
He was complaining about it.
No traces of accusations have yet been found.
In view of the seriousness of the case, the cybersecurity cell is being helped.
In addition, MEPs clouded in the villages of Paraguay, Badeira, Lalaia, Zhejiang, Fuelochari, Gatavali and Malcany to bring together the compatible philosophy, listening to the difficulties of the people and giving instructions to the authorities on occasion for their solution.

As a result, there has now been a decrease in cases of violations.
313 cases against various political parties have been filed since the Code of Conduct came into force on October 4.
From 22 to 27 October, only 31 cases were registered.
The case of violation of the electoral code also came into effect.
There were more complaints in the first few days, but there has been a decrease in the status quo.
It is being that in the early days there were more complaints against political parties because of the lack of full information about the code of conduct.
There are now fewer complaints because of the political parties being aware of and taking lessons from registered cases on the part of the election commission.
Many parties were promoting the election as before in the absence of information, but when action against them took place, they stopped it.
Political parties are following this with obtaining information about the electoral code of conduct.
This also reduces its violations.
In this regard, a proposal has been sent to the government from the side of the ADA, which is soon to appear.
In this historic city, surrounded by Ganga Imuna from three sides, there was no longer such a plot on which ADA could make a large residential plan.
In such a way, it has now been made a mosque to make residential plannings in the east side, in the northern direction, and in the southern direction in the southern direction.
A meeting was held in the headquarters of the General Assembly to give this plan a broad form.
The ADA has created the idea of incorporating two hundred income villages of Fulpur, Sorong and Karatena.
After the arrival of the ADA boundary, the Chaka and the Brave Black will end.
Half of the area of the cowboy black will also be located in the ADA.
According to the secretary of the ADA, Amnesty International, this proposal has been sent to the government.
ADA wants to take the limit of these grams of arbitration into its jurisdiction for planning, on which work will begin soon.
If this happens, the price of buildings in the city will be reduced.
There will also be a lot of people who will be able to access accommodation easily.
Soon, residential palaces will begin to stand in this new area on the threshold of Loğlaou and Noeda.

In New York City, they are still in the same position as they were before.
In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage has "goed far inappropriately."
John Kerry has indicated that the U.S. protective attitude to his surveillance program has softened by unexpectedly acknowledging that sometimes its espionage “goes too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State has also acknowledged that they are also guilty with Barack Obama in the case of being on “automated pilot” as a blatant revelation to Edward Snowden about the N.S.A.’s espionage acts.
This secretion has brought the U.S. government a diplomatic breakthrough in its relations with its allies.
Speaking through video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no question that the president, me, and others in the government really knew about some of the things that would happen with automated pilots, because looking back, the Second World War, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11 had its potential.
They have become the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has widened its boundaries, but have insisted that no one’s rights have been abused.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately.”
And the presidents are determined to try to clarify this to the people and are now thoroughly reviewing it so that no one gets the sensation of abuse.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted that, however, N.S.A. was pursued for good purposes, and its surveillance has saved many lives.
He continued: “We are facing a world where people are ready to fly themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world, committed to killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what’s wrong if you’re able to stop it before it happens?
We’ve saved the plane from actually crashing, buildings from being demolished, and people from being killed because we’re able to know in advance about others’ plans.
During this time, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said U.S. lawmakers would go to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage, and try to explain to European countries the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about threats that they will be prevented from participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
Murphy, president of the first-elected Democratic Party and Senate Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview with Washington, “It is really important for U.S. national security interests that European countries are with us in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts.”
European countries need to make it clear that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be influenced by their anger about the N.S.A. program.
News of N.S.A. recording millions of telephone conversations from Europe has brought trouble in relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said the news is not entirely correct, and reflects a misunderstanding of the metadata shared with the United Nations by NATO allies.
Other revelations in documents leaked by Snowden appear to show that the NSA has monitored the mobile phones of 34 other top leaders in the world, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the spying on allied countries as necessary and said it was common for both sides to do so.
Meanwhile, Murphy said his office is arranging a congressional visit that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped that the Board of Representatives would include both parties and members of both Chambers.
The names of the other collaborating method-makers will continue in the coming days.
He is still working on the travel program.
While Murphy said the purpose of travel is to improve relationships, he said some “practical relationships” should also be given up.
He said European leaders will also have to be honest with their people about their spy programs that have been used for years.
Murphy said, “Al we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying.”

Australian woman appeals against Thai prison period
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in jail in Fuket for wrongly accusing her of attacking a taxi driver and has appealed against the decision.
On June 15, a Fuket provincial court found Steve Russell Bomford guilty of wrongly accusing Thai police of trying to stop him by a local taxi driver along with two other people on Sunday morning on June 10.

Bumford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a lower security detention center in the outer area of Fuket instead of an adult female carnage.
She is the daughter of Phantom Australian League player Peter Tonks, who has appealed to the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to help her daughter.
Tonks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family is "deeply concerned" about the care of their daughter and they want to call her back to Australia.
Tonks said: "Unfortunately this has been a troubling time for us, but we hope he will be home as soon as possible."
Bumfood has appealed against the punishment order, and has been sentenced to 50,000.
During this time, reports in Australia said that she was celebrating holidays at Crabi’s holiday venue in southern Thailand.
Several sources in Thailand said Bambford's case was being fought by a local spokesman in Fuket, but warned that the court could extend his sentence to two years as a result of the appeal and force him to live in adult prison.
