Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

Before you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.

Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic stray cats) that eat the vast majority of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the capelette, a special job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called burrows.
The lion packs are composed of one to three adult males of the same family, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act like wolf packs or cubs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and also extremely deadly to their prey.

The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voice roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase of riddled, unriddled words.
The birds are predators of small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of the animals they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (catch) by their smell, narrating where they have passed on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending with their surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants extract their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.

The mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-like teeth, plus an extra layer in the roof of his mouth, meaning that there was no way to escape anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that he was at least a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that was in the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not resist him.

Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they were scattered on the side of the road while they ate their meals.
The meals of the ancient Romans may not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a pie.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered to be the god's home.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to provide for the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be a part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.

Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the scope/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographic point of view, as an "archipel".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Formosa Island, or Polished Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a transformation in native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in its rice fields and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal regions of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, specifically Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.

For example, the most common format for still photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image-capture formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, in a somewhat surprising way, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is thus said to be 3:2.
Many frequent formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is widely abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamism while preserving a measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective direction for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).



One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary resources of the church are specifically there for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many people to question whether this principle was being respected.

The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing further danger to neutral vessels.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.

After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.

The most well-known of these was the Three Kingdoms period which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war was fought between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
Tri-Kingdom was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.

It is the same for the military because instead of having class-based army classifications, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to attend a pilgrimage which became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the Light) for contemplation.
The balm itself, which has survived over time, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.


Nothing can be seen without the clear, beautifully rounded sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the balma.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.

The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khofo and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khofo's wives and family members.
The "high arch" mark looks like a V and the "low arch mark" looks like a graph or a square that is missing the bottom.
Up means you should start at the punch and throw the arrow, and down means you should start at the hook (which is where your hand holds the arrow) and throw the arrow.
A high bow usually generates a softer sound, while a low bow is louder and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own markings with a peg, but remember that printed marks are here for a musical reason, so they should be customarily respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were sent back from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of women from the market.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the windows of his carriage completely open.

The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to return money for much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.

To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 BC).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological jumping or technological imperative to a strict sense that man's destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.

The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new sleeping techniques to repair bodily damage.
Romance had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.

Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until about 1100 CE.
Their status declined during the 12th century mainly because the crusaders were returning with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.

However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could resonate as early as 25 to 30 years ago.

Subsistence farming is farming that is done by producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using seeds harvested from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which may include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequently used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, misbehavior or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults during the time they were growing up.
Some wild children have been confined by individuals (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the rejection by the parents of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that wild children may have suffered violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or fled.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.

Although project-based learning should be the easiest and most interesting learning, it is a step further.
The Empont is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals experiencing a novel learning experience such as by using a new computer program or by starting a new project.
The Teacher can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of Teacher but it is also the case with the Microsoft Office trombone man.
Virtual Points are embedded in the software and function to question, prompt, and explain processes that may be too complex for the student to manipulate alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, to even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We see the Foster Care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our host family system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring care staff, stable education and reliable health care.

The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and rewards.
Learning and socialization have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement andcontinuous relationships have also been identified as novel aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who were unable to understand a speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to estimate sincerity accurately.
It further suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination merge the two-way variation between all two reservoirs at each generation.
In the savannah, it is hard for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the resources available in plants.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the accessible proteins in leaves and vegetables, but they are poorly digested by primates like us, unless they are cooked.

All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way as chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively discrete revelation to bring you into consciousness without completely awakening.

Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is correlated in an opposite way to the amount of tension of the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were spread through the Mahayana love path and through the techniques of Indian yoga.

Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the end of the war, confrontations of systems, processes and culture led to a rupture between these countries.

It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought outright, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.

However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport products is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and products across oceans.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which used mostly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.

Goats were apparently first domesticated some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasture areas, often overseen by shepherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the generally better-known shepherds. These pastoral methods are still used today.

Though the horse-drawn railways consisted simply of parallel wooden posts, they allowed the horses to pull at higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
The railings were introduced early to keep the rails in place, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron band over them.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began walking in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").

Bipedal specialisations are found on Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems have become greater due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks further to John Dunlap's printing press.

The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.

Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.

They have feet with hooves and claws, they carry eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have no more than one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.

The best indication of an internal warming may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic chemicals in the home.
You should check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with the cimems, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Cimecs and killer cimecs are both nesting rodents, adapted to live in a nest or the housing of their host.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the dominant neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to adopt a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.

Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.

Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by either marking the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the goal of taking advantage of the landscape, including flora and fauna.
examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.

In this dynamic transport hub everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges that are falling.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they not function properly on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?

Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
As a matter of fact, conductors tend to behave in a reasonably consistent wind; thus, circulation currents tend to have some consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to flee from their enemies more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small teeth to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemers.

Some people thought he was right but many people believed otherwise; that the Solar System was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This looks silly, because it doesn't look like the Earth is moving, does it?

Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.You should not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.

There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.

And so, the hedgehog was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
It is sad that with the advent of new writing methods, the written word has been relegated to a lower status and employment.
People now write messages on computers or on computer screens, without ever having to lock themselves with a scraper.
You can only wonder what the keyboard will be when something new arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to throw together a nucleus and strong protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Fracturing will return the nucleus and then release some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei meaning that they tend to separate with a tiny bump or even less.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the opposite side.
It is thinner under the sea and more often in the highlands.
There may be more sea on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people choose or what is of interest to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by the time they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what is there for certain people that makes them envious of the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.

This type of manager has difficulties making unpopular decisions, exercising disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another person transforms into a poorly recognized individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and take ownership of it.
Ultimately, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often results in a rift between the managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet in variable time zones which may not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
Invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.The invisible team sets the rules for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and at the same time share knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that is used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.

The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.

Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and questions, as well as writing, voice and face recognition.

The AI system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, since it has been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom.
Technology provides the solution with virtual tours. Students can look at artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to get involved in an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is remodeled, but the older versions are kept online to serve as albums.

Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school days.
The proper use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of other's writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant bilingual capital and features a good array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is much further south and north is the Muskoka Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario the quintessential Canadian for outsiders.
The larger expanses further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost wild uninhabited regions.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and one of the most isolated wildlife continents.

The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.

Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the emblematic landmark of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for the park for preservation and entrance.
It may also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either select parks within South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be their main interest.
The staggering number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glossy bar chart made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you have to leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront in front.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the land that the British colonists took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans are the world's largest belt of coastal mangroves, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the interior of Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps but comprise some of the last remaining patches of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and approximately 30,000 wild deer in the area.

The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank on the islands that is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and inland from Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, and although British and American currencies may be taken; check with landlords in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is south of the Equator, so it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures in excess of 30°C are frequent.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.

According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/m away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/m away from all other wild animals!
