The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union and/or the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom increased rapidly from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been increasing in the European Union/EU Economic Area and the UK at similar rates, and at varying rates, with COVID-19 infections increasing more rapidly in all countries than in their own countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries should increase the availability of hospitals, intensive care units and COVID-19 patients for potential healthcare needs, especially those requiring intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of unidentified cases of pneumonia were reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the pathogenic agent as Novel coronavirus 2, now known as SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease was later renamed coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
As of now, it is estimated that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have had pneumonia and non-pneumonia due to respiratory tract infections.
14% of COVID-19 cases are critical illnesses requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases are critical illnesses requiring intensive care.
A 4% mortality rate was recorded in patients who had been treated for COVID-19.
In this study, we focused on comparing the COVID-19 burden in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with the Chinese province of Hubei.
We compared COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with cases in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
China is followed by COVID-19 with its respective geographical distribution and the global characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are similar to that of the country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
The first COVID-19 cases in Europe were announced at the Eurosurveveillance meeting on 5 March 2020, using the WHO case translation, Spiteri et al.
The first confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on 24 January 2020 in three people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK). As of 31 December 2019, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported. Of these, 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were reported from Italy alone.
Total number of COVID-19 cases and total incidence
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) regularly updates the COVID-19 data in various countries using data from sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO at 8:00 a.m.
The data was used to analyze COVID-19 developments in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with Italy.
We have set a 14-day COVID-19 vaccination quota for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020 with the proposed natural COVID-19 travel across the EU/EEA and UK to prevent COVID-19 vaccination.
We have compared the Italian census data for the period 31 January-15 March 2020 and presented the national census data for the period 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK
14 days of COVID-19 transmission in EU/EEA countries and the UK after the Chinese Hubei outbreak (Figure 1)
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases began to rise after February 21, and then rose by a factor of 28 after February 2020 (assisted data).
This was largely driven by the large number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have seen similar increases in the overall incidence of COVID-19.
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK compared to the Italian cases from 31 January-15 March 2020.
A lower number of cases was reported in 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy's peak three weeks earlier at 8 a.m. on 15 March.
Our available results show that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK is rising rapidly.
The current volume of COVID-19 cases indicates that the pandemic is spreading relatively quickly in all countries.
This is due to the fact that although countries may have different levels of COVID-19, there are differences in national public health standards, different interpretations of cases that may exist in different countries, and different protocols for selecting patients who are eligible for COVID-19 testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in other regions of Italy who had been infected with the virus were reportedly required intensive care, which is about 10% of all COVID-19 patients, according to media reports.
Currently available COVID-19 intake data at EU/EEA level are 6% in hospital and 1% in intensive care (data not disclosed).
The number of reported cases and deaths should be strategically aligned with the research findings.
A 2010-11 study found a large gender gap in top and middle income income distribution, from 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that these two countries may have a greater or lesser share of the wealth than Italy (12.5 per 100,000 population in 2010-11 for both primary and secondary care).
Modelling conditions related to health care capacity in the EU/EEA and UK for COVID-19 patients in treatment and for emergency care beds with a greater than 90% risk of survival are in sixth place in the ECDC's COVID-19 rapid risk assessment.
In some EU/EEA countries and the UK, treatment and intensive care services in certain regions are provided to people from a limited part of the population, and for patients, the reference class is assigned to the regional unit for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Recent experience from Italy and other countries shows that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing at a faster rate in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries should make necessary preparations for treatment and intensive care units to be able to handle the potential for a future SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the number of COVID-19 cases, as well as to be able to provide healthcare and intensive care facilities in affected areas such as Italy.
A recent ECDC risk assessment report suggested that transmission of SARS-COV-2 could be reduced by adopting a rapid, immediate and inclusive approach.The shift from prevention to reduction is not a solution to the rapidly increasing incidence of infections that we expect, unless it is addressed in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment outlines public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have a short window of opportunity to better control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the burden on food and healthcare.
In other EU/EEA countries, this is not possible and patients requiring high-level care may be left out in a matter of days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3000 people and infected up to 80,000, and is causing devastating outbreaks in other parts of the world.
As with SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from the loci in a similar manner and may cause similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower mortality rate than SARS, is less transmissible and affects older men more than younger men, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on new diseases, this article attempts to provide an overview of the most timely and controversial research project underway.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and immunization of the disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this briefing will help in understanding and eliminating the cause of this disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 is believed to be the most memorable holiday for all Chinese people, who will be on lockdown for weeks due to the new coronavirus pandemic.
The virus has a strong similarity to the SARS coronavirus that caused the 2003 pandemic, and was therefore designated SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020, and its associated disease was designated COVID-19 on February 19, 2020.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to about 50 other countries.
As of March 2, 2020, there were 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients were discharged and 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number one public health threat and is more serious than tuberculosis.
PubMed says that more than 200 articles on COVID-19 virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment have been published in less than two months since the release of the viral sequence from multiple patients on January 7, 2020 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).
This review attempts to summarize the research implications of this new and rapidly growing topic.
When possible, compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, MERS (the 2012 outbreak) and the outbreak in the United States.
We will also discuss the prevention and prognosis of the disease, some emerging questions and what we have learned so far.
CoVs are generally considered non-fatal to humans, with a prevalence of approximately 15% in influenza complications.
However, two outbreaks of CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have occurred in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and have since spread to several countries, causing severe illness and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded CoV pandemic in human history.
As shown in Fig.1.1 on 31 December 2019, the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
A seven-day sequence of CoV was reported.
On 15 January 2020, the first death from the water was confirmed.
In the end, the epidemic is spreading to neighboring cities, states, and countries through Naharri.
On January 20, healthcare providers were alerted to the infection, which was suspected to be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, a public transportation blockade was imposed in Wuhan.
A preliminary clinical study conducted on January 24 found that only 21 of 41 confirmed patients had a direct contact with the unidentified animal from which the disease is believed to have originated.
WHO declared the pandemic a global emergency on January 30.
As of the time of this writing, the epidemic has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
The situation has developed so rapidly that the extent of the outbreak cannot be predicted.
As of February 11, 2020, the Multiple Strength Center has provided the following update on the pandemic, including the most recent case count of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects all age groups, but mainly affects people aged 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the patients were over 50 years old, with some under 20 years old and 14 patients under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was spread in clusters in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The mean duration of the reaction is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days
The base production number ((R0)) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) while the combined R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected with the disease increased sharply on January 23, 2020, due to the hot weather that hit during China's Spring Festival.
The confirmed case fatality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the observed mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three most important risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of adult and envelope viruses with a single strand of RNA.
Alpha, beta, gamma and delta are grouped into four genera, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the dipeptide peptide 4 (DPP4) receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then the membrane fusion is continued.
The viral RNA genome is inserted into the cytoplasm; when the viral genome is synthesized, genomic RNA is transported by envelope glycoproteins and nanocapsid proteins to the plasma membrane to bind with the virus.
The original genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was determined on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel variant of beta-CoV, with a genetic similarity of 99.98% across 10 sequential samples from the Hunan seafood market, where the disease was first discovered.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to MERS-CoV than SaRS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in human respiratory epithelium by electron microscopy in ultrathin units.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV:
However, compared to SARS-CoV, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a lower binding affinity for human ACE2, which corresponds to the mild disease of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunogenicity compared to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may be caused by a novel protein encoded by orf3b and a protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b plays a significant role in viral pathogenicity and IFNβ; production is inhibited by orf8 but has no known functional domain or design.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that a full-length human ACE2 with a 2.9 Å resolution has a B0AT1 amino acid transporter with a cryo-EM structure.
The complex, which has a toxic and toxic structure, is assembled as a dimer, and it has been shown that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can be combined with two S proteins, providing a clue to the identification and infection of the CoV.
A vaccine trial using B0AT1 is required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The belt and the middle belt
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from mosquitoes and have been transmitted to humans by blood-sucking insects and camels, respectively.
Using phylogenetics to compare SARS-CoV-2 to other CoVs, this new virus was found to be 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from the same genus, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, making it the first known carrier of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the primary vector that causes human infection beyond the genital tract has not been identified, and the transmission route has not been determined.
Ji, et al., suggested that the mutations may have been associated with the S protein homologous gene product, which may have prevented the virus from being a carrier in the transmission of the virus from mice to humans.
A study by researchers in Guangzhou, China, found that pangolins are 99% genetically similar to SARS-CoV-2 and that the pangolins, a large-ranging, scavenger predator used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2, according to a study.
However, the 1% difference in two genomes is itself a significant difference and the final results need to be anticipated to provide a definitive explanation. (Fig. (Fig.33))
The physiochemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a hot environment for up to 48 hours and in temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius and 40%-50% humidity for about 1.5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar reaction.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be debilitated by ultraviolet radiation and 56°C for 30 minutes. 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, pyractic acid, chloroform and other fatty fluids, but chlorhexidine, may be able to debilitate the virus.
Humans have a low immune response to SARS-CoV-2 making them susceptible to the new virus.
At present, no detailed determination of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been made.
In addition, we have seen previous studies of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4)
After the virus has infected the host, it is initially recognized by the host's innate immune system, including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Using various mechanisms, the virus reduces the spread of the virus by inducing inflammatory factors, the development of dendritic cells and the production of Type I interferons (IFNs) and the virus's antigen is eliminated by the macrophage.
The SARS-CoV N protein helps the virus evade the immune system.
The innate immune system starts its activity by joining the others to fight the virus.
T lymphocytes such as CD4+ and CD8+ play a major role in the immune response.
CD4+ T cells activate B cells to release antibodies against the virus; and CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
T helper cells produce antibodies called cytokines to help protect the host cells.
However, CoV can infect T-cells by inducing apoptosis.
Hemorrhagic immunity, such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is required to protect against the virus.
For example, antibodies from recovered patients are susceptible to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system in the lungs can cause severe damage to other organs and in the worst cases, death, including multiple organ damage.
SARS-CoV-2 infection may be more effective in older adults and pregnant women with underlying health conditions when initiated in a group setting.
People who have been exposed to multiple viruses and whose immune systems are weakened are more likely to be infected than others.
The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is on average 1-14 days, with a duration of 3-7 weeks in the initial 425 cases identified in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period is on average 3 days and can range from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study of 8,866 people found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) weeks.
The medical authorities have been working to ensure that the appointment time is correct and that patients who are not showing symptoms do not spread the disease.
It is common for people infected with the virus to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The primary and important symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which may be present alone or with other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, sinus pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have shown symptoms of dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after a few days of being treated for the disease.
In severe cases, patients with severe respiratory problems such as septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy develop rapidly.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute febrile symptoms should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis even if there is no lung radiation test that indicates the disease.
A demographic survey conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptomatic cases was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dehydration, and 3% for diarrhea, with 8% of the total patients requiring respiratory support.
Two recent studies of family groups and other groups of people infected by a single person without symptoms found similar results.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study reported that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% more people than COVID-19 require respiratory support.It is also more dangerous than COVID-19 and MERS.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat hemorrhoids (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
Fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms of SARS patients, and respiratory support was required in about 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the total number of cases reached 66:576 worldwide, with a 2% risk of COVID-19 deaths.
In contrast, the SARS death rate in 2002 was found to be 10% of the 8,096 cases.
For MERS, the June 2012 demographic data showed a 37% mortality rate with 2,494 confirmed cases.
SARS-CoV-2 R0 is 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 whereas SARS-CoV R0 is 2 to 4 pure, according to a previous study.
A comparison of symptoms and R0 between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV is shown in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher infectivity and lower lethality compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more difficult to control than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Group travel occurs within the same household or from the same gathering or in a vehicle such as a cargo ship.
Patients with a long travel history, living in Wuhan or other affected areas, and who had contact with an infected or uninfected person in the last two weeks.
However, they suggest that the quarantine period should be extended as patients may remain asymptomatic for longer periods and recovered patients may still carry the virus.
In the first stage, patients have reduced or normal peripheral blood clotting (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphadenesia with white blood cell count &lt;4×109/L and lymphocyte count &lt;1×109/L, high amytroflow levels and viral counts were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Most patients have elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in their blood, and in some patients, elevated levels of liver and mucosal enzymes and myoglobin.
In severely injured patients, D-dimer levels, blood fibrin production, and lymphocyte counts are significantly reduced.
Unusual symptoms seen on chest radiography are common in most COVID-19 patients, such as patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
In most patients, they develop into uncommon pneumonia, sudden lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
ARDS causes uncontrolled burning, fluid accumulation and subsequent fibrosis, which can cause air exchange problems.
If type-I and type-II lymphocytes are not produced properly, the surfactant levels decrease, increasing the surface tension of the lungs, and reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand and close.
Therefore, the worse lung RA score we get is associated with a higher risk of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed with ARDS and other viral diseases, similar to the symptoms of SARS and MERS; pulmonary embolism, hyaline membrane, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of people who died from the disease.
Separation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase has been used as a main method for the detection of COVID-19.
However, false-negative rates are high and the pandemic could be further exacerbated, and diagnostic testing using post-clinical symptoms (not limited to RT-PCR) was introduced in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred in the SARS case.
Therefore, the history of the disease, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and radiological findings are all important in reaching a conclusive diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Yang group announced the use of a protocol for the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for the isolation of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the isolation of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter) by dipstick, without the need for additional equipment, in less than one hour.
The new technique is expected to bring about a change in the form of a more flexible and convenient interface.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, clinicians are known to provide only general care to patients with COVID-19.Alongside, trials are being conducted with therapies for CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases.Table (Table2.2).
These treatments include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It has been suggested that plasma from recovered patients could be used as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies to the virus and vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the lung and to a lesser extent other ACE2-containing organs such as the respiratory tract system and kidneys.
However, respiratory problems and failure are the leading causes of death for patients with the most serious complications.
Therefore, respiratory support is critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, including oxygen, as variations in severity of the disease include high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation.
Patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms are treated with extracorporeal oxygen management (ECMO), a novel cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for patients with severe cardiac or respiratory distress.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting the peripheral organs are critical for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
This cytokine storm occurs when patients with SARS and MERS respond to an over-expressed immune response.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response caused by inflammation of various cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines activate immune cells to destroy free radicals, causing ARDS and many other internal organ disorders.
Immunosuppression is useful for treating patients with severe disease, especially those with cytokine deficiency.
Toxicilumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, and corticosteroids have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Cytotoxin Storm includes other immune responses by cell-mediated immune response modulators, IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF inhibitors; NKB blinatumomab; cytokine signaling and 4HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used to reduce the severity of the SARS infection.
However, high doses of steroids are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
They alter the course of the disease by eliminating dangerous side effects such as avascular osteonecrosis.
However, it is recommended that corticosteroid-only courses be used in low to moderate doses in severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been developed.
However, a test with nucleotide analogues has been found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus infections.
Later, Remdesivir was shown to be able to kill MERS and SARS viruses, as well as other RNA viruses with a single strand.
Inspired by this, Gilead sent a batch of tests to China on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as therapeutic agents for patients with acute respiratory failure.
Concomitant use of lopinavir/ritonavir may result in vomiting, dizziness, vomiting, liver damage and other risks.
The use of these treatments in combination with other medicines in patients should be treated with caution.
Plasma and antibody selection from surviving patients
There is a long history of using blood from people who have recovered from infectious diseases as a medicine for patients who have not yet recovered, and as a preventive measure for people who have not yet been infected.
In fact, people who have survived the disease have higher levels of antibodies in their blood to protect against the disease.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes, which attack pathogens and other foreign substances and are separated by individual molecules in the cells.
In addition, plasma blood from patients recovering from COVID-19 was donated to 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with a lower infection rate and lower viral load, accompanied by improved oxygenation.
However, before a drug is developed, it must be proven that it can be used on a large scale.
In addition, some plasma-related defects should be considered in terms of clinical efficacy.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the immune system and cause a dangerous disease called Rellys syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is very low. Patients with severe disease have a high demand for plasma.
It is difficult to rapidly produce specific antibodies to prevent infection.
Therefore, it is important to find the genetic code that encodes the effective antibodies or the effective antibodies that work to destroy the main viral protein by extracting B cells from the surviving human.
This can be used to estimate the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, the results are based on the diagnosis of the disease and the combination of components using the switching formula in TCM theory.
It is difficult to isolate such components, and most of the active components are unknown or not well known.
Currently, there is no known cure for COVID-19 and no single treatment is available, making TCM one of the leading options for treating patients with mild to moderate symptoms and severe cases.
For example, the capsules of Zhu Feng Ji Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
In the treatment of COVID-19 patients, many states have recorded high survival rates, including Guangzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), where TCM was used in 87% of patients, and Hubei Province, where TCM was used in only 30% of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest survival rate (13%)
However, this is a comparison that is not very accurate as other factors such as weight and number of patients were not included in the estimate.
On February 18, 2020, Boley Jang and colleagues presented a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with WM treatment in combination with TCM.
Unlike the WM group, the fever of patients in the WM+TCM group requires only a short time to return to normal, symptoms disappear and treatment is terminated.
Surprisingly, the reduction in symptoms (from mild to severe) in the WM+TCM group was less than that in the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was lower than that in the WM-only group (8.8% versus 39%).
To ensure the efficacy and safety of TCM, a randomized, controlled trial should be conducted at a larger scale and in more facilities.
The practice of reducing the effectiveness of TCM treatments and reducing the side effects of their components as much as possible is very attractive.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience severe fears of the disease's contagion and risk, and those in isolation experience diarrhea, sickness and vomiting.
In addition, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, and vomiting, and other unintended effects such as corticosteroid-induced sleep problems (insomnia) can lead to depression and mental instability.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, mental illnesses such as chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and epilepsy were reported.
The COVID-19 lockdown and quarantine mandate is causing people to become more stressed and anxious.
Therefore, psychological support should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and their contacts, and the general public.
The June-Psychological Support includes the use of teams of mental health professionals from many professions, a clear and regular communication of treatment plans for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and skills upgrades for the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with people.
Effective vaccines are needed to break the chain of transmission from infected animals and patients to healthy people.The vaccine, in combination with antiviral drugs, is being used to control the pandemic.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine based on S protein with long-lasting, high-potential and effective antibodies that will enhance immunity to SARS-CoV.
Vaccines made from the weakened strains of SARS have been tested in animals.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in adults and the efficacy of the animal-derived vaccine in lethal-testing models are still to be determined prior to the start of clinical trials.
This is because no new cases have been reported since the SARS epidemic ended 17 years ago.
Relatively uncommon MERS cases and clusters have been found in the Middle East and spread to other areas through animal vectors.
A vaccine strategy for MERS has been developed using uninfected viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant proteins and subunits. Some have been tested in animals.
A vaccine that is safe and effective for people who are not immune to SARS-CoV-2 is needed to control this next outbreak.
However, due to the variable nature of the CoVs, the extended time required to develop a vaccine (on average 18 months) is very difficult to overcome.
COVID-19 is a new disease and the full clinical course of the disease has now been established in thousands of patients.
Often, patients survive without any treatment.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with higher rates of psychiatric complications and death in those with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary to build a model that expresses the disease's aspiration to give priority to transparency to health agencies, especially in areas with capacity constraints.
Based on the clinical studies conducted so far, the following factors are considered to be the most likely cause of COVID-19 (Sanduk (Sanduk33):
Age is important for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS and COVID-19.
The persistence of 8866 cases as described above indicates that COVID-19 primarily occurs in the age group of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% are over 50 years.
Patients waiting for intensive care services are those with chronic health conditions and older adults (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age plays a role in the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As noted above, SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect more females than males (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000).
Additional illnesses and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require high-level medical care are at greater risk of sudden cardiac arrest and arrhythmia compared to others.
Heart-related events also played a significant role in SARS deaths.
There is evidence that SARS-COV-2 can cause bronchiolitis by binding to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes in COVID-19 patients.
Attention should be paid to the fact that age and health conditions may be related and contrasted.
Laboratory results, which are out of the ordinary, indicate the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood, the extent of inflammation or tissue damage, and can tell us about the disease's predisposition, response to medication, and survival of the patient.
It has also been suggested that CRP levels may correlate with COVID-19 prognosis.
It also has the potential to stimulate high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) in the body.
These enzymes are produced during tissue damage and are found in various organs, especially in the liver and small intestine.
Therefore, it is the heart or the lungs that tell us about the disease.
Major clinical symptoms, radiography of the periphery for the temporary development of clinical symptoms, together with other conditions, should be considered in predicting the outcome of COVID-19 and the fluctuations that may result.
The use of steroids, as mentioned above, is that steroids are immunosuppressants and are commonly used as adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of infectious diseases.
High doses of corticosteroids were administered to severe SARS patients, and most of the survivors developed a disease called avascular osteonecrosis, which led to lifelong disability and poor survival.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we see people being isolated and seeing close relatives and patients die, and many patients suffer from depression.
It is clear that the patients should be provided with psychological counseling and long-term support to help them recover from depression and return to their normal lives.
Based on population-based studies, COVID-19 has a different epidemiological profile from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in the lower respiratory tract, while other CoVs that cause measles, such as SARS-CoV-2, are transmitted in the upper respiratory tract in the so-called mild phase of the disease.
Therefore, patients who are in the early or late stages of infection are more likely to produce large amounts of virus during their daily movements, which poses a major challenge to controlling the pandemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is higher in patients who are critically ill and much lower in patients who are in the initial stages of infection.
Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic is considered to be more dangerous than the SARS pandemic.
Various efforts are underway in China to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic by closing water and sanitation and keeping the population safe.
Although these actions hurt the economy and other sectors of the country, they are reducing the number of new cases, which indicates that the epidemic is slowing down.
The epidemic is thought to have ended in March, with a small number of cases expected to persist for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so positive.
Paul Hunter, et al. predict that COVID-19, which appears to be less severe than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population by modeling the outbreak.
A Canadian team reports that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in both mid-turbine and throat-bathing tubes of patients who were discharged from hospital less than two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered cyclic virus could be a possible influenza-like illness.
However, as new cases have become less frequent, there have been promising signs in China that these current strategies may be working.
Ebola is estimated to cause about one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, strict quarantine and isolation have been able to bring the disease under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is less susceptible to infection and death and is more likely to be a co-infectious virus with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious with fever and cough, and can also be transmitted by continuous contact with infected materials.
The virus is found in saliva and is thought to have the potential to transmit from the mouth to the throat.
The latest findings from 138 cases show that 41% of cases were caused by nosocomial infections, of which 40 were healthcare providers, including 17 patients with other medical conditions.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect the public, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, staff and even those who are not in their duty to interact with patients.
The first line of defense is to wear a face mask, such as a surgical mask or a N95 respirator (series # 1860s), which can be used to reduce the risk of infection and help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent the fluid from an infected person from escaping into the air and from sticking to surfaces of objects and spreading to other people.
However, only the N95 (series # 1860s) mask is able to protect against viruses with a range of 10 to 80 nm. Only 5% of these viruses can penetrate the mask. The size of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is around 85 nm.
Healthcare providers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks rather than surgical masks, as hundreds may be required to fit up to five surgical masks.
Health professionals should wear face masks and white gloves to reduce the spread of the virus.
Viruses can be transmitted through the eyes of dogs.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask.
Health care professionals should wear a face mask or a reflective goggle when treating patients.
It is important that people living in affected areas wash their hands with soap more often than usual, stay at home and minimize contact with infected people.
People should stay three feet away from the sick person.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the disease from spreading.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus to humans, it was announced on January 7, 2020, that its similarity to SARS-CoV should have been a major concern for China, based on the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center had failed to convince the public that the novel virus had low transmission, limited human-to-human spread, and was not difficult to contain.
The message eased fears in the population, especially after the country had passed a critical period of time to control the epidemic while the disease was still in Wuhan.
The China Disease Control Agency has made this a critical lesson and could lead to further significant improvements.
For example, these agencies should: 1) be careful about the use of ambiguous terms in public statements as they may change the perception and decisions of citizens; 2) avoid waiting for regular statements from doctors or other authorities; 3) avoid unusual clinical reports that are confusing and biased; 4) avoid engaging in preventive work at the earliest stages of the epidemic to inform the public about the epidemic; and 5) improve public awareness and understanding of the pandemic by identifying clear and targeted approaches to the community's detection and response system in a systematic manner.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel virus known as SARS-CoV-2 began in December 2019.
In less than two months at the time of writing, it has spread throughout China and to over 50 countries.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused similar sensation to SARS-CoV, as the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS in the control of the disease and the pandemic.
COVID-19 affects more adults than youth, and more men than women.The risk and mortality rate of the disease is higher in older adults than in younger adults.
SARS has a higher mortality rate (10.91% vs. 1.44%) compared to COVID-19.
Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients are more likely to transmit the virus, while SARS patients are more likely to do so during peak incidence, making COVID-19 control much more difficult than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may have a second strain of the virus.
These contacts are based on the rapid spread of the virus.
In the rapid COVID-19 testing, several key challenges await resolution.
Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate?
Although 96% genetic homologues were found between SARS-CoV-2 and two mouse SARS-like CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out as a mouse.
What is the animal that is the primary carrier of the virus, and the intermediary from mosquitoes to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot stop the disease completely and therefore the pandemic could come back again in the future.
How does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause pathological changes, even though molecular modeling and biochemical assays suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2?
Does the virus also contain ACE2-EXPRESSING genes?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot provide prompt diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long can the pandemic last?
How does the virus show genetic changes during human-to-human transmission?
Will the world end up with a pandemic like SARS or will it recover like the flu?
It is important, however, that time is needed to conduct the research needed to answer the above and other questions.
However, we have no choice but to end the pandemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives, whatever the cost.
The zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
Coronavirus and CoVs have mutated and mutated their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years due to mutation and recruitment.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause a central disease, such as tuberculosis.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown that the transmission of HCoV infection is life-threatening.
SARS-CoV-2 was able to capture the attention of European controlled co-viruses in central China in 2019. CoVs show a lower immunity than SARS-CoV, although they are highly transmissible.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and is useful to understand the zoonotic origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs are derived from non-pathogenic protozoa.
The intermediate host of HCoVs is also known.
Knowing the animal's genome plays a major role in finding the disease's immune response.
The study and testing of animal-to-animal contact with CoV viruses will provide a better understanding of the transmission of the disease.
This study incorporates our knowledge of the seven HCoVs based on their detection history and animal-to-human transmission.
The main focus is on the similarity and differences between different strains of HCoVs based on viral mutation and genome sequencing.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this article.
In addition, we discussed the impact of the transmission from host to host and the spread of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are classified with the family of viruses called Coronaviridae, which includes enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA virus groups.
These viruses are called CoVs due to their large genome size of 26 to 32 kg and their invisible structure.
Non-viral CoVs have similar genomic structures.
Two thirds of this genome, in turn, have two large open-loop transcription reader frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate to pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
These polyproteins form a complex of unfolded proteins called nsp1~16.
The remaining portion of the genome consists of the amorphous protein ORF, spike (S), membrane (E), membrane-linear (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Lineage-specific helper proteins are coated by different lineages of CoVs.
CoVs are divided into four (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV) based on their differences in protein structure.
Paleogenic evidence Bats and mice are the gene sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, and birds are the primary hosts for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been breaking through the ethnic barriers and some have become potent human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
There are two alpha-CoVs between HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
Five other known beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 exhibit symptoms such as fever and cough.
Compared to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2, it has a much higher susceptibility to disease, with a higher risk of severe lower respiratory tract infections and a higher risk of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and non-pulmonary symptoms in most people.
The first HCoV-229E, B814, was identified in 1960 from a tuberculosis patient's liver.
Much more insight has since been gained through studies of the viruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.
Prior to the SARS pandemic, it was believed that the disease caused by HCoVs was not harmful.
The worst SARS outbreak in history occurred in 2003, affecting more than 8,000 people, 10% of whom died.
After decades, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has become an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula and has spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a strain of the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) that has killed over 3,120 people and infected over 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven strains of HCoVs originate from insects, bats, and other related species.
Many lines of evidence suggest that all HCoVs originated from the cochlea, but that viruses are not well adapted and pathogenic, but show wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major medical, scientific, social and moral disruptions in China and the world.
To trace the zoonotic origins of HCoVs requires understanding the causes of natural history, driving forces, and species limitations.
This can guide and predict the location of the host, the number and distribution of animal hosts (the host) cells for SARS-CoV-2, and the useful measures to be taken to prevent further spread.
This review includes the animal-specificity of HCoVs, their ability to transmit from animal to animal and their ability to cause disease.
In particular, we discussed the similarities between HCoVs that do not cause disease in their host, but that begin to mutate after transmission to another species.
The ability of HCoV to transmit trans-species is largely due to its reduced pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is also discussed in this proposal.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial detection of the HCoV-229E strain B814 from a human tuberculosis patient, several viruses were detected in several animals, including bats, bats, rats, cats and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief synthesis of the history of HCoVs in chronological order (Table 1) is instructive and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated in 1966 from people with upper respiratory disease, but was later infected and able to grow in the WI-38 pulmonary tract.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common respiratory symptoms, including headache, nausea, allergy and sore throat, with a 10 to 20% reduction in the incidence of fever and fever.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was identified from organ cultures and subsequently in the brains of rats.
Clinical detection of HCoV-OC43 infection is similar to HCoV-229E, but does not cause any symptoms that are distinct from other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are transmitted globally, and are likely to become more widespread in the wild this season.
In general, the incubation period of the two viruses is less than a week, followed by an infection of about 2 weeks.
Research in volunteers indicates that people infected with HCoV-229E have moderate symptoms of influenza.
Only a few of the patients with weakened immune systems developed severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is the first HCoV-CoV to be documented to cause a pandemic in human history, and the third HCoV to be identified.
The first SARS case was reported in 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
A total of 8,096 people have been infected with SARS in multiple countries and territories, with 774 of them facing death.
With the exception of the most highly contagious, each case can produce approximately two new cases, which require an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with the highest viral load occurring on day 10.
People infected with SARS-CoV show symptoms of severe chest pain, headache, fever, fatigue and nausea, shortness of breath, fever and respiratory illness.
Lymphonia, abnormal liver function tests, and high creatinine kinase levels are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffuse aliviolar lesions, epithelial cell rupture and macrophage proliferation have been reported in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, organs such as the larynx, the stomach and the kidneys can also be affected in the event of a serious disease. In such cases, the presence of high levels of cytokines can cause severe complications in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from open lung biopsy of a patient who had traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, several efforts have been made to study HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was first isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in 2004.
It was first detected in children, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems who had respiratory disease.
Symptoms of cholera, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in infections with HCoV-NL63.
Other successful studies have found that a child in the Netherlands with pneumonia at 8 months old has the same virus as in the Ancha swab sample.
Although it is known in the Netherlands, it is also known internationally.
HCoV-NL63 has caused up to 4.7% of the common respiratory infections, with the main cases occurring in early winter, spring and summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the blockage of the salivary glands.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man in Hong Kong who had been admitted for treatment for pneumonia and bronchitis.
HCoV-HKU1 is also related to Acut in the community of pneumonia and bronchitis.
Along with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has also been found globally, causing mild respiratory infections.
These four locally transmitted HCoVs are well tolerated and have low potential to cause severe disease, although several strains of HCoV-NL63 have been identified as the cause of severe lower respiratory illness in China in recent years for unknown reasons.
The ability to transmit and bind HCoVs to the host reduces the risk of infection.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia in a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney disease.
Most of the cases tested by the laboratory came from the Middle East, and several European countries and Tunisia have been reported as secondary transmission sites for the most recent cases.
186 confirmed cases of second-stage pandemic were reported in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are those of SARS, followed by severe pneumonia with induction.
Unlike SARS, MERS-infected patients are more likely to develop acute kidney disease, which makes the disease unique from other HCoV-infected diseases.
Over 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have shown a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most viruses known to infect humans.
In December 2019, a case of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared this new low respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a global public health threat, and has given it the name COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases and 3.4% of deaths were reported globally.
In Hawai'i, the death rate is 4.2%, while in other parts of China, the death rate is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
A rash has been reported in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to severe respiratory distress syndrome.
SARS-CoV is similar to SARS-CoV-2 with a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, although they are placed in different phylogenetic branches.
SARS-CoV-2 has a lower incidence and higher probability of transmission compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in people who do not show symptoms have been reported and are contributing to the rapid spread worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 shows significant similarities and differences compared to the other six HCoVs.
First, the genome sequence of HCoV infections is very similar to that of Zika.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 has followed the path of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is based on the difference between SARS-CoV and the four environmentally-transmitted HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections often exhibit the same characteristics as HCoVs transmitted from the environment, including being imperfect, mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic.
On the other hand, a small number of severe cases of COVID-19 may be considered as cases of SARS-CoV infection, although the incidence is low.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a surprising combination of environmentally transmitted HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the other hand, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of HCoVs transmitted from the environment.
On the other hand, it is not yet known whether SARS-CoV-2 will reduce its human-to-human transmission capacity, as will SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HIV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples:
The role of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in certain cases, such as SARS-CoV, is expected to be defined in future studies.
The seasonal variation of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be found in populations infected with HCoVs.
However, the nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and its risk are being overlooked by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The four HCoVs detected in the community show mild symptoms of disease.
Humans, on the other hand, may have been infected with all four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the original HCoV outbreak.
There are no HCoVs that have caused severe disease in humans today, and no individuals have exhibited symptoms of HCoV-related acute respiratory distress syndrome.
For this to occur, mutation genes that reduce the conditions for the large-scale proliferation of HCoVs must be stimulated.
Therefore, the more the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues and the more people are infected, the greater the risk of transmission to humans.
If managed properly, a pandemic can be difficult to control through quarantine or other measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been infecting people with measles.
These viruses need a home environment.
In general, SARS-CoV, which has a high disease-like potential, is not well adapted to MERS-CoV and its human-to-human transmission cannot be controlled.
They must stay and reproduce in their zoonotic habitats and seek the opportunity to attack a viable human target, using one or more intermediate and reproductive habitats.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four other environmentally transmitted HCoVs.
This is similar to the HCoVs found in the environment, which are more widely distributed, at least temporarily.
However, it is more resistant than community-acquired HCoVs and more resistant than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet known whether it will fully adapt to humans or whether it will be able to move around humans without a shelter or a pet shelter.
Prior to the use of HCoVs in the animal population, it is useful to investigate the evolution of HCoVs, natural selection, intermediate selection and selective selection.
Animals are considered to be the host of HCoVs, while the homology of their host is determined by the sequence of nucleotides.
This hereditary virus is naturally occurring in its host and does not cause disease.
Thus, the human body can be a long-term host for HCoV.
In both cases, these hosts are the natural hosts of the HCoV or its progenitor viruses.
In contrast, if an animal infected with HCoV is transmitted to humans in a short period of time, the virus can cause severe disease as it is not transmissible to the new carrier.
The central carrier of the virus, the animal, serves as a vector for human infection and also plays a major role in the virus's ability to survive in the animal's body for a short period of time.
HCoVs can cause infection if they are not able to remain viable in an intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can adapt to host migrants and can survive long periods of isolation.
During this time, the cerebral cortex becomes the natural seat.
Epidemiological data from the SARS index case has a history of association with game animals.
Sequential seroprevalence testing shows that pet traders are higher carriers of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The enveloped larvae (Pagoema larvata) and the raccoon were the first to be identified as carriers of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses.
This was helped by the failure to report the SARS case, as all the victims were killed in the market.
However, the captive wild or farm animals without live animal market testing were largely negative for SARS-CoV, indicating that captive wild animals were intermediate host species rather than central host species for SARS-CoV.
Specifically, over 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, not to mention that small predators of various species serve as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
These all appear to be the deadly endpoints of the SARS-CoV bed.
Recent animal studies have shown SARS-CoV natural reservoirs associated with bat CoV, SARS-associated rhinoceros bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horses' hooves.
These samples were positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other locust CoV and SARS-CoV have 88-92% nucleotide similarity.
These studies have suggested a new way for mosquitoes to produce human pathogens.
Many SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are derived from mosquitoes, but none other than WIV1 are viable viruses.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for SARS-CoV.
A sample of the platelets from WIV1 was tested for platelets, flies and humans with ACE2 as the cell portal receptor.
Surprisingly, SARS patients with convexity were able to eliminate WIV1.
As of this date, WIV1 is the ancestor of SARS-CoV in Loquehteto with 95% nucleotide similarity.
Although there is high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is not believed to be the SARS-CoV intermediate and its sequences are not SARS-CoV intermediates.
Palogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV has been associated with the CoV-HKU4 strain of the mosquito and the CoV-HKU5 strain of the mosquito.
Both the novel coronavirus CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a similar viral receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as the starting point.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV has structural similarity to beta-CoVs found in Africa and Europe.
So far, no MERS-CoV has been found alive in desert algae.
MERS-CoV has 87% homology of the nucleotide sequence to its close relative, Leukichetov CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, mosquitoes may not be a direct intermediate host for MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dremondary camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific intermediate antibodies, as are their Middle Eastern relatives from countries of origin in Africa.
The surviving MERS-CoV is identical to the virus found in humans, which was isolated from the nasal swab of a dromedary camel, suggesting that camels serve as a host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that in the case of MERS-CoV infected camels, mild symptoms were observed with a high viral load.
Apparently, infected camels not only transmit the virus by inhaling it, but also by passing it from the esophagus to the mouth, which is the main route by which the bats transmit the virus.
However, since there are no known cases of MERS in camels, questions are being raised, including the possibility that human-to-human transmission could be a source of transmission for MERS-CoV, including an unknown animal strain.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology with the mosquito CoV RaTG13, which was isolated from Rhinofilus affinis mosquitoes.
In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is difficult to separate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 sequence mutation.
This means that the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected unless a similar number of virulent CoVs are discovered in the future.
A wholesale market in Hunan, where animals are slaughtered and sold, reports the first cases of COVID-19 infection.
Several recent studies have shown that several endangered invasive species such as pangolins (Manis javanica) can carry their own lineage of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs based on their metagenomic sequences.
These new pangolin CoV genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
But they have 90% nucleotide homology with RaTG13.
Two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2 are classified as viruses in the pyelogenetic branches, one of which is identical to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence and a very similar receptor (RBD).
In Stark comparisons, the SARS-CoV-2 RaTG13 and RBD strains are divergent, although with a high degree of homology in genome sequence.
A study in infected pangolins reported the detection of viral contents from a lung sample, which were similar to those associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study used a variety of assembly and management techniques to sequence a portion of the genome, which comprised 86.3% of the total length of the virus genome.
Pangolin has the potential to be an intermediate animal host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct ancestry of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins, as the sequence exchange between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins produces SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the monkey is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in mosquitoes, pangolins and other insects is still unknown.
The highest sequence homology was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and panglion; SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
The high similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs in Pangolin RBD is an evolutionary convergence obtained by selectivity.
Another proposal is needed to recombine RaTG13 with the panglion SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV in a third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving force, recombination of beta-CoVs has become widespread.
The jury is working to determine the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly infectious HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have been studied for their zoonotic origin.
The phylogenetic analysis of HCoV-NL63 indicates that HCoV-229E is derived from bat CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are derived from mice.
A variant of HCoV-NL63 similar to ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) has been reported in North America.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is generally associated with another leucitoid CoV, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and is suspected to have an intermediate host.
The animal-based classification of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2 to the present.
Paleogenetic analysis suggests that there is a history of evidence of cross-species transmission of HCoVs.
HCoV-OC43 was declared a respiratory infection pandemic in 1890 when it began to infect humans by crossing from domestic animals.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between different animal species is unclear.
Loquat alpha-CoVs have been found to have a high affinity to HCoV-229E.
Alpha-CoV alpeca is among them.
Evidence suggests that the virus is transmitted directly from humans to humans.
Before the alpacas, humans lived in the same ecosystem as the lochuca.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated mosquito alpha-CoVs are rare and non-pathogenic to mosquitoes; alopecia alpha-CoV has caused a respiratory infection epidemic in infected animals.
Finally, alopeca-alpha-CoV has not been detected in animal models.
Therefore, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that alpacas may have transmitted HCoV-229E-associated alpha-CoVs from humans.
In fact, mosquitoes are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nifa virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that HCoV-229E infections can be transmitted directly to humans.
Although the alpha-CoVs of Loququito are resistant to HCoV-229E, animals such as alpacas and the Arabian camel have been able to transmit MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV may be the best example of a cross-species transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of the MERS-CoV from the mosquitoes was identified in the initial identification and confirmed by subsequent detections.
It is clear that infected mosquitoes carry multiple strains of the virus, which may lead to cross-species transmission.
The reason why bats are the main vector of transmission is because of their longevity, good habitat, close interactions and ability to self-explain.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for decades.
He has successfully bred with these camels and has been a permanent resident.
In these animals, MERS-CoV is mildly pathogenic and has low mutation potential.
The transmission of the disease to humans is rare and occasional, and humans are the last known carriers of MERS-CoV, making the pandemic unlikely to be permanent.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, if any, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unique.
In particular, pangolin beta -CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
The end-resort is the SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs, which may be more virulent than SARS-CoV.
The role of SARS-CoV-2 in animal-mediated transmission is expected to be revealed in future studies.
First, the SARS-CoV-2 related virus may serve as a host for a similar infection to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with the reptiles by breeding or pollinating them.
In addition, pangolin cattle have been found to be one of the most potent vectors of SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans are infected by the virus through the bite and consumption of meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Permission to conduct antibody studies in wild and domestic animals.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and replication of SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in a third strain if it is related to both the two species of coelacanth and pangolin.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
There are three main methods to prevent CoVs from migrating from these different types of animal shelters.
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other RNA viruses with long-lived RNAs, the mutation rate of CoVs is thought to be higher than the average.The average infection rate is ~10-4 infections per year per site 2, which is considered to be the most common in the new host with CoV.
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease and have a high rate of replication and mutation.
The nucleotide analog Ramdesvir inhibits the replication of CoVs by inhibiting exoribonuclease and RNA polymerization.
Remdesivir is the most promising SARS-CoV-2 antibody in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are in excess of their host population by millions.
CoVs also mutate and adapt rapidly when inactivated.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mitigation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a low mitigation rate, indicating a high potential for human transmission.
It may have evolved into a human-like animal.
In addition, SARS-CoV-2, which also includes MERS-CoV, is well adapted to dromedary camels.
In theory, genetic variation does not make a vaccine or antiviral effective against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome of CoVs also exhibited a flexible genome modification and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of cross-species transmission and co-proliferation, which would allow for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
These are encoded by the previously read codon and protein functions up to the last 3 genes.
During the third stage of replication, RNA CoVs change their shape and location abruptly and repeatedly.
A host that serves as a cell host, strand replacement is frequently produced in CoV RNA transcription.
RNAs of similar length and subgenome can be combined to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of natural recombination phylogenetics has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal-infected CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The first is to prevent the spread of the disease.
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, interaction of the virus with its host host is a key factor affecting its ability to transmit from species to species.
The SARS-CoV hybrid could be used as an example, which provides evidence of positive selection among various animal species during transmission.
Comparisons between human and wild SARS-CoVs have shown that SARS-CoV is easily transmissible to a variety of hosts, particularly through RBD mitosis of the S protein.
In general, the RBD of the S protein of the CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is a fragment on the 318 to 510 amino acid S1 chain, which is linked to the human ACE2 co-receptor and viral entry.
RBD can detect the ACE2 receptors of various animals including bats, mice, rats, and dogs, allowing the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acids were found to be different from the human and RBD-derived mouse viruses, and 4 were found to be present in the receptor-associated motif to bind to the ACE2 receptor.
The mutation of SARS-CoV K479N to S487T has mitosis in RBD, potentially increasing the potential for these spike proteins to interact with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be critical for viral to human transmission.
It should be noted that SARS-CoVs-2 share the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein of the S protein and its ability to bind to human ACE2.
In a cryo-EM study, the combination of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein was found to be 10 to 20 times higher.
It should also be noted that additional receptors are required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Unfortunately, HCoV-NL63 is also related to ACE2 but is a separate subunit of S.
There are several HCoV receptors such as aminopeptidase A for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
CoVs that have been transmitted from various animals to humans may have a genetic basis.
In addition to this bioreceptor, the outcome of these interspecies transmission of HCoVs is determined by other host cell and limiting factors.
The isolation of these host proteins between humans and the natural hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, dromedary camels and mice, may limit the transmission of HCoVs from species to species.
HCoVs are susceptible to cellular pathogenicity, and the cellular limitations of the pathogen have been reduced to allow for proper interspecies transmission.
Therefore, the molecular key to the relationship between the virus and the virus carrier is not yet known.
The use of non-compatible genome-wide detection and the limiting causes of SARS-CoV-2 could be further investigated using the CRISPR art technology method.
The emergence of new HCoVs: a return to zero
Mutations of the existing CoVs provide a great opportunity for emergence of new HCoVs.
That is, the HCoVs served as the gene pool for the HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mitigation and genetic recombination are the two steps that serve as the key to the development of HCoV.
For example, the addition or removal of new protein-coding genes has the potential to significantly alter viral phenotypes.
The ORF8 receptor protein from SARS-CoV is not found in the SARS-CoV locus; it is believed to be the ORF8 that caused transmission to humans.
The 29-niclotide sequence of SARS-CoVs has been characterized in human pandemic initiators from different strains.
This gene cuts ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, which are inherited mutations that allow the virus to be transmitted from one carrier to another.
SARS-CoVs have a history of association with the alpha and gamma lineages, and a large number of small recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-resistant RNA polymerase.
In nsp9, most of nsp10 and some of nsp14 are isolated within the recycling regions.
At the same time, the MERS-CoV pandemic was found to have spread across several lineages of infectious organisms, including one in Saudi Arabia's Derrymondry camels.
Hybridisation is also seen in HCoVs, except for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. HCoVs are genetically unrelated to animal co-viruses.
Artificial selection can also produce unwanted changes in the virus genome.
An example of these effects is the loss of the full ORF4 size due to the double-neuroxide deletion of HCoV-229E's protease structure.
Uncontaminated ORF4 is found in HCoV-229E-like viruses in rabbits and camels.Alpaca alpha-CoV shows nucleotide infection and produces a frameshift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is selectively driven by their host pressures.
The vaccines were found to be asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic when exposed to CoVs, suggesting a dual pattern of CoVs and vaccination.
The results show that the mice are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to the CoVs.
For example, the difficulty of stimulating the pre-exposure response of the placenta significantly reduces the pathology caused by CoVs.
In addition, their killing activity in the locusto is inhibited by NKG2/CD94 receptors and low histocompatibility.
This, in addition to high levels of reactivation of oxygen species (ROS) from the high levels of leukocytes, can reduce the CoV's metabolic activity and can be influenced by exoribonuclease, so the evolution of viral strains can be highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host.
Additional pathogenic CoVs can be infected by altering the protein or protein characteristics.
Therefore, the emergence of three new HCoVs in the past two decades is not a coincidence.
CoVs are viruses that are either nonpathogenic or have only mild symptoms and are confined to the hive and camel.
They grow rapidly in the absence of a strong immune system.
It is possible to discover the mystery of why people who are asymptomatic and why this infection causes severe disease in humans.
These severe symptoms are often caused by a severe immune system response, and cytokine strokes in immunocompromised patients can cause severe lung damage.
In contrast, those who are asymptomatic carriers of the virus,
Delinking the same to the immune system may have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
This interference response is particularly strong in the larvae.
Therefore, it is useful to give type I interferon to early stage human SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflammatory response does not work in rats.
Therefore, MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 by inhibiting the synthesis of NLRP3.
The SARS-CoV-2 Emergency was followed by a general sequence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
The beta-CoV of Lochte has a 95% similarity to the nucleotide of SARS-CoV and a 96% similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
Although animals in the market have been found to have the same virus as SARS-CoV-2, a direct intermediate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
Pangolin beta-CoVs are strangely homogeneous with SARS-CoV-2, meaning that pangolins may serve as intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to the final stage of the SARS-CoV-2 gene fragment.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either accidental or deliberately engineered.
CoVs have been identified in the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
We have also identified the role of zoonotic origins and animal shelters in the transmission of human HCoVs in the detection of viruses and other animal CoVs.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to originate from mosquitoes and have been transmitted to humans through other intermediaries.
The SARS-CoV vaccine could effectively end the SARS epidemic by preventing the spread of infection from humans to pests in the market, closing the cheap markets and killing the pests.
For the same reason, pangolin should be withdrawn from the market to prevent the transmission of zoonoses, as pangolin beta-CoVs are associated with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of several lineages.
However, future studies will determine how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans from panglios and other parasites.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as a useful transportation and a major source of meat, grain, leather and leather products for humans.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is possible to sacrifice all camels in order to control MERS, as in China, SARS-CoV has been introduced to the wildlife market to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent MERS outbreaks, a holistic approach to the development of a suitable vaccine against MERS-CoV in camels is needed, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause epidemics.
Many human-to-animal CoVs are transmitted between animals.
There are many types of respiratory CoVs that can be transmitted to humans.
These animal CoVs are more stable and have a larger circulation and transmission potential, and can produce CoVs that are more dangerous to humans.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be banned to reduce the gap between humans and animals.
Better preparedness and response should be in place for the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis.
Indeed, many viruses have been on this planet for a very long time.
They are said to remain in their natural habitat until the possibility of breeding.
Although bats have many ways to transmit the virus, the transmission can be reduced by reducing human contact with bats and other wildlife.
Strict control of mammals should be implemented to reduce the possibility of animal-to-human transmission of disease.
To put it simply, the most effective way to prevent animal-to-human disease is to avoid the living environment of animals that are carriers of the dangerous virus.
There are also unknown aspects of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the subclass.
First, if bats transmitted SARS-CoV-2 virus from their own offspring via pangolins, it is important to understand how bats and pangolins share similar ecological niches.
As a major contributor to the transmission of the disease to humans, contact with animals should be limited.
Third, if a third predator is to be considered a viable intermediate host, it must adapt to how it interacts with different human species, including bats and pangolins.
Finally, many farmed animals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and surveillance and testing should be done for infections.
SARS-CoV-2, or the parent virus, is believed to be present in the natural environment of the future of the monkey, pangolin and other mammals.
A local test linked human immunodeficiency to SARS-CoV-2 mutation in animals.
The criteria for testing of suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be updated periodically.
The article published by our team on February 6, 2020, provides an active witness to the global response to the pandemic by providing rapid guidance and practices for the investigation and recommendation of the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease.Studies and clinical experience in the community are gradually expanding our understanding.Therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies will be continuously improved and adapted.
In this letter, we have issued new guidelines for testing of suspected and confirmed cases, in response to a comment on our guidelines, which was revised by the new Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the China National Health Committee.
The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), currently known as 2019 (SARS-CoV-2), began to spread in December 2019, and the virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
We have developed a rapid response strategy for successfully fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections and published it online on February 6, 2020 in Military Medical Research.
It has attracted more attention than it has been published.
However, given that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on current research findings and clinical practice, so the diagnostic and management strategy is continually being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of China published a total of seven editions of its COVID-19 Test and Treatment Guidelines from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020 with changes.
We have seen and accepted the view of Zhou et al., that a simple benchmark was created based on clinical experience.
Their work is also useful for the global pandemic as it provides new information for our policy.
may we show our gratitude by supporting their important work.
However, their system needs to be upgraded based on the new COVID-19 (Trial seventh version) diagnostic and treatment guidelines and new research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the case-control needs of suspects, one sample of epidemiologic history and two samples of clinical samples can be combined to create a robust study, or three samples of clinical evidence if there is no clear epidemiologic history.
epidemiological history: (1) travel history, resident of Wuhan and surrounding areas where COVID-19 cases were reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients (confirmed by nucleic acid testing), (3) history of contact with fever or other respiratory symptoms resident of Wuhan and surrounding areas where COVID-19 cases were reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, (4) history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases in 2 weeks with infection and/or other respiratory symptoms, especially in areas such as bathrooms, offices, or school classrooms, etc.)
Clinical description: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms, (2) characteristic signs of COVID-19 infection, and (3) total number of white blood cells, normal, or missing lymphocytes at an earlier stage of infection.
Diagnostic confirmation of suspected pathogenic or serological infections by the following tests: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole viral genome sequencing with high homogeneity with known coronaviruses; (3) positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody; or SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody mutation from negative to positive; or ≥4 times titration from acute phase during recovery phase.
Real-time PCR for nucleic acid samples for respiratory and blood tests were published in the second and third editions (18 January 2020) and (22 January 2020).
The cause of the blood transfusion was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, after which the serological theme was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the efforts of researchers to develop a smart nucleic acid detection kit.It also relies on the optimal collection of blood and respiratory samples and the introduction of positive antibody results into the validated assays.
Studies show that people with unusual symptoms and those without symptoms need to be monitored.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be improved to show that people with no symptoms are at a lower risk.
This approach requires further practical and research verification.
We hope to get a clearer understanding and our readers will call us and give their views.
Local guidelines should be used to separate suspected cases from confirmed cases.
Our team provides practical guidance and assistance.
Bangladesh reports five COVID-19 deaths, the highest on a single day
Bangladesh has confirmed five deaths from COVID-19 in the past month.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day caused by the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) had 114 active cases and 33 out of the remaining cases were in remission.
In total, 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that the death toll included four men and women.
Dr. Meerjady said that two cases were over the age of 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was 41-50 years old.
Both cases are from Fatika.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic on March 11.
Hospital officials told Anadolu Agency, local news, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Mater Hospital.
In an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bintulu Obaidul Quader announced that public transport will be closed for a longer period than initially planned, until next Monday.
The public transportation shutdown began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on April 4.
Transportation of basic necessities -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- is still permitted.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on 8 March, two people who had returned from Italy and their spouse.
As of March 19, the three men have been arrested.
SARS-CoV-2 global transmission has exceeded one million
As of Thursday, the total number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone comes on the same day that Malawi had its first confirmed case of coronavirus and Zambia recorded its first death from the virus.
North Korea has declared itself one of the few countries free of coronavirus, starting Thursday.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases as of 79,332 cases were reported in the twenty-four hours after 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported that more than 1,000 U.S. deaths were reported Wednesday from coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Around the world, countries that are not the most affected by the disease have announced severe restrictions on its spread.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said Russians would continue to receive their allowances until April 30.
Portugal's parliament votes by 215 to 10 with one abstention to extend the national emergency for 15 days.
Saudi Arabia has suspended curfews on its holy sites in Mecca and Medina for the entire day; previously, curfews were from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand has imposed a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine says the state has extended the stay-at-home order to May 1.
In Australia, shops have reduced the number of softwares they can buy at a time.
On Saturday night, the Australian retail chain Walworths relaxed restrictions on Coles and Coles on the exchange of a limited number of packets of cheques.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a one-backout ban.
These restrictions were applied to posts on Facebook and other social media.
The fear of self-immunisation due to COVID-19 has led to an increase in overdose.
On Thursday, Walworth decided to sell one packet of toilet paper per order sent to the home.
These changes followed a ban on the import of more than 40 bags of the same type of food by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
In a statement on March 8, Coles said that while the ban on over forty baked goods was in place, many stores were closing within an hour of a visit. He described the request as unusual, while ALDI posted on Facebook on Tuesday as unexpected.
A Walworths representative said that the markets have shown a significant increase in the past week.
Costco in Canberra has doubled the size of its permitted packages since last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered a large roll of supplies and repeat visits, Woolworth ordered additional supplies, and ALDI made the scheduled Wednesday special available.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Consumer Council, tried to raise prices, but was hampered by a temporary ban on car travel imposed by the Environment Council.
Stores expect to increase the price of products rather than filling the demand.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to rush hour closures, some stores will be unable to open their Wednesday specials.
According to a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, notes that the stores are filling up every night.
The shrimp is a huge commodity, with very small volumes on sale, and, when all is sold, leaves many warehouses empty, which exacerbates the feeling of scarcity.
"If we could have more coal and walnuts on the shelves, more toilet paper and more products like sanitiser, maybe we could have a better chance of reducing the risk", said Russell Zeman, an investigator for ABC News.
Recycled paper shredders are expected to end production last Thursday.
Kimberly-Clark and Sorbent, the makers of the paper clinker, and Solaris Pepper, the makers of the paper, are working 24/7 to keep the leak clear, News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some sellers have offered free shuttle tickets to the first bidders in the Melbourne auction, with a limited number of bids being made for the weekend, with the day-long shopping banquet being held by Seneca.
NT News, a daily newspaper in Darwin, published an eight-page section in its Thursday edition that could be cut and used as a blank sheet.
According to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, the stores were initially reluctant to enforce the ban, saying they had no rules on the quantity of products they could import.
Russell Zimmerman said other products were in high demand, including masks, sanitary fluids, cleaning products, washing aids and towels.
Similarly, outside of Australia, the UK online supermarket Okado was seen limiting the 12 roll packet on the Andres's toilet paper offer on Saturday evening.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 an epidemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared that the COVID-19 - caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - is a pandemic.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that governments act when the term "epidemic" does not refer to the severity of the disease but rather to the extent of the risk".
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
"The WHO's Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that countries should respond to their citizens by recruiting, screening, identifying, monitoring and traveling".
We are deeply concerned about the alarming scale and persistence of this and the alarming level of neglect.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, the current director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the outbreak was "unexpected".
"According to CNN's February issue, 'except for influenza, no respiratory virus has been able to stop its global spread from its source.'"
The Governor of the State of Texas has made a similar comment, saying that there has never been a coronavirus pandemic like this.
'We have never seen a pandemic that can be contained in the same amount of time before,' he continued.
The new recommendation follows a January WHO advisory decision declaring a public health emergency that requires global attention.
"The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said, "the end of the line, it's going to be very, very tough".
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 and 4,600 deaths have been reported worldwide.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuation of the 2019 pandemic disease coronavirus (COVID-19), which is caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and declared a global emergency on February 30, 2020, and the pandemic was officially recognized on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, and 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate was estimated to be 4% in China and 13.04% globally, ranging from .08% in New Zealand to .04% in Algeria.
The common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
The symptoms may include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The period of exposure should be five days, but the period of exposure should be more than fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral drug to date.
The first is symptomatic and supportive care. Hand washing, mouth washing, social distancing, and the individual monitoring of suspected patients are some examples of precautions that can be taken as pre-treatment.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace injury prevention, and lockdowns.
The pandemic has led to a number of global social and economic disruptions, including the cancellation of sporting events, religious, political and cultural events, time limits, and emergency lockdowns.
Schools and higher education institutions have been closed at the national and regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's students.
False information about the virus has been spread through the Internet, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination towards Chinese people, as well as other East and Southeast Asian people, who are likely to be from areas affected by the virus.
By reducing travel and closing heavy industry, it has reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China, the capital of Hubei Province, began testing in early January 2020 after a report of an unidentified pneumonia case was made on December 31, 2019.
Most of the cases were linked to the wholesale market of fish and seafood, so the virus is thought to have originated from animals.
The virus that caused the outbreak, SARS-CoV-2, is a novel virus that is similar to the coronavirus found in bats, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.The first person to show symptoms was diagnosed on 1 December 2019, and the person was not apparently related to the later identified group of market fish and other organisms.
Two-thirds of the first group of patients identified in December 2019 had contact with the marketplace.
On 13 March 2020, an unnamed source reported that, going back to 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old case in Hubei Province may be the initial case.The WHO reported on 26 February 2020, that while the number of confirmed cases in China decreased, cases outside of China were among the first cases to be detected in China, surpassing those in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
There may be a very high number of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms, that need to be reported.
On 26 February, the lowest number of cases occurred among young people, with 2.4% of the global population aged 19 and younger.Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be immunised against the virus if herd immunity is to be developed.
Cases are defined as the number of people tested for COVID-19 and whose test results are positive according to the protocols developed.
As of 23 March, no country had more than 3% of its population tested.Many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had official policies to not test those with low symptoms.
As of 23 January, about 86% of COVID-19 cases in China had not been detected, and these unrecorded infections were the source of the outbreak in 79% of those detected, according to a study published on 16 March.
Italy's case numbers are expected to be higher than the previously estimated, according to a report published on 30 March.
The initial baseline estimates for COVID-19 reproduction rate (R0) were 1.4 to 2.4.
The risk, as recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is estimated to be 5.7 percent.
Many people with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not, the time from onset of symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were among those over 60 years old, and 75% had other chronic health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 is likely to be higher, as it does not take into account those who died untested at home, in care facilities, etc.
Data from Italy show that the death toll during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson acknowledged that "we have reduced our mortality expectations", which is a reflection of the U.S. underestimation of the number of cases of swine flu in 2009 that was due to the H1N1 virus.The first confirmed case was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020".
The first death outside mainland China was reported in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was reported in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported in Iran, South Korea, and Italy, excluding mainland China.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories from all continents reported killings by the Yuka Antarctic.
These figures vary by region and time, influenced by the number of tests performed, the availability of health care systems, treatment options, the time since the start of the epidemic, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and health status.
The global rate of death and disease is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204), according to Johns Hopkins University statistics as of 10 April 2020.
The number is divided by region.
In China, the relative mortality and morbidity rates have decreased from 17.3% (for those diagnosed on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those diagnosed after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the case fatality rate, the average mortality rate of those diagnosed as a percentage, and the infection fatality rate, the average mortality rate of those diagnosed as a percentage and those not diagnosed as a percentage.
These statistics are not time-bound; population densities are driven by the number of infections.
Many scholars have attempted to construct these numbers in a limited population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimated the infection mortality rate for the pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
This high R-value is consistent with the results of the German COVID-19 emergency testing and the statistical consistency of the CFR testing.
WHO has said that the epidemic is under control.
The intensity of the epidemic and how long it will last is unknown.
Despite the lack of control, Massiege Bonny of Penn State University says, infectious diseases can spread and become harmful after the presence of infected people.
However, it is not possible to give an accurate forecast of when it will happen at this time.
" The Chinese government's current medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, has urged all countries to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to contain the virus, arguing that ""the threat of a pandemic could be eliminated"".
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 can survive for up to one or two years.
According to a study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures, including vaccination, are recommended for 18 months and beyond.
William Shaffner of Vanderbilt University, who said that "the coronavirus is a highly transmissible virus that will not go away", said that "it may come back every year, depending on the weather".
The case of reinfection is based on community prevention and the spread of the infection.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are not as well differentiated by their relative severity, and people who have been infected with the virus may not show any symptoms.
Fever (88%) and dry cough (68%) are the most common symptoms.
Many uncommon symptoms include fatigue, loss of respiratory fluid, difficulty in swallowing, shortness of breath, joint and joint pain, sore throat, headache, convulsions, vomiting, hemoptysis, fluid retention, cyanosis, and more.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one in six people may experience severe illness and respiratory distress.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the symptoms of urgency, including shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or tightness, and general trembling, movement, and swelling of the lips or face. It also recommends that emergency treatment be used when these symptoms occur. As the disease progresses, severe lung infection, respiratory distress, respiratory infection, bleeding and fever can result.
Some of those infected may show no symptoms, meaning no clinical signs, but tests have confirmed the presence of infection.Therefore, researchers recommend that those who have close contact with a confirmed case should be closely monitored and tested for the presence of infection.
China's asymptomatic population is expected to grow by 44% from a few years ago.
The incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is usually five days, although it ranges from one to 14 days.The incidence of cases of COVID-19 with loss of olfactory sensation has decreased from an initial 30% to 15%, for example, due to ambiguity.
The exact way in which the disease is transmitted is still being studied.
The disease is mainly transmitted by microorganisms that are released during close contact, such as close contact, i.e. within 1-2 metres (3-6 feet) or when unnoticed by the naked eye, such as when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Studies have shown that uncovered ureters can travel from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Although the virus is not airborne, some suggest that the virus is transmitted by small, airborne particles that can be produced during speech. Respiratory particles can be produced during breathing, including during speech.
These substances can be absorbed by people near the mouth or nose or can enter the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as deep intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), cause the virus to be transmitted through the air by mixing air with the air in the respiratory tract.
The virus can be transmitted by touching an infected object or object, such as skin, eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are fears that it could be transmitted through the earth, the risk is very low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted through the air.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, but may continue to spread during the later stages of the disease before symptoms appear.
People can be confirmed to be infected by testing three days before they develop symptoms, which indicates that there is no infectiousness.
There are few people with laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic infection, but studies have shown that in certain countries, people can transmit disease without any symptoms.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimates that although the mode of transmission is unknown, it is likely to be one to two or three times more likely to occur in a single person. The virus can persist on the surface of the body from hours to days.
In its most obvious form, the virus can be detected in plastic (polypropylene) up to three times, 304 stainless steel up to one day, and copper up to four hours.
However, this is dependent on the distance and temperature.Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
British authorities have found no evidence that the virus is transmitted from animals to humans, although they have recommended that people wash their hands after touching animals, as well as after touching infected objects.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus 2 and was isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia associated with severe respiratory complications in Wuhan.
All forms of the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the same natural coronaviruses. Extrasolar toxins can kill the virus by breaking down its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 closely resembles the former SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have originated from an animal.
Genetic analysis of coronavirus has shown that it is genetically related to the betacoronavirus, and at the subgenus level it is related to other mosquito-borne viruses and the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B).
It is similar to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) at 96% of full genome levels.
Chinese researchers in February 2020 found that viruses between humans and pangolins differed by only one amino acid.
Complete genetic similarities show that at least 92% of the genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is identical, which is not enough to confirm that pangolin is the intermediate carrier.
If symptoms of infection are detected, they should be confirmed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test or CT imaging.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and CT showed that CT is more effective at detecting the disease than PCR, but it is less effective at detecting other types of pneumonia and other diseases.
" Starting in March 2020, the American College of Radiology has advised that "" CT should not be used as an initial screening test for COVID-19"". "
Several protocols for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were published by WHO.
The test used is called real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a sample of body fluids or blood.
The results are usually available within a few hours to days.
Generally, this test can be done with a nasal and a throat swab or a throat swab.Antibiotic tests are also being developed by various laboratories and companies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been adequately validated for widespread use.
Antivirus testing in the US is being conducted by Cellex, with its accredited laboratories approved for use by emergency services.
Radiographic CT images of people who were not symptomatic showed asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is publishing the results of the imaging of certified patients on the World Wide Web.
COVID-19 cannot be detected by PCR alone, as it can be similar to other infectious diseases such as adenovirus.
The results of the cardiac CT are lower than those of the PCR in isolating the virus from other diseases, but the specificity and detection of the disease is high, as shown by a large study in China. This suggests that it can be used as a screening tool in outbreak areas.
Both radiographs and CT scans of viral images are being developed in artificial intelligence-driven convolutional neural networks.
Physical hygiene, such as washing hands, wiping the hands, not touching the nose or mouth, coughing or sneezing into the soft palate, and then properly flossing the soft palate are some of the measures to prevent infection.
People who may have been exposed to the contamination are advised to wear surgical masks in public during off-peak hours.
Physical distancing measures have been put in place to prevent transmission, and most governments have banned all non-essential travel to and from countries affected by the pandemic and have restricted travel to avoid the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a point of community transmission in most countries around the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members are not aware of where and how they may have been infected.Health care professionals treating infected individuals are advised to take appropriate precautions, including precautions and eye-guarding.Preparation for root collection is critical to prevent further transmission and to identify the source of infection.
Local government information systems have raised questions about the use of mobile phone data by intruders, and more than 100 organizations, including Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for the use of such devices to be restricted.
Different mobile apps have been implemented or are available for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen teams of professionals are working on non-intrusive solutions, such as distributing user proximity to other phones using Bluetooth.
Then, if the staff is in close contact with someone who has been infected with COVID-19, a message will be sent. The current approaches to prevent infection, such as washing the nose with water or using a mouthwash, are not effective.
Although many companies are working to develop it, there is no COVID-19 vaccine yet.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.
The CDC advises people to wash their hands with soap and water continuously for at least ten seconds, especially after using a toilet or if there are no visible spots, before eating and after vomiting, coughing or sneezing.
This can kill the virus outside the human body, by destroying the soap's immune system;
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based sanitizers that are at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands.
Surfaces of bodies can be cleaned of dust by various chemicals (and stainless steel within one minute after use of the antibacterial) including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine.
Others, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, have a reduced activity.
CDC recommends that in any facility, such as an office-confined child care facility, all shared offices, restrooms, shared spaces, shared tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines, and electronic devices used by the public should be disinfected and sanitized.
Health authorities recommend that people who have used a mask to cover their mouth, nose, and palms should wash their hands and face immediately.
People with the disease are advised to wear a medical mask. Wearing a mask is useful during speech, to prevent coughing and to reduce the frequency and distance of airway disturbances.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use face masks.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said that touching the face with unwashed hands is a major transmission factor, and that wearing a mask encourages people to avoid covering their faces.
WHO recommends that people in good health, including those receiving care for COVID-19, wear face masks only when their exposure is high, despite the belief that wearing a face mask may prevent people from hiding their faces.
Many countries are encouraging members of the public to wear face masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medical fabric masks.China recommends the use of disposable medical masks, especially disposable medical masks, for use by members of the general public in the community, in order to avoid contact with other people within 1 meter (3 feet) of each other.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks in public transportation, including in crowded areas.
Thai medical experts encourage people to make face masks themselves at home and use them after washing.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without masks and face masks.
On March 16, Vietnam issued a call for all people going to public places to wear face masks to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires that anyone entering a liquor store must wear a face and mask.
Israel requires all residents to wear face masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has been producing tens of millions of face masks for the nation since mid-March, has mandated masks for all passengers on trains and city buses from April 1.
Panama is making it important to wear face masks when going outdoors, and is encouraging home-made masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (i.e. physical distancing) includes the use of infection control to prevent the spread of the disease by avoiding close contact.
Quarantine, travel restrictions, and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, and shopping areas are some of the measures that can be taken.
Individuals can implement social distancing measures by staying at home, reducing personal travel, avoiding going to public places, exchanging greetings without being greeted, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments have issued or are issuing guidelines to maintain social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of people recommended by the US health authorities to attend the event dropped from 250 (if there were no confirmed COVID-19 cases in the region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned outdoor gatherings of more than two people.People with advanced and chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, respiratory illness, hypertension, and poor immune systems are more likely to become ill and to develop seizures.The CDC therefore advised people to stay at home as much as possible, especially in areas with a community outbreak.At the end of March 2020, the CDC and other health authorities began recommending social distancing instead of social distancing.This is why social distancing is being promoted to reduce physical or social distancing.
The use of the term social distancing, along with other alternatives to contacting others, has led to a shift in the perception of purity.Some authorities have ordered sexual health guidelines to be implemented in the spring.
They recommend that only the person who has had sexual contact with you and is not infected with the virus should be the symptom.
It is recommended that those who are infected with COVID-19 and suspect they may have been infected stay at home and lie down.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for measles transmission. Many governments have recommended or mandated quarantine for all people living in areas affected by measles.
Improved self-isolation guidelines have been announced for high-risk groups.
Those who have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19 and have recently returned from a high-incidence country are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from their last contact.
The measures to control the epidemic are prevention, control and reduction.
The initial phase of the campaign was focused on containment, which aimed to monitor and isolate those infected, along with other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the virus cannot be contained, efforts are slowed down, and measures are taken to reduce the spread and the impact on health care systems and communities.
It can be managed simultaneously using control and intelligence.
The virus replication is below normal and requires robust measures to eradicate the virus. Some of the control measures include the reduction of the incidence of the epidemic or the spread of the epidemic.
This will reduce the risk of over-service delivery and provide more time for healthcare providers to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-drug prophylaxis has been used to great effect in controlling the epidemic.These methods include measures that can be taken by individuals such as hand washing, wearing masks and self-quarantine, social distancing measures such as school closures, gathering, and community hygiene.Improved measures such as city closures and travel restrictions were implemented in China as the pandemic spread.
Other countries are also working on different protocols to contain the spread of the virus.
South Korea has issued a warning on the movement of individuals by introducing mass cleaning and quarantine.
Singapore has introduced a lockdown for those who have been vaccinated and those who have quarantined their homes, and imposed heavy financial penalties on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan has imposed sanctions on face mask products and medical supplies.The UK and US have vowed to list topics that will reduce (but not halt) the spread of the pandemic, but will face major challenges to the authorities (such as countering the spread of the pandemic).
Moderate prevention policies have reduced access to health care by two-thirds and the death rate by half. Hundreds of thousands of deaths and treatment overcrowding are expected.
Awareness may be necessary, but it must continue until the virus stops circulating in the population, as there is a vaccine, if available, and if not available early, as the outbreak could re-emerge if restrictions are not applied.
Measures to curb the epidemic could lead to social and economic disruption.
There is currently no antiviral drug that works against COVID-19, but trials are underway to develop and test existing drugs.
Taking medication, taking fluids, and taking a vacation can slow down the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use can have adverse effects.
The role of previously approved antiviral therapies for other viruses in the treatment of COVID-19 is being studied.
The WHO has stated that "some traditional and home remedies for infectious diseases" may be a factor in the development of symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-19".
Capacity building and adapting healthcare facilities to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients are considered critical elements in the response to the pandemic, according to WHO.
ECDC and WHO Europe have developed guidelines for hospitals and healthcare facilities in Europe, which will briefly describe how healthcare facilities should use their resources to provide laboratory services focused on COVID-19 testing, perform non-emergency surgery, isolate COVID-19 patients, and assess the capacity of intensive care and the number of beds and ventilators.
There is much speculation as to where the first patient (called Patient Zero) came from.
The first known case of the new coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei had skyrocketed.
One theory is that the virus originated from these animals.On December 26, a large number of people with tuberculosis were treated at the Hubei Hospital by Dr. Zhang Jixia, who reported the case to the Wuhan and Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a team of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their staff about a coronavirus similar to the one in the country.
Eight of these doctors were executed by the police for lying and for providing false documents. No, she was executed for her crimes.
The Wuhan Health Commission issued a public alert on 31 December, following which the WHO was notified.
At the beginning of January, enough unknown pneumonia cases were reported to Wuhan health officials to allow for investigations.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, aided by the Chinese New Year celebrations and Wuhan being a transportation hub and major railway junction.
On January 20, China reported almost 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The latest official data shows 6,174 people were symptomatic as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the countries with the highest number of cases were China and Italy.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported globally, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 people recovering.
Nearly 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Many Schengen countries have restricted free movement in Europe and increased border controls due to the pandemic.
Current measures for national control include quarantine (i.e. stay at home or shelter or lockdown cities) and early entry.As of 2 April, about 300 million, or about 90% of the United States population, were under some form of quarantine.More than 50 million people have been placed under quarantine in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion of the world's population was under quarantine. Two days later, this number had risen to 2.6 billion - about a third of the world's population.
The first COVID-19 case was reported in the water on 1 December 2019, but an unconfirmed report says the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with a severe case of pneumonia on December 26, and the hospital where she worked reported to the Wuhan Jiangsu CDC on December 27.
On 27 December 2019, genetic tests on patients showed that a coronavirus similar to SARS was detected.
A public statement was made by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commissioner on December 31.
The World Health Organization (WHO) received the information on the same day.
"During these statements, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police that they were 'feverish.'"
China's National Health Commission has previously said there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a campaign to contain the virus, dubbed the "People's Conflict", which was later described by Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping.
"The 'largest dog in human history' was declared clean on January 23, ending the movement of people to and from Wuhan, spreading to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a population of 57 million".
The use of private cars was forbidden in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations are cancelled in many places.
A makeshift hospital called Huashengtan Hospital, built in 10 days, has been demolished, officials say.
A second hospital, Leichenshan Hospital, was later opened to increase patient capacity.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 other public places in Wuhan, such as assembly halls and stadiums, into makeshift hospitals.On 26 January, the government took other measures, including the introduction of health regulations for travelers and the Spring Festival curbs, which it said would help contain the COVID-19 outbreak.
Universities and schools across the country are also closed.
Hong Kong and Macau have taken many measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Measures to create distance in limited areas have been implemented in China.
Walking trips from and to Hubei have been cancelled.
Public transportation has been improved, and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
" Public movement controls were implemented in most cities, with some 760 million people (half the population) facing some form of outdoor restrictions. Before the pandemic reached international levels in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "infecting" other countries. "
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day quarantine on all international travellers entering the city.On March 23, only one case was transferred domestically in five days in Mainland China, and it was a case of a person who was returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that the domestic spread of the virus would be radically halted and the pandemic in China would be brought under control.
Outside Wuhan, travel restrictions were lifted in Hubei on the same day, two months after the lockdown was imposed, with the Chinese Foreign Ministry announcing on March 26, 2020, that entry would be restricted to all visa and passport holders starting March 28, but no details were given on when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies and consulates.
The Chinese government has encouraged factories and businesses to reopen by March 30 with financial support.The National Consulate has declared three minutes of silence and a day of mourning on April 4 at 10:00 a.m.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China on January 20, 2020.
The country's health agency has reported a spike in confirmed cases on February 20 due to the newly established Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu.
Shinchengis from Wuhan to Daegu are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 or 13% of the 9,336 parishes reported symptoms. South Korea declared a state of high alert on February 23, 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on 28 February.
All South Korean military bases are under quarantine after three South Korean soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules have also changed as a result of the impact.South Korea has introduced the world's largest and best-organized community-based testing for the virus, and has focused on identifying and isolating those infected and those who have had contact with those who have been infected.
The cleaning routes that are important for new international visitors include a signboard that can be completed via a mobile app, a daily testing capacity that reaches 20,000 road tests, and a daily testing capacity that reaches the results the next day after testing.
South Korea's plans to contain the outbreak are considered unlikely to be successful, even without a national lockdown.The South Korean public has welcomed President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans are collecting signatures, blaming Moon for the government's handling of the pandemic and for the restrictions imposed by the government.
On March 23, South Korea recorded its lowest daily cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was announced that all new foreign visitors would be quarantined for two weeks starting from 1 April.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for investigative assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran declared the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Kom on February 19, and later that day, according to the Minister of Health and Medical Education, two people died.
Measures already taken by the government include cancellation of concerts and cultural performances, Friday prayers, closure of universities and higher education institutions, and the closure of schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there are no plans to impose curfews in the affected areas, but only in private.
The inter-city travel restrictions were lifted in March, but intense inter-city traffic movements continued to take place before the Persian New Year.
Shopping malls in Qom will remain closed to visitors until 16 March 2020.In February, Iran was named as the epicenter of the outbreak, second only to China.
Following a crackdown on the outbreak in Iran, more than a dozen countries have exported cases to Iran as of February 28, showing the spread of the epidemic to be higher than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government.
The Iranian parliament suspends its session.Twenty-three of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to release those detained for peacefully expressing their dissent without any prior conditions, and to release the other detainees they detained temporarily.
The risk of spreading the virus is likely to be higher in closed facilities where there is a lack of adequate medical care, such as in residential facilities.
On 15 March, Iranian authorities reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the start of the pandemic.

The exact mortality rate of the disease and the rate of herd immunity are determined by the results of these tests.
With limited testing, no country has reliable data on the spread of the pandemic in its population since March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and the way in which testing is carried out varies widely across countries.
This number also appears to have a significant impact on the reported cases of death, as in some countries it appears to be higher than estimated.
Using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed using a variety of methods, including respiratory samples, nasopharyngeal swabs, or stool samples.
Results will be available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed by Gororo Swab was positive in the first weeks of the disease.
The infection can spread to the throat, where the virus spreads to the lungs.
Infected people who have been tested for the second week, a suction catheter or a suction catheter (a suction) can be used as a sample material for the inhalation of respiratory tract.
One of the first trials was conducted in Berlin at the Charité in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which resulted in 250,000 kits being distributed by the World Health Organization.
The United Kingdom developed the test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
" It seeks the ""E"" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specifically for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the companies that received the emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Health Administration for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a true RT-PCR test panel for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to the public health community through the Global Integrated Healthcare Initiative".
One of the three most extreme genetic tests had inconclusive results due to incorrect reagents and a test condition disruption at the CDC in Atlanta that resulted in an average of fewer than 100 tests being successfully conducted daily throughout January 2020.
Testing using the AKT was not considered credible until February 28, 2020, after which state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.US Commercial Laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp has announced the national presence of COVID-19 tests conducted in RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also launched a nationwide COVID-19 test on March 9, 2020.
No limitation of numbers has been announced; sampling and processing must be done according to CDC criteria.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed by the state's Virology and Biotechnology Research Center VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was approved by the Federal Office of Health Care Services.On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a positive test for COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can perform a high volume of tests in 3.5 hours, allowing a machine to perform 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for tests on Abbott's m2000 system; similar authorizations were granted to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received a similar EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA has approved the use of isothermal nucleic acid imaging technology as a test alternative to PCR.
Since no continuous temperature change is required, these methods provide positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in less than 13 minutes.
Currently, 18,000 of Abbott's U.S. machines are expected to perform 50,000 tests per day.Tests that use monoclonal antibodies to bind to the novel coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) are being developed in Taiwan, and tests such as rapid influenza tests are expected to be performed in 15 to 20 minutes.
The March 2020 Literature Review noted that "oral cardiac radiographs are less able to detect the disease in the early stages of the disease, but CT [computed tomography] can detect it even before symptoms develop".
Its typical features seen in CT are a bilateral multilobular grass-like fold to a distant, asymmetric posterior part of the scalp.
Subplural thickening, regrowth and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
In a study comparing PCR to CT at the origin of the current Wuhan pandemic, CT was found to be more effective than PCR in diagnosing disease, but, in any case, it did not identify any disease; most of its scans were similar to pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology stated that "CT chemistry should not be the first line of treatment for COVID-19".As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR chemistry as the first line of treatment for the pandemic".
The immune system's response to attack this disease involves the production of IgM and IgG antibodies.
These are used to detect the infection 7 days or so after the onset of symptoms, to confirm that they are not infected, and to monitor the general population.Tests are performed in central laboratories (CLT) or point of care testing (PoCT).
High-throughput automated systems in most clinical laboratories can perform these tests, but their availability may be limited by the complexity of the system instructions.
Although serum samples are used to monitor immunity, CLT is the most commonly used blood sample.
A blood sample for PoCT is usually administered by injection into the skin.
As an extraction step, PCR methods do not require a pre-test.On March 26, 2020, the FDA informed the 29 companies that notified the agency that they had been asked, and therefore could now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for emergency use.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics received approval for their test kit from Epitope Diagnostics, which uses IgG in blood samples to detect IgA antibodies against the virus.
The test has a capacity to test several hundred samples in a matter of hours, and is therefore much faster than the standard viral RNA PCR test.
These antibodies are usually produced 14 days after the infection is detected.In early April, the UK confirmed that the antibody kits they had developed were not suitable for use.
"Hong Kong developed a method whereby suspected persons could stay at home, "the Emergency Department would provide a test tube to the patient, "and the results would be known later.The British NHS said it would start a method of home storage of suspected cases, including testing for COVID-19 in vehicles and cocaine-free services, and taking samples from healthcare professionals in the pre-hospital setting to reduce the risk of transmission when patients arrive at the hospital or to reduce the risk of infection by ambulances bringing patients".
On-street testing facilities have enabled South Korea to conduct more rapid and robust tests than any other country in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance announced on March 2 that it will have the capacity to perform 12,000 tests per day via mobile systems, and 10,700 tests in the last few weeks.
If the test is prescribed by a doctor, the cost will be covered by the health insurance.
Germany has a general requirement of 160,000 tests per week, according to the president of the Robert Koch Institute.
Since March 19, vehicle inspections have been conducted in many cities.
As of 26 March 2020, no general testing in Germany is known, as only positive tests are reported.
"The first laboratory tests were conducted from the calendar week of 12/2020, with a total of 483,295 samples tested as of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Israel, the Research Institute of the Technion, and Rambam Hospital tested a method to combine samples from 64 patients, mixing the samples and only testing if the treated samples tested positive.In the 2000sq-meter, the pioneering laboratory ""Huo-Yan"" (Chinese: "Yan-Yan", or "Fire Eye") celebrated the 5th anniversary of BGI, celebrating over 10,000 samples in 2020".
The building took 5 days to be constructed, as shown by BGI founder Wang Jian.Hubei's testing capacity would have been 47% higher if it had not been for this improvement, and the cost of surveillance and quarantine would have been doubled.
The Wuhan laboratory was followed by the Huo-Yan laboratories of Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of 4 March 2020, daily testing totaled 50,000 tests per day.The design proposed by Origami Testing, a small source, allows testing of just 93 tests on samples from 1122 COVID-19 patients.These standardized designs can be performed in smaller labs without the assistance of a robotic fluid extractor.
In March, there was a major push to conduct multiple investigations into the EU's and the UK's regent deficiencies and inadequacies.
This led the authors to develop a sample preparation protocol that included the use of RNA genomes to enhance the detection of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes.On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported that it had tested more people for coronavirus than any other country, and that it had the same number of people tested for the same disease.
"It is a collaboration between the in-car service, the demographic scale from the Group 42 laboratory and the BGI (based on China's "Huo-Yan" randomized controlled trial)".
Built in 14 days, the lab can process tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests in a single day, the first time it has been operated outside of China.
Test mandates comparing different genetic aspects of the coronavirus have been issued in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization welcomes German kit manufacturers who are exporting to low-income countries that are not able to produce themselves.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020, which delayed testing because the disease control protocol developed by the United States was not available until 28 January.China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits as required by medical professionals.
In comparison, experts say South Korea's large-scale testing kit has slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing facilities, especially at the Glee laboratories, have been built up over the years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for testing programs to be effective in reducing COVID-19.Due to the widespread spread of the virus, hundreds of thousands of individual tests have been conducted in U.S. laboratories, and the shortage of supplies of swabs and chemical reagents, high testing questions are being raised.
In March 2020, China reported a malfunction in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "problems"; the government subsequently lifted a bureaucratic ban on the testing of human immunotherapy.Spain purchased the test kits from China's Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd and confirmed that the results were safe.
The company said the unsatisfactory results could be due to problems with the sample assembly or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry of Health banned the use of kits with false results, and other test kits supplied by Shenzhen Bioeasy were used.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China were found to be false.Slovakia imported 1.2 million kits from China and found them to be unreliable.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that this be dumped into the Danube.Ateş Kara said that the Turkish Ministry of Health had a "high error rate" for the test kits it had bought from China and "did not use them".UK reported that 3.5 million test kits were imported from China in early April 2020 but were not used for their intended purpose.
Testing, detection of positive results and follow-up of people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 are showing positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted two rounds of tests on 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of the positive test results are asymptomatic, and all cases detected are suspected.
By preventing travel to the coma, this can prevent new infections.
With strong immigration controls, travel bans, testing and quarantines, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic was relatively low in Singapore compared to other developing countries, with the unnecessary closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Most of the preparations have been cancelled, and Singapore began urging residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools were closed for the time being after the holiday break on March 23.
Several other countries managed to contain the outbreak with strict surveillance, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but not as significantly with lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics show that countries with high testing rates have lower mortality rates compared to death rates, as these countries are able to differentiate between people with mild and no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises that countries without testing facilities and with national laboratories that have expertise in COVID-19 should send the initial five positive and ten negative COVID-19 test results to the 16 WHO referral laboratories.
Of the 16 test centers, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the order of the % of positive tests is determined by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only people who come to the hospital has a higher percentage of people who test positive than a country that tests all of its citizens, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not, all other things being equal.
Hand washing (or hand sanitizing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning your hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances from your hands.
" Washing hands with soap and water at ""critical times"" reduces the transmission of many diseases, such as tuberculosis and cholera, which are diseases that are transmitted from the mouth to the anus by the roadside".
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as eye, nose, or mouth (for example, mucous membranes), if they do not wash their hands before touching them.
The five most important times of the day when you need to wash your hands with soap are: before and after you wash, after you wash your baby's diaper or diaper, before you feed your baby, before you eat, before you prepare food, and after you eat meat, fish, and milk.
If you do not have access to water and soap, you can wash your hands with a professional hand sanitizer.
before, during, and after preparing food.
before and after caring for a sick person.
A piece of used baby diaper after changing or repairing.
Snoring, coughing, or wheezing behind your nose.
after handling, feeding, or handling animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or receiving medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
Hand washing is the main health care measure to keep hands clean of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially useful for people handling food or those working in the medical field, but it is also useful for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronaviruses, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of diarrheal infections; and reducing respiratory infections.
Reducing the death rate of home births.
A 2013 study found that even small improvements in hand washing routine resulted in height problems in children under five.
In tropical countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate by 50%.
Handwashing is recommended to reduce the risk of infection by three times, compared to providing sanitation in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap and water is a major factor in reducing the risk of diarrheal disease by 48%. Handwashing with soap and water is the most effective way to prevent diarrheal and respiratory infections, including diarrhea, in the home, community and community.
Pneumonia, severe ARI, is the number one killer of children under five years of age, claiming up to 1.8 million lives a year.
3.5 million children die from diarrhoea and pneumonia every year.
UNICEF says that vaccination and treatment, along with hand washing with soapy water before eating and using the toilet after eating, can save lives, halve the number of infections and reduce deaths from respiratory diseases.
Hand washing is often combined with other hygiene practices such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing your hands also protects against infectious disease, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
The small critical effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can dry the skin and lead to skin rashes.
A 2012 Danish study found that frequent hand washing can lead to conditions such as dry skin eczema or hand dermatitis, which are common in healthcare workers.
Repeatedly washing your hands is considered a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
To reduce the risk of transmission of the disease to the mouth and mouth, there are five main handwashing sessions that should be followed daily: after using the toilet (after using the toilet, flushing), after changing the baby's diaper (after changing the diapers), before feeding the children, before and after eating, or preparing meat, fish, or milk.
Hand washing techniques should be used in other situations to prevent transmission of infection, including before and after wound care; after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal excrement or handling animals; and after defecation.
In many countries, low-quality hand washing with soap and water is common.
A handwashing survey in 2015 was conducted in 54 countries, with an average of 38.7% of households using handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States was in the middle at 77%, and China had the lowest rate at 23%. Various cultural change methods have been used to promote the practice of handwashing with soap in the border areas.
"The "Health Care Decision Program" implemented by the Education Department is an example of a large scale initiative to strengthen children's health and education in the Philippines".
The main objective of the national program is to provide daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoride tooth brushing twice a year.
It has also been successfully used in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is accomplished by mixing soap and detergent with water.
The main function of soap and detergents is to reduce waste and increase the availability of detergents.
Water alone is not a good cleanser, because fats and proteins, the very soil of life, are not washed by water alone.
However, cleaning, supported by reasonable water content, is not enough.
Dry soaps, by their nature of frequent use, can retain bacteria from the previous use.
Many studies have shown that the spread of bacteria from contaminated soil is limited because the bacteria are destroyed by the soil.
"The CDC has so far recommended that "liquid soap should be used without touching hands".
Antibacterial soaps are designed to be passed around by the health-conscious population.
To date, there is no evidence to support the efficacy of the use of these recommended antiseptics or disinfectants for naturally occurring antibiotic resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many people tolerate.
Therefore, antibiotic-resistant steroids may not be as effective as they should be, even if they are not selected by antibacterial soaps.
In addition to the skin protection agents, this complex may contain complex formulations of acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) such as pH stabilizers, antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and additional skin conditioners (alloy vera, vitamins, methanol, vegetable extracts).The overall strength of the product from Oregon Public Health Care University is that the soap is designed for use in the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections and is superior to other soap products.
The hot water you use to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly in the human body at fever (37 °C).
However, fresh, soapy water is more effective at removing bacteria than cold, soapy water and natural oils.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water is not effective in reducing the number of microbes in the hand.
Hand sanitizers or hand antiseptics are water-free hand washing agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (alcoholic hand sanitizer, antiseptic hand sanitizer, or sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most isopyl alcohols or ethanol are gelled with a thickening agent such as carbomers (acrylic acid polymers), or are humicantanthants such as gelling agents and liquids, or are coated to reduce the thickening effect of the alcohol.
The use of hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity. However, hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol content are effective disinfectants.
It is also effective against alcohol-containing sanitizer bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA for VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers with a 70% alcohol content kill 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of application (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) and 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria after 1 minute of application. Hand sanitizers are effective against bacteria but not as effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Use a sufficient amount of hand antiseptic or alcohol to wipe your hands or both hands.
Both hands, forearms and middle fingers should be dry with the liquid, gel or gel for 30 seconds.
Finger tips should be washed thoroughly, with both hands touching the palm. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands over sanitiser platforms, especially if hands have visible dirt.
The main advantage of these agents is that they are easy to use and kill microorganisms quickly; however, they are not a substitute for proper hand washing and the availability of soap and water.
Repeated use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can result in dry skin, so the skin should be treated with formula and/or detergents.
The metabolic effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other compounds to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-containing sanitizers have been shown to have a lower incidence of skin irritation and inflammation compared to soaps and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic dermatitis, urethral urethritis syndrome and hyperresponsiveness to alcohol are associated with the overuse of alcohol supplements.
Comparison of washing with soap and water to reduce the development of dermatitis of the eye.
Regardless of their effectiveness, non-aqueous agents cannot disinfect organic material on hands, they can only be used to decontaminate.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water in preventing the transmission of many pathogens, because pathogens are more persistent on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on their ingredients and formulation, and has historically been the most effective for both low-alcohol and alcohol-containing hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and consistent antimicrobial activity against alcohol, but its effectiveness has decreased after repeated use, and it can cause adverse effects on the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap, so instead they use a pot or a sandbag.
Using a toilet or sand is better than using water, but not as effective as soap.
The soil or soil may be contaminated with microorganisms, which is not a threat to the spread of the virus, but a way to reduce its spread.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, including water, because it is alkaline and forms a softener.
The World Health Organization suggests that in healthcare where soap is not available, we can use either sand or plaster as a soap substitute.
The US Centers for Disease Control recommends the following hand-washing techniques to reduce the spread of the disease:
wash your hands with warm or cool water.
Running water is collected because standing basins can be added, the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands thoroughly with plenty of soap, including the soles of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap repels germs from the skin, and studies show that people are more likely to bathe with soap than with water.
If not, hold it for 20 seconds.
Hand washing promotes expansion, helps remove germs from the skin, and prolonged hand washing eliminates many germs.
wash your hands with water from a stream.
The hands may be placed on the cleaning basin.
Clean your hands with a dry towel or a blow-dryer.
Dirty and dirty hands are prone to staining. The most commonly missed parts of the hands are the thumb, the wrist, the space between the fingers, and the inner surface of the hand.
Artificial leaves and painted leaves can hold microorganisms.
Hand lotion is recommended to protect hands from dryness as it increases the risk of transmission of dry skin disease.
"Various low-cost hand sanitizers can be introduced to enhance hand washing when coffee and/or soap are not available, for example, by imitating or using water from a suspended jar and/or using hand sanitizers if necessary in flood-prone countries. Water storage solutions are available for situations with expensive water supply (such as schools or rural areas in flood-prone countries), such as "tippy-taps" and low-cost hand sanitizers".
tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a corded jug to tap water and soap into your hand by simply walking.
Proper handwashing is an essential part of hand hygiene procedures, but there is controversy over handwashing procedures in public toilets.
Several studies have shown that paper towels are more effective than electric handhelds.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the European Soft Symposium, compared the cleanliness of paper towels with that of hot-air hand-held towels and modern jet-air towels.
Washing hands and using a hot air dryer, overall bacterial counts were 194% higher on finger pads and 254% higher on the palms.
The risk of eliminating the overall median bacterial load of a hand jet is 42% for finger pads and 15% for hand soles.
After washing your hands with a paper towel, the overall bacterial load on the finger pads was reduced by 76% and on the palm of the hand by 77%.
The jet-air platform, which ejects air from the unit at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of lifting microorganisms from the hands and other bathroom surfaces, and can cover up to 2 meters around the bathroom.
The fresh air of the hand platform spreads microorganisms about 0.25 meters from the platform.
Paper towels have not been found to transmit microorganisms to the hands.A 2005 study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt showed a different method of hand washing.
The following changes in bacterial mass were observed after hand washing:
There are many different types of hand towels; hand towels have been compared to paper towels.
It is recommended to wash hands with a hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in preventing the spread of disease in hospitals (in 1846).
Electronic devices are available to remind hospital staff to wash their hands.
One study found a reduced infection rate with their use.
If you have a medical condition, wash your hands for 15 seconds, then wash each part of your hand with plenty of soap and water or gel.
Hands should be held together with fingers crossed.
If there are residues under your fingers, you can use a brush wheel to remove them.
It is important to spread germs properly and to wipe your hands with a dry towel, as germs can be trapped in the water in your hands.
After rolling, use the paper towel to turn off the water (and if necessary, open a locked door).
This will help your hands to avoid re-infecting the areas by replacing them.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to prevent the spread of germs and prevent transmission to others.
In New England, the Journal of Medicine reported that in most medical settings, lack of hand hygiene is unacceptable, and that many doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before treating patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce catheter-associated blood vessel infection by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has developed standard hand washing and hand stretching procedures in health care units.
The incomplete hand hygiene guidelines issued by the organizations are available for public viewing on their websites.
A review of this was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may be hand hygiene labelled and labelled, if required by legal requirements.
The World Health Organization has defined "five stages" of hand washing:
The blood/body fluids are then drained
Before the disease, work, and
"After patient care, the use of antiseptic chemicals in soap ("therapeutic" or "anti-microbial" soaps) reduces the risk of handwashing".
Such a lethal measure could be used before surgery or in cases where antibiotic resistant organisms are more common.For surgery, a person's hand is 'washed', and any waste that may be discharged by touching hands is removed, and a certain amount of chlorhexidine or iodine is applied, with sterile towels for drying hands, a sterile brush for washing and other sterile devices for under-the-counter cleaning.
All the barriers must be removed.
This method requires washing your hands from the wrist to the elbow for a maximum of 2×6 minutes.
It is not necessary to stand for long periods (10 minutes).
Care should be taken to avoid water getting into the hands if the upper arm is wet.
After you have showered, wash your hands with a sterile dry towel and remove your surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash your hands before and after contact with a sick person or to use antiseptic.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, a major benefit of hand hygiene was found in the first 20% of washed hands, and an increase in hand washing frequency of over 35% was observed.
Regular hand soap washing has more than three times the chance of transmitting bacterial infections to food compared to antibacterial soap washing.Alcohol-containing hand soap reduces the bacterial resistance of antibacterial soap by 26% compared to washing your hands for 30 seconds with an antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap from alcohol-containing hand sanitizers are best for removing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium from hands.Hand hygiene practices in health care facilities may include teaching staff about hand washing, introducing alcohol-containing hand sanitizers, and providing written and oral reminders to staff.
Further studies are needed to determine which of these treatments are most effective.
In tropical countries, hand washing with soap is considered a cost-effective and essential tool for good health and nutrition.
However, the lack of water, soap or hand washing equipment and the shortage of supplies at home, school and workplace make it difficult to develop universal hand washing practices.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there is a shortage of hand-washing taps in the backyards, although some rural communities are building their own toilets.
However, low handwashing rates are the result of poor hygiene, not lack of soap and water.
Enforcing hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and create long-term public hand washing habits.
In order for this to work properly, it is important to control and monitor.
"A systematic review of 70 studies showed that environmental approaches to hand washing were best in LMICs, while social market approaches were not.The school hand washing model ""Three Star Approach"" was simplified by UNICEF for schools, offering a five-step method to help students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene elements".
If a lower standard is met, schools may be rated from one to three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be used as a hand washing promotion campaign to reduce the incidence of the disease and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day campaign is trying to bring about a change in behavior.Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus, UNICEF has encouraged the creation of handwashing emojis.
One study evaluated the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in tropical countries in relation to the cessation of DALYs.
However, one study found that washing hands with soap is cost effective compared to other water and hygiene methods.
"The health benefits of hand washing in humans, especially in vulnerable situations such as mothers who are about to give birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, were first recognized in the mid-19th century by two founders of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Tangele, the English "father of modern hand washing".
At the time, many people believed that the infections were caused by a parasite called Miasmas.
In 1980, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was encouraged by the outbreak of foodborne and health-related infections to improve hand hygiene as the primary means of prevention of the infection.
The Swine Flu pandemic of 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
"For example, posters with the slogan ""Correct hand washing technique"" are hung next to public toilets and washbasins in offices in Berlin and German airports".
"The phrase ""wash your hands until they're dry"" refers to the reluctance to take responsibility for the usefulness of anything".
The term originates from the biblical Gospel of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but the term has been widely used in English-speaking society.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands forcibly to cleanse herself of her guilt for the crime she committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
People are found to wash their hands more often than others when they remember or think about doing something disorderly, and to place more emphasis on hand sanitizer than others.
"Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such an act are limited in their ability to engage in other ""safe"" acts of self-defense, such as volunteering".
Hand washing is a ritual and symbolism of religions. The ritual of washing hands, which is simply washing hands with water without soap, is a practice of many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, Tewahluq, Neti Yadaim Judaism, La'abah, Christianity, and Islam. Religions also recommend hand washing, especially for certain rituals.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require that you wash your hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam also encourage hand washing before eating.

COVID-19 hazard controls in the workplace include workplace safety and risk control measures to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Effective workplace risk controls depend on the type of workplace and workplace, the source of exposure, the severity of the environment, and the factors that may be exposing people to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure occupations are those occupations that require minimal contact with people or equipment, and that require basic infection prevention measures, such as hand washing, keeping workers indoors when they are sick, respiratory protocols, and cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
Workplaces with a high risk of exposure include those that require frequent direct contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, but may be excluded due to the ongoing community pandemic or international travel.
This includes working with the general population such as schools, high-density workplaces, and some high-density retail establishments.
Risk control teams, in addition to the basic infection prevention measures, should use high-ventilation air conditioners, respiratory masks and personal protective equipment if any person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHA said that health care and funeral workers exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients are at high risk of exposure, if they are conducting aerosol production tests, or if they are collecting samples of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, and their immunity is increased.
The risk management of these workers also includes engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation units, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have many implications for the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because they are sick, have to care for others, or are afraid of being confronted.
Business practices can change in two ways: in terms of the availability of what they need and how they get what they need (such as shopping at odd hours or getting services from your car).
Finally, it is possible to cut off imports from countries that have been severely affected by COVID-19.Infectious disease preparedness and response plans can help to coordinate immunization efforts.
The indicators show the risk factors associated with workplaces and occupations, including sources of exposure, home and community settings, and the risk factors associated with certain occupations, such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
To control the situation that may arise during the outbreak, the government has put in place a number of measures to identify the risk and the risk factors.
The timing of the response to infectious diseases and the response time is subject to national and sub-national recommendations.
The goals of the pandemic response include reducing staff turnover, treating people who are vulnerable to adverse health outcomes, protecting business operations, and mitigating potential adverse impacts in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the area of the business affects the response to the outbreak.
Pre-accident control is often associated with health insurance and is the basis for a complex group risk control strategy.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the best controls are engineering controls, continuous administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls are the most cost-effective solution for the protection of workers from work-related hazards without affecting the personal characteristics of the employee.
Administrative controls are changes in the policy of a business or manufacturing company that require action by the employee or supervisor.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less expensive compared to engineering and administrative equipment, but some of the improvements can be used for protection.
All personal protective equipment is considered to be hazardous to the worker if it is properly installed and used (for example, breathing apparatus), is properly maintained, regularly inspected, maintained, modified, and removed as necessary, and is kept clean and properly installed to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations are those with a low risk of exposure to hazardous substances, such as people and machinery.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent hand washing with soap and water, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, adhering to respiratory rules and procedures for building and construction, providing soft and sanitary seals, extending the telecommunications limitation system to shift systems where necessary, encouraging workers to avoid using other people's equipment and devices, maintaining a high level of daily cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Early detection and isolation of individuals with the infection from employees, customers, visitors and other people in the workplace is a critical step in preventing the spread of the disease.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory illness stay at home for up to 24 hours without fever, symptoms of fever, other symptoms, and any anti-inflammatory medication, and that sick leave policies be implemented in a manner that allows employees to treat family members at home, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, vulnerable occupations are those occupations that require people to be within six feet (1.8 m) of an unknown or suspected COVID-19 patient, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission at a business location, or travel to countries with widespread COVID-19 transmission, frequently or in close contact.
This includes the use of equipment and services to protect workers from exposure, such as schools, workplaces with high population density and some high-volume retail locations.This includes the use of air conditioners with high exposure and engineering controls by high exposure groups and above, the use of ventilation and floor cleaning equipment and physical barriers such as clear plastic containers, and the use of a car seat for training and transportation.This includes the use of equipment and services to protect workers from exposure and to protect them from exposure, the use of personal protective equipment and equipment to protect workers from exposure to COVID-19 and other aspects of workplace hazards such as the management of meetings and meetings, the use of personal protective equipment and equipment to protect workers from COVID-19 and the development of a culture of safety, and the use of safety equipment to protect workers from COVID-19 and other workplace hazards, and the use of workplace safety measures such as the use of COVID-19 screening devices and other measures to ensure that workers are protected from exposure to COVID-19 and other aspects of workplace hazards.
These high-risk workers do not require the use of group respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate precautions for the safety of the crew and passengers include keeping the sick person 6 feet away from others and providing the sick person with a face and mask, and covering the nose and mouth with a soft cloth during the flight.
Cabin crews should use medical gloves that can be used and discarded when caring for a sick passenger or when in an area where human fluids may have been contaminated, and personal protective equipment should be used if the passenger has a fever, persistent fever, or respiratory problems.
Bags and other items that could be used for disinfection must be disposed of in a bio-safe bag, contaminated areas must be cleaned and disinfected, and commercial shipping, cruise ships and other passenger vessels must be inspected for hazard control, including the handling of illness, identifying the victim, and identifying medical personnel on board if anyone has fever or other symptoms.
In general, medical vaccinations should be performed in the quarantine cabin of the individual.Schools and child care facilities, regardless of community contact, should be closed until the child is cleaned and disinfected.
If there is low or moderate community transmission, physical distancing measures should be implemented such as field trips, meetings and other large gatherings, such as physical fitness classes or choir classes, or the distribution of meals in cafes, by widening the gap between the stalls, by decreasing the hours of entry and exit, by reducing non-essential visitors, and by using a special treatment area for children with symptoms such as influenza.
If there is a community outbreak, in addition to social distancing measures, schools may be required to remain closed for an extended period of time.The law enforcement community has been able to carry out daily activities, and the direct health risk is considered low by the CDC.
For people who are suspected of having COVID-19 and have been confirmed to have the disease, the same rules should be followed by law enforcement agencies, including the use of medical professionals, including the use of medical equipment.
In the event of an emergency close contact, personnel should clean and disinfect their compulsory vaccines and equipment using a household detergent or wipe before reusing them, and follow standard guidelines for the disposal and handling of used PPE and clothing for loading.
OSHA reports that some health care and funeral workers are at a higher risk of being injured.
Occupations with a high exposure risk include healthcare supply, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 susceptibility.
Aerosol workers are especially vulnerable if they are conducting tests or collecting samples from suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-based procedures include intubation, dialysis, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests, or invasive sampling.
Funeral services with a high risk of infection are those that prepare corpses for people suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19; these are more likely to be infected if they conduct an autopsy.In addition, engineering controls, including the isolation of those who have been confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19, are also implemented by aerosol production procedures.
Specially designed negative ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and funeral facilities.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that COVID-19 patients who come to the clinic should be isolated, especially if they are not suspected of having COVID-19.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for people who work in a room with a known SARS-CoV-2 infection, suspected persons, and those who work in aerosol testing.
In the United States, face masks with a NIOSH-approved N95 filter or better are used in general, documented respiratory protection programs, including adequate testing, training, and clinical trials.
Other respirators provide better protection and better comfort for the worker.WHO does not recommend full face masks, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not a fluid-borne one.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for people who are sick.
WHO recommends that people who collect, conceal, or transport respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients wear surgical masks, eyeglasses, or face coverings, gloves, and gloves.
If aerosol-producing tests are to be performed, the surgical mask should be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
With global supply of PPE in short supply, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, using physical separators as clear mirrors, allowing only people with direct care to be admitted to COVID-19; using PPE only when it is strictly necessary; continuing to use PPE when it is not necessary for the care of several patients with the same condition; and controlling and coordinating the PPE supply chain; and emphasizing the use of masks by people without symptoms.

The Winnipeg Line: [COVID-19] preparing for the future by shining a light on the challenge
Date and time: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: No rights reserved
This month we have found ourselves in a difficult situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear demonstration of our global solidarity and responsibility.
We have no role models for your petitions, but we know that our main response to global compassion, cooperation and community building is to create a heart of the organization.
The camaraderie and interaction we have seen through emails, calls and chats among our users proves that we have had the opportunity to work with some of the most amazing people.
I am very happy to consider all of you as my employees.
Last week, someone shared a compliment about our work.
It reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to subscribe to Wikipedia at this time, and it is a powerful sign that this vital online resource is becoming available to everyone.
This helps your business succeed, keeps our sites running, or our tools running, or keeps our community safe.
The world needs Wikipedia's information more than ever.
It's time that not only what we do, but how we do it, has a meaningful impact on the world.
In light of the need for this mission and the challenges it faces, we will work together to make some tangible changes in the way it operates starting next week.
I was so excited to see the brothers and sisters there.
Robyn said earlier, the c-team had met to discuss our process and plan for the coming days and months.
In this discussion, we considered what we thought was the appropriate response to our situation and what we should do to ensure the continuity of the organization at this time.
With great anxiety, we decided to end our mission and help out for a long time.
If you want to call back, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our average working hours are 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not celebrating - if you can work extra hours, this mission could be useful to you.
However, in a world where it's hard to get by, whether it's taking care of loved ones, doing groceries, or going to the doctor, your safety is our priority.
We are not keeping track of your time
Do not go to work if you are sick.
This is something that can be understood without saying it, but we have to say it.
Need sick days or PTO - Tell your manager and help your team to schedule their days and make plans to ensure that workplaces are occupied.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, let Bryan know about T&C Ops, and T&C will help you get help and your case will be taken care of by management.)
The hourly workers will be paid in full.
We will honor our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid according to the hours worked in normal conditions.
This includes if you are ill and unable to go to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to escape the stress of our world.
Our work can be very productive, especially in times like this.
Now, this is about taking care of your own back.
We ask that you speak with your manager, so that we know what to expect.
Some tasks are assigned as priority.
There are a few things that we should continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fund Support teams (among others) have been found to be doing critical work requiring additional assistance.
We will begin to shift our focus to meet current goals and to help with what is important to our mission.
There is much for all of us to do, and we will focus on the projects that are most important.
It doesn't hurt to slow down now.
We have not been asked to go twice as often as this pandemic has passed.
you are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines.
We accept that things have changed, and work to set new goals and deadlines if necessary.
What is happening to the APP?
To adapt to this new environment and to reduce daily working hours, we are considering a temporary reduction of the limitation period, which is part of our 2020-2021 annual target.
Our goal is to propose a 2019-2020 work-based budget that will give critical workers enough time to prioritize their care, care and care for loved ones, and prepare for the next few weeks when they may want to adjust their schedules and work.
This reduction in the time limit for this position significantly reduces the workload and stress across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and, once approved, will update it in our next steps regarding delegates and groups.
Thank you APP Team for your leadership.
Office environment, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our co-founders may have tested positive for COVID-19.
However, as a precaution, the team of the anti-virus unit has been sent to the San Francisco office to disinfect the premises.
They used hospital-grade anti-virus to disinfect all contact areas, including the lobby and the elevator buckets to our clinic.
The building is in the process of developing its own security staff to provide security support to its employees.
We are confident that our office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our DC office is based at WeWork, and has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
As of last week, our DC office has implemented a full-length layout with the San Francisco Shire.
Like some of our NYC-based designers, we had been discussing hiring a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
They believe that our long-term space missions are a threat, and they would like to offer some advice:
The length of the meetings should be no more than one or two hours
If special arrangements are required, consider how they can be broken down into specific days.
Identify meetings, schedule them, and send reading material in advance.
Set this video as the default to enable live connections and contacts with Google Docs and Zoom.
There are guidelines for each meeting, someone controls the chat and keeps track of the list of speakers, and someone takes notes (or is jointly notified).
If you need a headsets, please email tech support.
Use your safety net to feed yourself.
Be sure to talk to your followers about the activities they are sharing on Slack on the #remoties channel.
This HR operation team is monitoring the growth of ergonomics across the foundation, and supporting the webinar-based ergonomics.
Last week, we asked all Wikimedia-supported communities to suspend public events such as editathons until the WHO declared the pandemic over.
We want to let them know that we understand that this cancellation request or other restrictions will make it impossible for them to obtain the license we have agreed to, and that no one will be punished for delaying or improving these requests.
We will be following Wikimania's additional guidelines and other regional and thematic community conferences next week.
The global community is in mourning and in shock, and people are feeling relieved to be able to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia Commons
In addition, CRT is working on creating a Meta-Wiki page to provide a place for the community to monitor its health and track our interactions with them.
The presence of cases of COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to attend additional meetings, answer your questions, and have time to meet with you personally.
We are all in this together and we must help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive this information via email, and other important COVID-19-related information, on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all this information in one place.
We are working to continue our contacts with staff in countries that are currently experiencing severe use.
Please feel free to contact and work with CRT regarding travel, arrangements, major business events, or cover letter, or any other assistance you may need.
We are here to provide you with support and help as needed.
If you have a confidential or embarrassing issue, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
These changes should not be seen as reducing our work and our responsibilities.
In fact, they suggest that in the meantime, our work and our roles will have to change more than ever.
These are the steps that we think can help us to help ourselves and work together, to give our movement the support it needs, and to help the world with their help.
Our work will be done until the time comes.
From now on, we will support each other and create the necessary framework for the next week and the months ahead.
we expect all of you to work to make this happen, so that you can provide for yourselves and your families, and that you will find yourselves able to provide for yourselves when the necessities are provided.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the remaining leadership teams (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme found in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and intestinal tract.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the concentration of angiotensin-II and increasing angiospermins (α) 1-7.This makes it a promising drug for treating cardiovascular disease.ACE2 also serves as a portal to cells for some coronaviruses.
In humans, the enzyme is often called hACE2deficient.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme found in endothelial and other tissues.
ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collector and renal amino acid transporter domains.
ACE2 is a type I receptor protein, which is an active enzyme that is predominantly expressed in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular ACE2 domain is cut from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shadase, the resulting protein is transported to the blood vessels and then removed by the shunt.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is specifically associated with the type II alveolar cells of the lung, the endocyte of the pancreas, the endothelial cells of the arterial veins, the cells of the arterial capillaries, and the cell membranes of the valves of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, the striatum, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to regulate ACE.
ACE is a precursor of angiotensin I, which is a hormone that is secreted by angiotensin II into the bloodstream.
ACE2 in turn hydrolyzes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), which is also known as H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH.
ACE2 can synthesize various peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 regulates the activity of the neutral transporter amino-acid SLC6A19 and is associated with heart failure.
As a protein recombinant, ACEI 2 is the main binding site for both HCoV-NL63 and several other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV (for the SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (for the COVID-19 virus).
Specifically, the protein spike of SARS-CoV S1 and SARS-CoV2 is formed by the association of the virus and the enzyme to the endosome in the nucleus of the cell, and the endosynthesis and translation of the enzyme to the ACE2 enzyme domain in the nucleus of the cell.
This interaction requires the serine protein transporter TMPRSS2 to prime the S protein, and the potential therapeutic use of this protein is being investigated.
However, many experts and regulators recommend the use of an ACE inhibitor to treat ARB to maintain its efficacy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, showed that ""the use of ACE inhibitors reduced the risk of developing pneumonia by 34% compared to controls""".
"Further, ""the risk of developing pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at risk of developing severe pneumonia, especially in those at risk of stroke and heart failure".
Although the results suggested that the use of ACE inhibitors to reduce pneumonia was associated with a decreased risk of death from pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novel treatment for acute lung injury, improving pulmonary hypodynamics and oxygen saturation in patients with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 is about 10 hours, and the duration of action is less than 30 minutes, in addition to the 24-hour duration of action.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients who are resistant to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) in patients with high levels of angiotensin II. rhACE2 has been demonstrated in clinical trials for the treatment of severe respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 applications are mobile phone applications for contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals who may have been in contact with an infected individual at the same time.
In some states and jurisdictions, many apps have been blocked or removed with official government support.
Several initiatives have been developed to develop applications to help monitor communications.
Methods based on the specific geographic location of users are considered to be a security risk.
Using signals to access other Bluetooth mobile phones with fewer user options.
On April 10, 2020, Google said that it was working with Apple to bring a Bluetooth-based app directly to the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has partnered with Alipay to launch an app that allows citizens to report contact with a person who has COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities.Trace_ToGether is used in Singapore.
"The application was developed by the local IT community and donated to the government and is open to the public.It is a Bluetooth-based application launched by North Macedonia with the slogan "StopKorona!" to identify contacts of the infected person and provide a rapid response to health professionals".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Communications and Technology.
As of April 14, 2020, apps were pending approval by Google Play Store and Apple Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that it would be phasing out the development of a mobile app within weeks. Similar apps are planned in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand are considering using the BlueTrace protocol for the Singaporean TraceTogether app.Russia is testing a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed several practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false positives and reduced efficiency when the application is used in a limited segment of the population.
"To combat the spread of malicious or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has restricted the organizations it allows to upload apps related to the coronavirus to the App Store, allowing only ""public"" or trusted organizations".
Google and Amazon have introduced footprints.
Gosgás expressed concern about the risks of using the coronavirus to create a pandemic, especially after the pandemic.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organization has identified eight conditions for government projects:
The monitoring must be legal, effective and proportionate.
The measures of surveillance and camera surveillance are necessary to clarify the post-election confusion.
The use of the data will be limited to COVID-19 only.
Information security and privacy should be protected and safeguarded by putting them on the agenda.
The digital integrity must be protected from discrimination and harassment.
any sharing of data with a third party shall be legally prohibited;
Citizens should have the right to protection against and response to abuses;
"Significant participation of all relevant stakeholders, public health experts and stakeholder groups is needed.The German Keio Computer Laboratory (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued a checklist".
The current Google/Apple agreement is intended to address the ongoing security issues by removing the monitoring and monitoring feature from their devices when it is no longer necessary.
Some of the countries using the app have used a location-based networking method to reduce the chance of app downloads and censorship.
In Israel, network-based surveillance has been approved.
A web-based solution that can access environmental data has a significant quality problem.
However, all systems with a central server have a private environment gateway and only a few low-level methods to connect the central server (see the section below).
In South Korea, an out-of-office system has been implemented to track the movement of migrants.
Using a dedicated app that tracks advanced mobile tracking and map navigation, and data from separate sources, these patients can track text messages.
In addition to the disclosure of potential contacts, the government has made the location information available to the public, allowing for a change in information policy following the country's MERS outbreak.
This information is available on various apps and websites.Countries such as Germany are also using a centralized and privacy-preserving system.
No data has been released as of April 6, 2020.
The process of identifying contacts by maintaining a low noise level is legally mandated and a literature body investigating this was launched in 2013.As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of users can use a low noise level solution, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record how close they are to other phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a collaborative effort with a centralized and non-centralized approach, and is a separate protocol.Non-centralized protocols include privacy-sensitive offerings monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary substitution numbers (TCN, FKA substitution numbers, CEN), individual vulnerability protocols and mobile substitution monitoring (PACT) and other non-centralized measures.
In these protocols, no sensitive personal information is removed from the device and all data collection is done on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is developing a secure way to detect COVID-19 transmission through the use of a privacy-preserving technique called the path intersection data stream.
"It is based on research from the White Paper "Removing APAT: Protecting Privacy During the Pandemic", published in March 2020, and another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a private technology development company based at the MIT Media Lab".
Sef:Trace users will exchange their Gly addresses and survey status with their customers and employees without any confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by a group of consensus-based approaches and interoperable protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and working together to create a global tracking and tracking platform for the widely distributed key.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the country's official government app had been released via the Luthres protocol.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control the mobile platforms for Android and iOS, announced a privacy-friendly communications surveillance initiative based on low-power Bluetooth technology and secure encryption.
The system also includes flashing of the leading technologies used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be rolled out in three phases.
Tools for governments to create privacy-sensitive coronavirus tracking apps
The process involved first directly upgrading the OS to Android, then to Apple, by updating the operating system to the computer, and then to the rest of the system in a similar way to avoid the problem of having to remove it from the system and the subsequent revision.
b'Drug reuse (also known as drug reuse for another purpose, re-profiling, re-use or drug conversion) is the reuse of a drug that is approved to treat another disease or health condition for another disease.
This is currently the only line of scientific research being monitored for the development of effective and safe COVID-19 treatments.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convulsive plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has 66 potential drug-producing proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Research on the potential sites of the proteins provides a realistic blueprint for developing an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Proteins produced from the SARS-CoV-2 target are highly useful papayin-type proteases, RNA-hard RNA polymerases, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribophosphites.
Hussein AA, et al. identified several compounds and then developed a highly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug with similar efficacy to the approved drug, and were able to increase the efficacy in preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is used for a number of autoimmune and other diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine are among the four drugs approved for clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State will begin testing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under emergency use authorization (EUA).
The vaccine has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials and has been approved as an experimental vaccine for patients who have been hospitalized in clinical trials but have not been able to obtain a vaccine.
The CDC has not yet determined whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Doctors have said they will use the drug when there is no other option.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a safety and efficacy trial for the use of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis.
" Chinese clinical trials have shown favipiravir to be ""clearly effective"" in Wuhan and Shenzhen. "
35 people in Shenzhen were declared free of the virus within 4 days, and 45 people who were not tested were in a case for 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical company reminds the public that the current evidence supporting the drug is tentative and insufficient.
On 2 March, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan and use the army to distribute it to university hospitals treating COVID-19 patients.
The South China Post says Shinzo Abe has submitted a proposal to the Trump administration to buy the vaccine. The vaccine may not be effective in cases of severe acute illness, as the virus is highly contagious.
It may not be safe for women who are trying to conceive to use contraceptives.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (caltera) concluded that the combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir was also effective.
These drugs inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to proteases.
A research team at the University of Colorado is working to improve drugs to create compounds that are linked to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism that the scientific community is using resources for other purposes in developing drugs for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the global potency trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences to prevent Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection.Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity against various phyllo-, pneumo-, mara-micso-, and coronaviruses.
One problem with these antiviral drugs is the development of mutation resistance, which can lead to more severe disease and spread.
Some early clinical studies have suggested that remdesivir has a high genetic limit for survival.Many clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one in people with moderate disease and one in people with severe disease.
There are currently three clinical trials of vitamin C administered via blood transfusion to patients with severe illness due to COVID-19: two with placebo control (China, Canada) and one with no control (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, New York State began testing an antibiotic called azithromycin.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) announced that it will launch a clinical trial to test whether an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma called Teijin's Alvesco (ciclesonide) is a cure for the novel coronavirus in patients who have not yet developed symptoms.
200 patients with severe disease undergoing treatment from Denmark, Germany and Austria will be recruited for a Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for efficacy.

Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers or those with effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Several anti-smoking agents are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, a light molecular weight drug, is used to treat many patients, and the Italian Medicines Agency has supported this recommendation for some time.
A clinical trial of 300 patients with inoxaparin sodium was announced in Italy on April 14 to test its effectiveness as a preventive and therapeutic agent.
SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, and prior to the spread of much scientific interest, MERS, SARS and West Nile virus were approved for antiviral therapy and were re-introduced into the targeted population.
Ribavirin: China's 7th edition of the guidelines recommends ribavirin as a treatment for COVID-19.
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the 7th edition of the CHI
Some antibiotics may be proposed as treatments for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (an anti-IL-6 receptor): is licensed in China.

b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine that protects against the coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2019.
While there are no scheduled clinical trials, several trials are underway to develop a vaccine of this quality.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, within 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in Phase I immunization.
COVID-19 was detected in September 2019.
A pandemic spread across the world in 2020, leading to increased investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Several companies are working to develop vaccines using sequenced genomes for SARS-CoV-2.
The key points of the CEPI's vaccine development, announced in April, are speed, manageability, availability in large numbers, and global supply.
In April, CEPI-I scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under study and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19 by early 2020.
Key stages to the Phase I safety study include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) is a class I developmental and vaccine agent (Moderna, mRNA-1273).
viral vector (phase I development and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to a report by CEPI Scientists in April, 115 generic vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information (never intended or designed to be in the pipeline).
Phase I-II trials are the most common safety, immunogenicity, randomized, placebo-controlled, and multi-site tests to determine the accuracy and efficacy of a drug.
Phase III trials involve large numbers of participants and control groups, as well as vaccine efficacy trials to prevent disease with control of adverse drug reactions at the required dose.
Practical development of 79 vaccine candidates as of April 2020; 74 were not in human trials (still under investigation)
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine that could stimulate the body's immune response by altering the viral protein of a molecular clamp.

In the development and production of vaccines.
The partners announced that they plan to conduct preclinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it had started work with 11 isolated sites and that it would take at least one and a half to two years to complete the work with the fastest possible response time.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a Quebec-based company, announced that it was developing a coronavirus vaccine with limited funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in clinical trials, with human trials scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier in the week, US President Donald Trump offered a "large sum" to buy a COVID-19 vaccine that the German government had rejected, The Guardian reported.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced that it will collaborate with the German company BioNTech to develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
An mRNA-based vaccine, BNT162, is in preclinical trials and the next one is expected to be launched in April 2020.
Takis Biotech, an Italian company, announced in Italy on March 17, 2020 that it would begin clinical trials in April 2020 and final human trials in September.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Innovation (CEPI) in France announced that it has invested US$4.9 million in the development of COVID-19 vaccines.In addition, the CEPI's investment in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, with the participation of Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, has increased to US$29 million.
CEPI's investment partners involved in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curavax, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates in animals.
On 20 March 2020, researchers at Imperial College London announced that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate received a patch from China within 14 days of receiving it.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced that it would provide $275 million to fund 96 research projects to use vaccines in large doses as a medical response to COVID-19 offered by Canadian universities and institutions such as the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Chicago.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced plans to invest $192 million in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and a vaccine bank that would have many new vaccines to be used in the event of another coronavirus pandemic.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania announced that the PittCoVacc COVID-19 vaccine, a subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine, had produced a robust antigen-specific antibody response [in the MNA] that occurs 2 weeks after immunization.
April 16, 2020 In Canada, the use of a nasal swab to collect vaccine is prohibited.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA inside the host bacteria is replicated to produce non-damaged viral-like components, and the immune system produces antibodies to foreign substances against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to leverage IBM supercomputers, in collaboration with cloud computing powerhouses Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects.
This means that they can benefit from the disease more than they can prevent it.
Further testing by Australia is needed to register 4,170 healthcare workers
Vaccines in development may be unsafe or ineffective.
Studies conducted on animal models of COVID-19 vaccines to test the efficacy of vaccines suggest the importance of Level 3 biosecurity containment measures and a robust safety protocol for the control of viruses such as ACE2-infected mutants, other laboratory animals, and non-human carriers.
Internal models of human-animal vaccines against SARS and MERS
There is no safe or effective vaccine or vaccine against SARS in 2020.
Based on the papers published in 2005 and 2006, the development of a new SARS vaccine or treatment is a priority for governments and public health authorities.There is no approved vaccine against MERS.
At the peak of MERS, there was a belief that the current SARS vaccine research could have a useful model for the development of a vaccine and MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, one Class I vaccine in human clinical trials was in development and three others were in development, all of which were viral-vectored, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S) (DNA-derived) MERS vaccine.
Social media posts have suggested that the COVID-19 virus was known and that a vaccine is available.
The patents on social media are patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS.
b'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, jaw pain, tingling, sore throat, loss of lifting ability and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases are mild, some can lead to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from the disease. The virus is transmitted primarily by people who have to be in close contact, usually through small fecal spots, or by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these particles are produced by breathing air, they travel over long distances and fall to the ground or other places to be eaten by humans.
People can become infected by touching the infected area and biting their eyes, nose or mouth.
These viruses can survive on exposed surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious during the first three days of onset of symptoms, although transmission may occur in the later stages of the disease.The standard method of detecting disease is by means of a truly reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with the removal of nasopharyngeal swabs.
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and their loved ones.
The general public's advice on mask use varies, with some authorities saying it should not be used, others recommending it, and others looking for their own benefit.
At this time, there is no specific anti-viral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded across all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or may only develop symptoms like those of the common cold, such as fever, fever, fatigue and shortness of breath.
sudden symptoms of shortness of breath, persistent chest pain, dizziness, difficulty moving, swollen face or lips; if these symptoms develop, immediate medical attention is required.
Abnormal, upper respiratory symptoms may include a tingling, nasal congestion, or a sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been reported in several cases.
A Chinese case had only initial symptoms of heart pressure and palpitation.
In some people, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the time scale.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms show symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The pathway of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may help to spread the virus.
A large number of asymptomatic cases are being identified and monitored at this time, with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Center (KCDC) reporting that 20% of confirmed cases do not show symptoms in hospital admissions.
China's National Health Commission began to collect asymptomatic cases on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic and were being investigated.
A large number of viruses are carried by ticks and ticks.
Speech without words can cause more damage than normal speech.
A study in Singapore shows that uncovered mouth breathing can make the stones move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
As the virus is not fully airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has identified possible bioaerosol transmission as a possible cause, and airborne samples from people in other people's rooms have tested positive for RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can result in respiratory fluids that need to be aerolyzed, which can lead to respiratory infection.
Although there is a risk of transmission through the mouth, this is believed to be a low probability. The virus is most likely to spread if people are symptomatic; however, transmission can occur before symptoms develop, although the probability is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said it was unclear how easily the disease was transmitted, but one person could infect two or three people.
In particular, the virus was able to survive for one day in Armadio, for three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for four hours in 99% copper.
However, this may vary depending on the sensitivity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are effective if used properly; soap products weaken the virus's protective mask, rendering it inoperable, and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other fluids, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectants), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were collected two days after hospitalization.
Five of the six patients showed the highest viral load in the first sample, and the sixth showed the highest viral load in the second.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in three patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and pneumonia in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are identical to those of the coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which is useful as a precaution. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most susceptible organs to COVID-19 because the virus enters the cells of the human body through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found predominantly in the type II aliviola cells of the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called a 'spike' (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the human cell".
Severe cardiac injury has been found in 12% of infected people in Wuhan, China, occurring in patients admitted to hospital, and is more common in people with severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, and this systemic inflammatory response and immune system suppression is the cause of this disease, but new myocardial injury with ACE2 receptors may be the cause.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are associated with cardiac function.
High blood concentration (31%) and venous blood concentration (25%) were found in COVID-19 patients in the ICU and low recovery rates.Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alivolar lesion (DAD), and a mouse with lymphocytes in the lungs.
SARS-COV-2 has a tropism that expresses ACE2 to respiratory epithelial cells; people with severe COVID-19 have developed symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-receptive T-cells have been shown to interact with inflammatory IL-6-receptive monocytes in people with severe pulmonary pathology from COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have been detected in the NIRESSA test.
WHO has published various diagnostic protocols.
The standard methods of diagnosis are actually reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is performed on respiratory samples using nasopharyngeal swabs; however, nasal swabs or nasal swabs may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples to be taken every two weeks and the results are of direct value.
Chinese scientists have isolated and published the genetic sequence of the coronavirus, and home testing around the world has been able to confirm the virus's resistance to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and can tell if the person has been previously infected) were in development, but not widely used.
Chinese testing experience has shown a 60 to 70% accuracy.
The US FDA approved the first test point for use on 21 March 2020 later that month.The test guidelines were proposed by the Wuhan University Hospital Zhongnan to detect infections by clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Peripheral, asymmetrical and lateral distribution, such as bilateral multicellular grass, is common in early infections.
Subpleural abscesses, bulging holes (lobular septal effusion with alveolar adhesion), and concydelation may also occur as the disease progresses.
There is limited data on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Major pathological findings of the autopsy:
Macroscopy: Ploricis, pericardiitis, and the pulmonary convulsions and pulmonary fibrillation
Four types of viral pneumonia can be diagnosed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes hyperplatia, acute atypical pneumocytes, interstitial pneumonia with lymphocytic infiltration and multicellular giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar lesion (DAD) with a dilated alveolar exudate.
DAD is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia with fluid collection in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: distributed intravascular coagulation (DIC); the lycoerythroblastic response
Prevention measures to reduce the risk of drowning include staying indoors, avoiding public areas, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, breathing well and keeping clean, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The CDC recommends that you use mouthwash and hand sanitizer when you cough or cough, unless you have a mouthwash.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in crowded areas to reduce the possibility of transmission from people who are not showing symptoms.Social distancing measures have been implemented to prevent infected people from coming into contact with large numbers of people, including closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and closing public places.
Distance guidelines require people to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no effective vaccine against COVID-19 and no vaccine is expected to be available until 2021; the key strategy for managing COVID-19 is to slow the pandemic, which is called "flattening the curve".
The CDC recommends that individuals who frequently urinate wash their hands for 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or if they have visible traces of hand pollution, before eating or after coughing, coughing, or sneezing.
The use of 60% alcohol sanitizer, with no soap or water, is recommended in cases of insufficient consistency.In the absence of commercial hand sanitizers, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, these antimicrobial activities are derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Helps to kill bacterial pathogens with alcohol hydrogen peroxide; hand antiseptic is not an active compound
Glycerol is used as a humectant.
People receive supportive care, including fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other major organs that have been damaged.
The CDC said people suspected of having the virus should wear masks.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its efficacy has yet to be evaluated.
Personal hygiene, healthy living and nutrition are recommended to boost immunity.
Assisted therapy is used in people with mild symptoms at the onset of symptoms.WHO and the National Health Commission of China have developed guidelines for the hospitalization of people with COVID-19.
Medical researchers in the US provide free information and advice from various sources to the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no cure for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals prefer paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen as the first drug.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the possibility of transmission, especially in health care settings where aerosol-containing procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation are being implemented.
The CDC recommends that healthcare professionals who are caring for people with COVID-19 use standard precautions, respiratory and respiratory precautions, and be in an airborne infection isolation unit (AIIR). The CDC has issued guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during this pandemic.
The criteria are: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye mask and medical gloves. If close, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA only allows these masks for emergency use (EUA).
There is no guarantee that these agents will be used to protect against airborne contaminants such as asbestos.
When not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not as severe as those requiring mechanical ventilation or other ventilation, but a small percentage of these cases are.
Respiratory support is actively maintained for people with COVID-19 who experience respiratory failure in hospitals, with the use of a high-flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure to remove intubation.
It is not yet known if these two lead to the same benefit in severely ill patients.
One physician prefers the use of invasive mechanical ventilation in close proximity because this method reduces the absorption of aerosol particles compared to a high-pressure cannula. Severe acne occurs most often in older people (over 60 years of age, especially over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds for the backward patient, which makes it impossible to meet the demands of the healthcare system for COVID-19-related complicated cases.
In China alone, 5% of the studies were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have been admitted to the ICU after a slow recovery.
Mechanical ventilation may be complicated when COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation may be very difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control and high PEEP increase oxygen delivery and reduce ventilator-associated pulmonary injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be present in older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir has been found to be the most promising.
The development of new drugs may take until 2021, but most of the drugs under trial have been approved for other uses or are in advanced stages of clinical trials.
Antiviral therapy may be tested in individuals who have severe infections.
WHO has asked volunteers to participate in this trial to determine the efficacy and safety of certain medications.The FDA has granted temporary approval to Convulsant plasma as an experimental drug, which poses a serious risk to the life of the test subject.
He did not provide clinical evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app uses surveillance data to 'get close' and thus identify the risk of infection.
One user can view the status of three other users.
In the event of a potential outbreak, the app advises not only quarantines, but also local health authorities.Big data analytics is used in mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence to identify infected people and identify potential victims in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israeli government security agencies were allowed to monitor mobile phone data of people with coronavirus.
The measure is intended to strengthen the quarantine and isolate infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared its general phone location data with the German federal agency, the Robert Koch Foundation, to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine-related symptoms.
" Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Galera said that mobile phone operators have been "informed that 40% of people are still on the move".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon that attracted over 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid calls for a global creative solution to the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience anxiety in the context of quarantine, travel restrictions, and the side effects of infection fear itself.
"According to BBC's Rory O'Connor, ""Social isolation, isolation, health anxiety, depression and economic failure are all factors that are detrimental to people's mental health and well-being"".
The disease may have few or no symptoms, as in other common upper respiratory diseases such as typhoid.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or life-threatening disease take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women are at high risk of severe infection with COVID-19 and data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, have not yet been collected for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by infection with the lungs.
In severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
The most serious effects associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, blood clots, and heart, kidney, and liver failure.
Blood clotting abnormalities, particularly increased prothrombin, occurred in 6% of those hospitalized for COVID-19, and abnormal kidney function occurred in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 have elevated levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to some reports, the difference between the date of onset of symptoms and death is ten days, five days is the date of admission to hospital.
However, patients transferred to ICU have a median incidence of hospitalization and death.
In early studies, the time between onset and death was 14 days, but it could be anywhere from six to 41 days.
According to the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men have a 2.8% mortality rate, while women have a 1.7% mortality rate.
Samples of the deceased person's lung from histopathological examinations found diffuse alveolar damage and fibromaxide exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes are induced in the lymphocytes.
This lung imaging appears to be acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the China Health Commission, heart damage was caused by troponin injection or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people treated for sleep apnea had a pre-existing medical condition.
Estimates of the mortality rate for this condition vary due to regional variations, as well as methodological differences.
The miscalculation of simple cases can lead to an exaggerated death rate.
However, the current deaths are not fully explained by the number of patients who have died.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require intensive surveillance or die compared to smokers who are not exposed to the long-term effects of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in patients recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ failure.
This was followed by a relapse that led to post-acute surveillance syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether previous infections can produce active, long-term immunity.
The immunity is similar to that of other coronaviruses, with cases of COVID-19 being reported as negative, but cases of coronavirus as positive have been reported later.
These cases are believed to be the result of internal infection rather than re-infection.
This virus is of intermediate and animal origin and is thought to be a small, less contagious strain.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the transmission of the virus was almost exclusively human-to-human.
The first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, showed a symptom-onset date as of 1 December 2019.
The WHO reported the first cases of pre-existing symptoms on 8 December 2019.
There are many ways to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of diagnoses, health care system coverage, medical consultations, demographic characteristics from the time of the initial outbreak, and such factors as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 to non-laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths in people who had died from clinical or epidemiological COVID-19.
Johns Hopkins University statistics show that the global case fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who die from the disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who are infected and die from the disease (tested and untested).
These statistics are limited to a small population with a small number of cases that have improved.
Since not all infected people develop the disease, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
Italy, the epicenter of the outbreak, has recorded 80 (1.7%) deaths out of a population of 4,600.
In Gangelt, the disease was caused by the carnival festival, and was able to spread to younger people, resulting in fewer deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths were classified as such.
Furthermore, the German healthcare system is not over-stretched.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of antibodies can be obtained from donor blood.
69 deaths (0.004% of the total population) were reported from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the death rate for men and women varied.
The death rate is higher in men than in men in China and Italy.
The risk of exposure for men in their 50s is only 90 percent between women and men.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown, but it may be due to genetic and behavioral reasons.
Gender-based immunological differences, low incidence in women and the prevalence of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure in men may have contributed to the higher rate of male mortality.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals are men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths are men.
As of April 2020, the US government is no longer tracking gender-related COVID-19 infection data.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at high risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced the name of the disease on January 11, 2020, as "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said CO stands for corona, VI for virus, and D for disease, and 19 is the year the pandemic was first identified, December 31, 2019.
This name was given to avoid identifying a particular geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, with the aim of avoiding bias in case of international naming.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO also uses the terms ""covid-19 virus"" and ""virus that causes COVID-19"" in public statements".
"Both the disease and the virus are called 'coronavirus.'"
" In the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the disease and virus were collectively referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""pandemic coronavirus"". "
In January 2020, WHO recommended that 2019-nCov be the name of the virus for acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV and recommended the use of the name of the virus in accordance with the 2015 guidelines.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.
With the capabilities of the Standard Chain, some digital sensors are already producing healthcare materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the neighborhood could not meet the deadline, the local startup's engineering team built the required 100 valves in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation and false information about its origin, scale, prevention, cure and other aspects of the disease and conspiracy theories, have spread rapidly online.
Humans can transmit the virus to animals.
The study could not find evidence that the virus could have spread to pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine to treat the disease.
Global research on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry research.
In March, the World Health Organization began testing the "SOLIDARITY Trial" of four of these antiviral compounds, which showed high promise.
However, several agencies are offering vaccine options.
Previous work on SARS-CoV has been attributed to the use of ACE2 receptors for the extraction of human cells from SARS-CoV-2.
Three vaccine methods are under study.
First, studies are being conducted to try to develop a fully functional vaccine against the virus.
The use of such a virus, either inactive or dead, is intended to boost the human body's immunity to the novel COVID-19 virus.
The second method, a part of the unit vaccination, aims to protect the body against the virus subunit.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focused on the S-spike protein that allows the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third method is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine development technique).
Within these methods, the experimental vaccines must pass tests for safety and validity.According to the European Commission, on 16 March 2020, the first vaccination began with four volunteers in Seattle.
This vaccine has a harmless genetic code that is more similar to the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-supported mutation is a recommended feature of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine development, but it is also a concern.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were testing licensed drugs for the treatment of malaria, including studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The newly developed antiviral drug for other purposes contains most of China's research, with nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries, according to a report released in late April.
The development of COVID-19 vaccines and selected drugs has undergone a major overhaul, as of April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are used to test for COVID-19: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is some information on the safety of remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvements were seen in people who had been tested with a simple remdesivir regimen.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, was studied in China and preliminary results were published in February 2020.
However, a review of the study is necessary.
Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Water Virology Society recommends a dose of one gram per day, but two doses is too high and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for emergency use by physicians treating patients with COVID-19. This includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19 in China's 7th edition guidelines.
Preliminary data suggest that high ribavirin levels are required for in vitro detection of SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further biology testing because of its low SARS-CoV-2 activity. Studies of the first spike proteins associated with Transmembrane Protease Sirin 2 (TMPRSS2) have been important in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin have been largely discontinued, with no further use by the medical community.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no treatment for COVID-19.
Cytokine storm is a late-onset environmental side effect of severe COVID-19.
hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have anti-cytochin STORM properties.Tocilizumab was approved for clinical use after it was included in the Chinese National Microbiology Study.
A Phase 2 non-randomized trial is underway nationally in Italy after positive results in people with severe illness.
To detect the presence of serum ferritin and cytokine stroma, a blood test was conducted to detect such developments, which in some people are believed to be the cause of death.
An interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on a retrospective case basis for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine resistant syndromes caused by various causes, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled trial that has shown tocilizumab to be effective for CRS.
The use of complementary and alternative antibodies by people who have developed immunity to COVID-19 has been studied for use in the treatment of immunodeficiency, but not in those who need immunization.
This method has been tested for SARS and has given unsatisfactory results.
Viral neutralization passive antibody therapy is expected to be used for prevention against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may also occur.
Other alternative antibody therapies, for example, the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The administration of a Convolse Serum, which contains a plasma of blood from people who have recovered from the disease and contains antibodies to the virus, may be useful for rapid efficacy.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Central Hospital, died trying to raise awareness about COVID-19 before being infected with the virus.
