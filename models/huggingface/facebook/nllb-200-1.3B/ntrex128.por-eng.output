Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid to go through Marretas
There is dismay from some Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) at the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The source of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Some members of this House, from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them look ridiculous.
A Labour MP stated that the group was concerned that the designation was rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, twp means idiot and pwp means excrement.
A Plaid PM stated that the group as a whole was 'not happy' and suggested alternatives.
One Welsh Conservative MP said the group was 'mindedly open' to the name change but said the MWP designation was verbally too close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the Welsh letter w has a similar pronunciation to the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: 'The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by the Assembly itself.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which saw widespread support for the proposal to designate the assembly as the 'Welsh Parliament'.
On the issue of the title of the MA, the Commission favoured 'Members of the Welsh Parliament', or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
The MAs are apparently suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus may be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to table a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the way the assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on disqualification of MPs and the configuration of the committee system.
When they debate the legislation, the MA's will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians to hold referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with neighboring Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to its territory, and has repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, has declared that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is nothing more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
Bells of St. Martin's are ringing at a time when Harlem's churches are fighting for survival.
"In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither".
The disappearance of the bars, you said, was understood.
"People socialize differently today", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people regularly head".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the estate sale may not last as long as the leaders hope and that sooner or later everything will return to exactly where it started".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the neighborhood shrines that remain.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so that will hasten the day when these churches will all close, as most of those who move into these complexes are unlikely to join these congregations".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later occupied by a black congregation that held its services nearby.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major commercial street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, however, when plans were made for its reconstruction, the parishioners of Father Johnson commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who touched the chime in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather stated that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that it would "try to pass on the costs" to it, displeased that it had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy on lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California on the first day of lobster season, authorities said.
The attack happened just after 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, then rowed toward him with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but later realized that the boy was shouting, "I got bit!"
I got bit!
The entire area of the collarbone was torn, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Life-saving Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was not considered to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper trunk.
Authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetics, backed by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain market share in the UK's 2.8 billion pound cosmetics market, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and household goods have declined, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out in more stores next year if successful.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the search by supermarkets for ways to use display space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would double its beauty product catalogue with the offering of up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also be given more space with branded areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique makeup line so that most products comply with vegan guidelines, something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second, at Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the shift from food shopping habits to small daily quantities in local stores have led to supermarkets now having to do more to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble department stores, as the supermarket chain tries to beat discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also installed a number of Habitats, having acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from health-product stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-point pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores a wide range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialist training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all needs, but the inviting environment and practical locations now make us an irresistible beauty point of sale that breaks with the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby dropped an £11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, was "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby abandoned an £11m deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly brand of home goods and accessories.
Their business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was quitting the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones livid by abandoning the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on his highly profitable new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which could be worth up to £1.5 million) meant she would no longer have time to devote to her Truly brand of household goods and accessories.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was flying to one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source stated: "Truly was by far Holly's highest priority.
It would mean the resolution of their future in the long term and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely stunned.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-made goods for sale at the headquarters in Marlow".
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning host, who is among Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, given the heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for additional launch delays.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we do not intend to comment on his business dealings".
Hard talk and then we fell in love
The American president jokingly mentioned criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unfit for a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said, in his fake voice of "news pivot".
"I gave in to nothing".
He reported that Kim is interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North sees no "corresponding response" from the US to the first steps toward North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, he said, the US is pursuing sanctions designed to keep up the pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"It's going very well with North Korea", he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have this wonderful relationship now".
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: the end of rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of US military personnel.
Moreover, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases been clear that they are not asking for international help, so it becomes a bit difficult", said Ms Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to head to Palu, there is no guarantee yet that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the ravages of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite the validity of a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made improving decrepit infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, spent huge sums on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has plagued Mr Joko's executive as he faces re-election next year.
The president is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using katanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long shot for the tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool team from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He made a tap to his left before making a shot towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed for the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a flying Arrizabalaga Kepa and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq go as far as they can, so I was just winning as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I knocked, and I didn't think too much about it.
Chelsea won 1-0 at half-time after a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
On that play, the Blues forward gave a heel-back pass to Mateo Kovacic before he dislocated near midfield and made a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a fast pass in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful shot that went through the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
He overcame the defenses and scored against the second-row net with a left-footed kick that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at three o'clock on Thursday afternoon in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said earlier Sunday.
There are reports of large numbers of people trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which triggered waves that reached 20 feet (6 meters) high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The victim, 44, was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging people in the area who may have witnessed something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has witnessed anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images from a camera on board, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us as they may have information crucial to the investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about the location where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police have stated that they are currently informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he was informed of what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being told they won't be able to return to their homes for hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
He repeatedly states that "it is so awful".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the immediate area outside.
A number of police officers have been deployed inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone with information to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament has become the latest monument swallowed up by the quarrel of "historical revisionism"
Their removal would be an act of poetic justice for their destruction, which is reminiscent of the destruction by the Taliban of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable that, in the present debate over the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell by the Palace of Westminster would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and to some historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, from monarchy.
Whether or not this is a fully accurate description is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a notorious individual figure who represents one side of that division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and celebration".
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with an artery cut and covered in blood, near a market stall in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to a neighboring shed open.
In that hole, he said, was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the 227-pound pig had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed", said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Reports claim that Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had held a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can act as a "stimulus".
"They're just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the respect they deserve", he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States .
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, Rosa was causing flashes of 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape that moves to the west coast of the U.S. As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, it will cause rainfall that may reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain could cause dangerous flash floods, debris floods and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 millimeters of rainfall is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions are possible, owing to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly unwise to walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall can cause the canyons to turn into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring occasional strong winds and clouds of dust.
The approaching depression will bring heavy rainfall over parts of the southern California coastline.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small debris flows and slippery roads.
This could be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to occur in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October may see strong temperature variations across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a prime example of the dramatic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There's a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures generally between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern U.S. by the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched yesterday on six television stations the heart-pounding testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he's absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her while drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, stated that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen estimated on Friday, were likely to have attended the hearing.
The company has averaged viewership at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
Furthermore, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring office viewership.
To give you some perspective, this is a level of audience similar to the end of a football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Next come CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being verbally assaulted by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to address a Judiciary Committee hearing.
The senator stood motionless looking at the ground as he was criticized live on CNN cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
You were told that you have power while so many women have no power.
Flake stated that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast stations were all covering the event live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted to move Kavanaugh's nomination forward to a Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee within the next week, something the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and later with a few other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicising' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicising" Britain's future and harming the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the front page, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on the minister's so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU cover each other's tariffs is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to a news release from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, with police claiming Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, a CBS affiliate, reports.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had fatally shot Wayde with a firearm.
Bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area residents who cooperated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area authorities for their "diligence and effort to get justice".
Sims was 20.
This 6-foot-9, 190-pound power forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"This is what we are constantly concerned about", Wade said.
Volcano spews ash in Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached neighborhoods south of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity at the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in a 24-hour period.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and the intervention police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, blocked by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are normally crowded with tourists.
There were also later clashes, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, separatist groups chanting "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protesters, who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region inclined towards independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October which was deemed illegal by Madrid but was held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, with a majority boycott of those against.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing voting at polling stations scattered across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The separatist groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it was carried out, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they could vote, but now we are blocked", he said.
Despite a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their most prominent leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since last year awaiting trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
'Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen on the part of the Spanish government,' he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car crash into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30pm British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may have also shot a beast at the car.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga 's first goal for Livingston secured the win .
Livingston, promoted to the top flight, stunned Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of just two in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference at a time when Gary Holt's team is changing leagues, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side, who are still without a win away from home in the top flight this season, face the leading Hearts, eight points clear, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their streak of undefeated games in the division to six, with head coach Holt without losing a single game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses chances against stunned visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead on the scoreboard long before the goal, as the incisive nature of his play was causing all kinds of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense but let himself be dragged in front of the goal and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after he slipped to find Craig Halkett's head on the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing it could cause problems for the visitors on the pitching pitches.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free and Livingston got an opening, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who made a touchdown and scored from the center of the big area.
At this point, the Rangers were dominating possession, but faced an impenetrable home defense, and goalie Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was thwarted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow gave a touchdown away from another Livingston stop ball play.
Crossings continued to come to the Livingston area, which were successively settled, and two major penalty claims, one after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another after a hand, were refused by the umpire.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis of the work of the
Alasdair Lamont, from the BBC Scotland, at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They have been excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, getting an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall at their best throughout the game.
Anyway, the Rangers have revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team fell far short of those standards.
Their final play was uninspired (they only managed to open the home team once), constituting a sort of warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, the purpose of which was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside their country.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters made their presence known in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British Summer Time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died at the scene.
This collision comes months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the person and inform their family.
Barriers and bus detours were put in place, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the Prison Office reported.
The riots, which are still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 0930 British Summer Time on Saturday.
Special agents Tornado have been called in to resolve the issue, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one ward.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, emergency police officers were called in to resolve a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought-affected areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's exactly what's forecast for early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa will cross the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas in southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday in rainy weather.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression status within a 300-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 miles from the Arizona border".
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that may reach 10 mm.
For those unaffected by the risks of flash floods, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing, for the region is affected by drought.
While flooding is a very serious concern, some of this precipitation may be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-severe category", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the mainland by crossing the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-force Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
So it's expected to hit the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm strength in the afternoon or as it falls on Monday night.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, raising a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 8 to 10 mm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with possible highs of 25 mm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then head south into Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remnants is very high precipitation in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert", noted the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are predicted to produce sudden floods and floods of life-threatening debris in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers are appealing to anyone who can possess cell phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on your allegation.
The president said Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" that day.
"A confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant record of public service", he told the West Virginia crowd of supporters.
The president referred to Kavanaugh's nomination sideways when he talked about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running", he said.
"That's why I'm running around, fighting for great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy Republican Party chief told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami; numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them swept ashore by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu city on Friday when waves as high as 20 feet [6.5 m] hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to their deaths and causing a trail of devastation in their path.
The tsunami came in the wake of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of what happened", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move by itself: it swept cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and knocked down bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have amplified the tsunami's magnitude, the statement said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings were found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualty and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people in the area", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had surfaced at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage posted on social media, a man can be seen on the top floor of a building frantically shouting tsunami warnings to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the shore, sweeping buildings and cars away.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still desperately in need of food and other basic items.
The city's airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to Palau's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is rising exponentially to over 800.
It's really bad.
Although he managed to reach Palu City safely, where staff are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of their offices, World Vision personnel from Donggala experienced devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid groups began their grim task of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only access the site if it is declared a "national disaster area".
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still at the level of a provincial catastrophe", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'OK, this is a national catastrophe,' we can open the doors to international assistance, but that statute doesn't exist yet".
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the grim headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior paraglider, I have to carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse began circulating among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu sportsmen who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark instead of a couple of blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement park and preparing to introduce more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running after the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was meant for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Being formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
While being at the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, commenting on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the one", for just Ye -- being just a reflection of our good, our bad, our mess, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
Kanye is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator JAY-Z also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO commits not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has pledged not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Military men opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have been as high as 300 as leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America.
López Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting them monthly grants to study and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China ramps up its AI activity, the U.S. should double its research spending in the field, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and industry professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made announcements related to AI, even though the country does not have a formal global strategy on the matter.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to lead AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are in pursuit of the new AI revolution", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI success being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player.
Lee gave credit to previous U.S. government technology contests such as the Defense Department's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be the next one, with a view to helping identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to go to great lengths to secure state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing from academic leaders; it's the corporations", he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the US to boost its AI efforts.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to AI PhDs", he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations use it to fund researchers in the United States.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Joint Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians went to the polls on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of Macedonia's population, which is mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout will be enough to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question for the referendum was: 'Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue efforts to gain membership in EU and NATO bodies for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The national election commission stated that there had been no record of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters turned out to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on changing the country's name, which would open the door for its membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high and not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, turnout has to be over 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major disregard for the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through the whole of Brighton's defence towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling obliterated Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward got a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the play.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to hit open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He faked a defense before neutralizing the race plus others on the edge of the greater Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the opening lead in the Premier League clash.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right in Brighton territory on that play.
He made a pass over the defense along the left flank for Leroy Sane.
This one gave a few taps before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding off the field.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life difficult for the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the finals, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer is hoping to take the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the endgame for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can get on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the highest level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals haven't announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but some say they're inclined to allow Scherzer to pitch in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, had a bullpen session on Thursday and would pitch in his normal position on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President referred sideways to the situation involving his choice for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican influence in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running and so I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they attack, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, sleazy, lying".
The president referred by name to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and received loud cheers from the audience.
Do you remember your answer?
Did you cause the leak?
Huh, huh, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, one -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant of those who openly give their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
I am the latest in a series of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was the target of similar treatment because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday mentioned that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the General Committee meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today it is no longer the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever been realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political outlook began to expect me to turn around and take positions with which I would never agree - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there's a torrent of insults on social media calling for "firing", denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me I shouldn't belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments I receive tend to be political in nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down from them.
One of the things that disappoint me most in this era of politics is the way these levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion of "censorship" or change to the selection rules the party narrows its views.
I've received countless advice over the last two years, urging me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that it would "do everything right" for me.
But that's not why I came to politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government which left my comprehensive school classroom literally in ruins, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as mayor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused as to my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that as the country heads towards a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not to the Momentum of Nottingham; it is to my constituents, Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of "dismissal" or political expedients will prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late trials somehow skewed the outcome, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now top of the league, the only one of the ten to go undefeated.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team the better team, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The credit goes to Ayr, they've managed the risks better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a big penalty, before, just before half-time, he scored and then converted a home run to put the score at 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
However, Melrose started the second half well and the trial of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the deficit to five points.
A long hiatus followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on the mat, and after the restart Ayr reinforced the lead with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's reigning captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted try from Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense push.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for knocking down Climo without the ball on the penalty kick, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's in-progress maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately following the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent wing Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth practice.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems poised to enter the restaurant business after it emerged he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in with long-time comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to get involved in the "flourishing Glasgow restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a corduroy-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings carry a navy blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty".
All over landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the TIJ's ruling on giant screens scattered across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of their country's claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous Bolivian president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", was the president's vow last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the TIJ's ruling was handed down just six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "wasn't complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined some residual Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain dialogue after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must move beyond the past".
North Korea says there will be no disarmament unless the country trusts the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will never give up its nuclear weapons unless it trusts Washington first.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to keep the promises it made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to think that the continued sanctions and the US objection to a declaration ending the Korean war would ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking first meaningful steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on their way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections on the runway, which stunned the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very unpractical hats, and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a broad feather-like flap that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-shaped watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, although these were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks... just in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had boiled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, with a tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion claim, you're in luck.
Stylistic observers predict that these huge hats will be on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent in the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61-cm-long handle that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the very impractical hat that spread on social media sent another great creation to the runways: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit carrying it.
The burnt orange rag bag, adorned with rag stripes and with a white leather grip, was the highlight of Jacquemus' 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags coming to stores next summer. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional test results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With over 30 000 pupils spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further study and university entry, as well as for their chosen career and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an education sector that is able to design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can reach his heart".
This quote reminds us that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of the recent examinations this year, we find that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest utilization rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the maximum A rating.
This data, collected from the 74 schools under the SCIS, shows that 72% of pupils achieved the highest A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will unquestionably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages as an option are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons why employers have difficulty filling jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowledge of other languages is increasingly an imperative in preparing the younger generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a life skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit proportion, 15%.
So investing now in language learning is important for today's children.
The proficiency in several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK by the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a language set of choice in independent schools, supported by teaching staff who are specialists in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option with diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It must be done well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron starts for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will be participating in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be over one and under 48, " Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to be ready", he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump's rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the conformation vote pending for his choice for the Supreme Court seat, Trump intends to bolster support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below on a live YouTube stream.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over allegations of sexual abuse.
However, the main purpose of this torrent of rallies is to help the Republicans, who face a difficult election in November, gain some momentum.
So, Trump campaign officials said that these five rallies next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the hectic campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the early evening rally could draw supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get media coverage in the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come and help him with the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows strength to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three straight sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The pendulum swing of momentum is a totally invented sporting concept, but it's one that players truly believe in, and never more so than in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is coming from now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so we're looking at it as a bit of a boost, I'd say", said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is clearly ahead, four points ahead and 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some spare energy and plenty of reason to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth's been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural cries of celebration were getting louder as the round proceeded, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind on two.
His game-winning putt at 15 produced a similar cry, of the kind that reveals he still believes the American team is still in the competition.
"We just need to focus and worry about our own game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The unlikely but lovely European pair is four out of four and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd, it solidifies the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no player more popular to seal a potential European victory at the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of this morning's fourball, when they teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to getting out of.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the partners, the advice they give and don't give, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the US, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a loose lead after exiting the fourball and foursomes of Saturday's matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to qualify at Le Golf National, so far four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a failed American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two games won, but failed to shorten the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's singles on the 12th to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row when he and Molinari, who were given the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are just the only duo to score four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed on the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating an unpowered Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled through two games on Saturday, has revealed occasional hits of genius, but has already lost 19 of his fourball and foursome games, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get the best of it.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the men's major tournament, and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points on Saturday.
The duo secured a bold 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having missed both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team reversed a four-point lead before the singles, although Furyk's title-holder team only needs to tie to retain the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems beyond his possibilities.
North Korea says "not even thinking" of unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was exacerbating mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and committing to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we can proceed to our disarmament first".
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in that they do not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, in contrast to Pyongyang's previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
'The United States insists on 'denuclearisation first' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, opposing even the 'declaration of the end of war,'' said Ri.
"The realization that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the prolongation of sanctions is exacerbating our distrust.'
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the US leader at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the interested party in this issue were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this deadlock".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was drastically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korean rockets toward US territory was inevitable after "Mr. President Evil" Trump called Kim the "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, lavished praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for such a move, saying "whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although later North Korea denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes corresponding measures".
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they sought were Trump's security assurances in Singapore, as well as initiatives toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to rest properly
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the machismo culture of studying on caffeinated "straights".
One professor found that students at this world-class university often had no idea about the most basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for this course came after I gave a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you only telling me this in my last year?"
The young woman claimed that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains key concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the school decided to introduce the course after finding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, slippers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risks of stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it's not going to change student behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as we all have a right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "doing straight" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough and quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, and even to prevent getting fat, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year as a freshman at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a campus-wide course, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar programme of study before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using a bedtime alarm as well as a wake-up call, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt circadian rhythms and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men out of the game
The Rangers suffered another bout of grief away from home when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to lose 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since their 1-0 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side ended up inflicting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his side eight points behind the unrestrained Hearts, who were leading the Scottish First Division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the Rangers team, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With Rangers now relegated to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third, and just behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And more trouble may be coming for the Rangers after the district attorney Calum Spence was treated for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, used the same Livingston XI that stole a point from Hearts last week, and he must have been delighted with the way his well-oiled team smothered opponents on every play.
The Rangers may have mastered possession, but Livingston did more with what he had.
The team could have scored right after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish off towards the second beam.
The Rangers were able to regain control, but hope was greater than belief about their play in the third-place game.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been awarded a big quarter-hour penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson declined the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed just two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's weak kick.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected of the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone for its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't handle a long stop ball play from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in at halftime, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this trade had almost immediate impact as the side forward passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly sprinted from his line to effect the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes after long passes.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held on well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again claimed a major penalty when he got tangled up with Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and counting... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals".
Evans: "Look, now it's really creeping!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that gave it its name still stands.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory.
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in the lab so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, stated: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involving removing immune cells from patients and "training" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe in support of Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump for running for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he launched a brawl against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he says, 'How can you like Trump?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago", he said.
SNL began with a Matt Damon satire in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, the scene of West's bravado was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West when he did it.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"I was bullied backstage.
They told me, "Don't go out there in that hat".
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see the marginalization?" saying, "I'd put on my superman cloak, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try the love".
His comments sparked public outcry and SNL participants appeared embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of the show's hosts telling the paper: "The whole studio went completely silent".
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with his performance of the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a show of support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FACENING THE TURBA".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or supporting their "art") who I believe is harboring and spreading ideologies that are harmful to the community.
He's free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now "the one previously known to Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".

War of the Thrones star Kit Harington is attacking toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of the Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, stating that such screen roles often make boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones contestant Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has a "quite strong position" on how to approach the issue.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they've grown up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its overly masculine characters.
And he went on: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they must belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people".
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not be entering into any prequels or sequels to War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, referring to the fact that, for him, "the battlefields and the horses are over".
Starting in November, Kit will be participating in a re-issue of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers finding his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of the War of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way, she gave me my future family and my life from here on out", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple tied the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14 percent jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials said.
Some 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmission through sexual intercourse, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of year-on-year variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that because of the country's conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted through inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaks about Republican senators by a collaborator and attacks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her team had published personal information about three U.S. Senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and "far-right" websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and published the data of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie".
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious", wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, you can't get angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the prosecutor's motives.
It must reveal calm and serenity".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who will run for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if true", his tweet read.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the relevant authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the culprits will be exposed", he continued, "and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English's review of Attack Again - a poor parody of a spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for Brexit connotations in any new film with a British flavour, and this seems to in fact apply to the new edition in the Johnny English comedy-action film series, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and was brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satire about how bad we are the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his squinting eyes and an overly elastic expression, has obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything, that this is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-English filmgoers.
He's, of course, the idiot secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to mild glamour, has a little bit of Cloiseau, a hint of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Furthermore, his character was originally based on the international traveler and mystery man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for Barclaycard, which left chaos in its wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a rattle sound against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but the humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that "serious" film editions like 007 and Mission: Impossible now confidently feature comedy as an ingredient.
We're left with the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film numbers on the character of Bean.
Now, the premise, which is always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the consternation of the duty agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and contentious figure, already suffering a total meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best in this role that resembles the character of Theresa May, but the plot does not give much material for big flights.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that since all the agents in the asset have been compromised, you'll have to take someone out of retirement.
And that someone is the uneducated Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a fancy school, but giving informal classes on how to be an undercover spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and re-join his long-suffering sidekick Bough, a role again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, hooked up to a submarine commander, a spooky character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So, Batman and Robin from the disaster at Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful and fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd mischievous acts: disguised as waiters, torch a fancy French restaurant, create confusion by smuggling into Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the stops were certainly created with this last sequence in mind, but as nice and tempestuous as it is, the set has plenty of children's TV.
The result is quite mediocre.
And as in all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that did justice to her talent?
Labour denies that they are devising a plan for British people to work four days a week but get five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to give the British a four-day work week, but with five days paid.
Reports suggest that the party wants employers to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keep their paychecks.
Sources say the idea "would fit" with the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day workweek won the favourable opinion of the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for the industrial sector".
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day workweek during its campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported at the moment by the whole of the Labour Party.
A party spokesman stated: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it".
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the hands of the "faceless directors" and "speculators" of the basic service companies.
Its plans also include not recovering the full share of existing water companies, as the Labour Party may make 'deductions' based on perceived illicit conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds which would transfer 10% of the shares of private companies to employees, who could receive dividends of up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh may or may not change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy has been more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said on my way to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous".
Graham's vote, however, seems unshakeable.
"I'm determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive indictment would be necessary", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all those she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive roster of stars who will perform on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to see performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful ways that contribute to raising awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, how successful has Global Citizen been in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clicktivism" - do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters that have pressed for a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, with at least $10 billion of those commitments or announcements already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote of history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 lobbying actions on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced that it would fund a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responds: "It's been a long and winding road - sometimes we've fallen and failed.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use navy as "blockade" to put a stop to Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary", Washington can use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is to try to broker energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he said.
And according to the governor, there are ways and means to stop it.
'The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade to ensure that energy does not reach the market,' he said.
Zinke was addressing participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to leverage and replace fuels", he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, which aims to double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, chief executive of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply consider" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she will "deeply consider" the possibility of running for president in the upcoming midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the ultimate accountable", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider in depth the possibility of running for president".
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "it's clear we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
59% of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research.
32% support his candidacy.
The poll revealed superior support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at a rally by Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with one count of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what is going on after he's come back, I can relate to other families who are feeling the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds that our soldiers actually come back with", he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and stated that his son and other veterans "come back a little different, come back hardened, come back questioning if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other members of the armed forces, have given to the country".
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district sent an amicus curiae statement Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
The person claimed that her partner "and her children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
Public prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Resource Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle", reads the amicus curiae statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the police's ban on immigrants negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on ethnicity, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more desperate.
"The environment is very tense", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a male feverish baby, as she comforted him at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to save whatever they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured his ribs and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated abroad due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest-circulation newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked the beginning of what US officials, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue trade promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides applying loose tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of free speech and press by publishing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said.
"On the other hand, in the benches here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinion that the Chinese may have about their country's worrying economic trajectory, as the media is under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, though he did not specify which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of the midterm election with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many prominent Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn that this could spark a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward to a vote.
These things have no going back", Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is at the door!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee opted to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be all-time highs", Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news site.
"People say she's tall; it's true.
But it may be even higher, particularly among undecided female voters in suburban areas and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they dislike the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there could be a backlash if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his seat as a judge, it's also about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with a small majority aligning with the former.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's proposal, the FBI began an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh sexually molested her while she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two attended a party during the time they were both students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary tech persona, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
It allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse", or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is up to the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal data training".
Inrupt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some in-house programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to create commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: tribute to the Victoria Cross-winning clergyman of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had received Britain's highest military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, stated that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the event that gave his grandfather the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in very thick fog and under close fire from handguns and machine guns".
He then ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before single-handedly attacking a cannon and shooting down three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never match, but also a lesson in humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honoured to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people".
Mixed martial arts fans staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 are watching Porca Peppa instead.
Imagine this: You stay up all night watching Bellator 206, full of stars, and in the end, you're blocked from watching the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, viewers in the UK were stunned when the coverage shifted to Porca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after being awake until early in the morning especially for combat.
One fan on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad joke".
"Government regulations say the content is not suitable for six in the morning, so they had to switch to another schedule", said Dave Schwartz, manager of marketing and communications at the company, when asked about the broadcast.
"Put it on Peppa, yeah".
The President of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that Bellator would revise the broadcast schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we won't be able to solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none of them very nice.
We're trying to fix the problem, but we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise next time it won't happen.
We're going to cut the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do, and we tried to exceed the expectations of the fans, and we overdid it.
It is a regrettable situation".
Tom Daley felt "inferior" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claimed that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he didn't realize until he entered high school that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he stated that he spoke out for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
Longtime regular on the show, Kirsty Young, took a several-month leave of absence due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley stated that he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
In her words, "to this day, this feeling of being inferior and different has been the real motivation that has given me the power and strength to achieve success".
His goal was to prove he was "somebody", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they discovered his sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said it was because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "caught me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, 20 years her senior, though she has stated that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much when you're so young" - his first Olympic appearance was at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who's gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all that mattered was to win a gold medal", he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the London 2012 games because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not gonna be around to be in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and earned a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of my fellow citizens at the Olympic Games...there was no better feeling", he said.
All of this was also the inspiration for his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which he had identified with during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British summer time.
Mickelson down on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back in shape to prevent the marker from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record attendance, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourball and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has so often been on U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the men's major championships has split his day between being a backup and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what's plaguing him.
Having never taken a straight shot even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough usually punishes errant shots.
And if the field alone wasn't intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, will face the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points behind in the first 12 singles games, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood my role today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who's given a lot to these teams in the past, and this week as well.
I probably didn't expect to see him play two games.
I thought about it a lot, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we should proceed.
He wants to be in the game, like everybody else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never matched the successes of his individual career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and witty, likes to play with people and is a great person to have in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing".
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows his great advantage may vanish in a flash
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his loose lead entering the final day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an accidental ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest of margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a narrow margin", Bjorn said in the picture, after watching the 2018 Class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday, to take a 10-5 lead at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over.
Tomorrow, give it your best shot.
Go in there and make it right.
This isn't over until we get the dots on the marker.
We have one goal which is to try and win this trophy and that's where the focus should stay.
I've always said I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who's on the other side: the best players in the world".
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never outrun myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is individual performance and that involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there on your own, your skills as a golfer are put to the ultimate test.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're going to abandon their partner and he has to go and give his best too".
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will look to his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of these big twists on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before finally losing when Europe took the "Miracle in Medinah" out of the bag.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get that quick start like you saw in Brooklyn and what you saw in Medina.
When this momentum is directed to one side, the pressure is very great in these middle sections.
We've organized our squad accordingly and we've ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we're going to try to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the whole trajectory", Bjorn said of his singles choices.
New German warship once again delayed
The latest German navy frigate was supposed to enter service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but it will have to wait at least until next year due to malfunctioning systems and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the newest Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the navy in 2014, but troubling post-delivery problems have undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the navy had ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions of up to two years' duration away from home ports.
However, continuing delays have meant that the state-of-the-art warships, seen as a way for Germany to project power across borders, will be outdated by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put it into service, returning it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a number of crucial "hardware and software flaws" that would render the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the quota needed on the older Bremen class frigates.
It was also reported that the vessel is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the navy's ability to install additional functionalities in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached a staggering €3.1 billion, an increase from the €2.2 billion originally budgeted.
The problems plaguing the latest frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary committee on defence, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used".
The politician said the problem grew exponentially over time as older ships were taken out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long-eared brown and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations throughout the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all the recordings will assess the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affects the dorms and makes habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, along with fly-killing papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
It is they who use a sophisticated technique of echo tracking to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, inspections of dormitories, and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first bat-only reserve in Scotland, at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent bat area", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much we don't know about bats, so the work we've done here and at other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive".
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before any maintenance on the property, as the unintentional destruction of just one maternity dormitory could lead to the deaths of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish chair of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved and help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are taking revenge".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the rape allegations against him as "fake news", stating that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid $375,000 to keep the alleged victim quiet about the accident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, characterized the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just like,
What they said today, fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have characterized as "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the privacy domain", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's bedroom, where he allegedly raped her annually, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", harmed by the "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also alleges that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and worried about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims she intends to cancel the agreement as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would regret it forever' for losing car manufacturers
The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU in disorder at the end of March, we will see production shutdowns at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border transactions operate, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers claim are the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is managed on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's "Chequers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid these checks at the border".
"We want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the opportunity for us to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points to the absolute need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains".
Although it could not give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota stated that in the long term the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could, sooner or later, lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said that 'we have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU'.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed another week" as there is still no agreement on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The fact that Trump may be preparing to fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of covertly recording the conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday, he moved to the White House, with reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh charges, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it could be this week but it could also be postponed another week in view of everything that has been going on in the Supreme Court.
I always like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists would disagree with such a statement: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he noted that: "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism".
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more Q&A than any previous president", he said, adding, without adding evidence, "We've analyzed those numbers".
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this often, and you've seen that we've done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that you can talk to the president of the United States is a replacement for any press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences, while receiving foreign representatives.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week the president showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre manner before the reporters present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and to request that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying for the residency applications of EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'The UK and EU continued negotiations on withdrawal throughout the summer, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also been accelerating preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very unsettling time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we very much want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defensive back Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers quarterback Mike Organ said.
Tennessee coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He approached the sideline and practically passed out", Reed reported.
The tech and medical staff put Abercrombie on oxygen in the lateral line before laying him down on a stretcher and transporting him for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, suspended his studies during his freshman season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which brings his season total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to charge a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers who buy property in the UK, with the additional revenue going towards homelessness relief.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate.
The stamp duty increase will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers of property in the UK, with the additional revenue going towards homelessness relief, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises of more affordable housing and taxing higher incomes.
The stamp duty increase will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government's campaign to provide a roof over the homeless.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rent - could amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking over land they do not use, demanding that Mrs May abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's 'housing disaster'.
Mr Corbyn announced a set of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to 'unjustified' evictions.
It also wants to give municipalities wider powers for building new houses.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said I would devote my term of office to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving our housing market problem.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a house for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has become too distant and the shame of sleeping in the sleeper remains too real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's national team coach.
The 42-year-old Scot has been successful in the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently third in the Premier League, three points from the lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish First Division last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalisation", Ross told the BBC Scotland programme Sportsound.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and those are some of my best memories.
But that opportunity will only come if you succeed in running clubs".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear in succeeding such well-established names at a club of such size, after turning down invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, at the moment, success is about whether I can get the club back into the Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League", he said.
"It won't be easy to bring the club back, but I will only consider myself successful here when I achieve that goal".
Ross' coaching career is just three years old, after a spell as assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts' technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren from the threat of relegation to the championship title the following season.
Ross reports that he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads", he recalls.
"I've always seen myself as more of a coach than a player.
It seems strange because it went well, I made a living as a player and I had some high points in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressures of the job, but I feel really good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than I've ever felt in my adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 on Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Restaurant groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy fell 4.8%, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultancy, which compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of the good weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup career have seen the pattern of June, when pubs recorded a 2.8% increase in sales, repeated in July, but restaurants have seen a decline.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage business were by far the best performers, with a similar growth that more than offset the decline of restaurants.
The pubs with the food business also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out and drink.
In the direct-managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6% over the month, with meals falling by 3%".
Paul Newman, an analyst for the leisure and catering sectors at RSM, said: "These results prolong the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing sales in the outdoor food market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when combined with the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food-business operators. Only time will tell whether the milder temperatures we have experienced in August will bring the much-desired relief".
The growth in total pub and restaurant sales, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launching.

One in Five Children Hides Secret Social Media Accounts From Their Parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has a secret social media account that she hides from parents and teachers, a study has found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in fake Instagram pages
The news heightens fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake" accounts on the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news adds to fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a harmless "main" account to show to their parents, while simultaneously owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account discovered that the teenager was inciting others to "rape" her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters' Conference (HMC), found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of whom admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan noted: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected Non-Executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator's annual General Assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scottish athletics. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sport regulators to draw on her vast experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have much to gain from her presence on the Council", said Beattie.
Doyle commented: "I am excited to be able to act as the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to truly contribute to helping guide sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
As he wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago today.
I can't walk anymore.
The doctors said only time would tell if she would recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful work, but I have made a full recovery, I have learned to walk again, and I am even doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Milk pump ad compares mothers to cows, sharing opinions online
A milk pump company shared the opinion online with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first portable silent milk pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a wry ad inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom the new pump gives mothers who are extracting milk.
Four mothers dance in a haystack to the sound of a song that includes lines like, "Yes, I'm milking, but I don't have a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on, "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls".
However, the announcement posted on the company's Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it would alleviate the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born", wrote one bystander.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a pump-out for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity".
Others defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but it makes perfect sense.
This product is brilliant", wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It is a fun ad for mothers who milk (often in the bathroom or at work) and feel like 'cows.'
It is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy sector".
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs lodged in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who pump milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies, and even leave the house while they are breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of extracting milk, while presenting in a fun way that people can identify with the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded down the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most "godparents" are themselves undocumented immigrants, afraid to compromise their own ability to remain in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adults who are part of their households would have to register their fingerprints, with the data being shared with immigration regulators.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the godparents or members of their households are in the country illegally, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals", Mr Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the process of the children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their claim for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, according to the shelter officials and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities like the Tornillo facility, where the large size contributes to the signals of children's disruption being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without time for emotional preparation or for saying goodbye to friends compounds the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, even though the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they "will be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has still displaced millions.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we liberate all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any and all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that had led refugees to remain abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"You're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, setting the stage for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, impeachment and scandals end his presidency early.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable audiences with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
"This is a strong charm to people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember once you called a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunification for immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it's more than being an informed citizen when we're watching the sixth hour of an expert debate on Bob Woodward's use of "profoundly knowledgeable" sources in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a garment full of insolence", as the Washington Post reported) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' scanty descriptions of President Trump's...hum...anatomy.
For my part, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's done feels like a reality show because he gives us something every night", said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily twists and turns of the plot (antagonising the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
We can't miss an episode or we'll be left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, they were 26th on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
I wasn't sitting on the sidelines of television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

Significant external funding in the midterm elections for the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is experiencing a funding surge, thanks to a realignment of the congressional districts that left two incumbents in the race for the same seat.
The recent realignment of Pittsburgh's suburban districts put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th district sparked a bitter dispute over campaign funding between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have been attributing a slight lead to the Democrats.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then backed down
Some diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little protest from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked the Trump Organization out of management.
State Department officials decided to recall the leaders of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions against El Salvador were considered, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have punished this Central American country harshly with high unemployment and murder rates.
With internal meetings continuing, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled a speech at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three American representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study the Past
The next bomb to be dropped could be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, which substantial evidence is now in the public domain.
Mueller will allegedly be directing his investigation toward finding out whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
Should Congress change hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, while also preparing to run again for voters and perhaps be judged by his peers.
That's a lot of possibilities, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European counterparts.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup, provided the West had resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are currently facing several of these tipping points.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly filming the president, speculating on his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times story is incorrect.
"What will we do if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With a legacy like this, how could I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna Rapid
Rangers host Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians following the impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to higher flights.
"It was a well-earned point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with a positive mindset and scored a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end but, in general terms, the tie was probably the fairest outcome.
They were probably better in the first half but we turned around and dominated in the second half.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points, it will be a tough game because they got a good result in the last game but with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year was very tough, with all my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good atmosphere.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training is going well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past and achieve success".
Women are losing sleep over this retirement savings account.
Although survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they want, few people have spoken to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouse about the cost of ongoing care.
Only 10 percent mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not having that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family for caregiving if you do not let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you can receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial adviser: Your adviser may also be able to help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your continuing care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or financing from your own savings, provided you have those amounts available.
Prepare the legal paperwork: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney, choosing a person you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the setting up of a power of attorney over your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for you, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Do not overlook the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"It's not just financial matters, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan".
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air gun as he returned home from a night out on the town.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications disrupted, rescuers were unable to get any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a region stretching along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with less administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities in Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence investigation and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su, subject to a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the judge Saturday, pleading "obviously innocent", the station reported.
Palin faces three class A felony charges, which means he could face a sentence of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon while under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
Your girlfriend accused you of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans' associations after associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in the aftermath of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the region of Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the coast.
The prosecution is seeking a rare death sentence for suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
The New York State Attorney's Office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare sentence that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries, according to the death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, typically used by the prosecution in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the notification said.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York asked for the death penalty for a charge.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense attorneys, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative congress today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Backbench Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK "would have already left" if Farage was Brexit Minister.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided fellow believers has been underlined by the Conservatives who are in favour of staying, who have organised a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been struggling to maintain her compromise plan, known as Plan Chequers, in the face of attacks from Brexiters, staying-in-the-country supporters and the EU.
The EU's allies insist that she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have left by now", he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.'
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he stated: 'We did not fight two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country".
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is totally out of line".
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also attended the rally, telling reporters: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the activists who are taking the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Plan Chequers and start listening".
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Only prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs".
Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they rush to betray the 2016 referendum decision.
"This has become a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that they will not get away with it".
Addressing the elated crowd, he added: 'I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilise the people's army of this country which has given us the victory in Brexit and which will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the staying advocates marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists held banners with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticised the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
"These are the people who tell us that they will have the IT systems and all the technology ready for 'Canada Plus More', for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete sham.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he concluded.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There's been speculation that he might face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump's inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for President.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government and that includes a woman in the top spot".
Arrested in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU Tigers.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was defending a friend and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, wielding a gun, admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Station.
Sims, a 6-foot-9 junior raised in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games and started 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title with victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders in Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Coming off pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first and caused Hamilton to face the traffic at the back of the pack, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a fierce skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track free, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen came off the back of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of lap one on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tires very late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He eventually came to the pits on lap 44 but failed to improve his pace over the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me get through it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the top two positions", said Hamilton.
Awful body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are "evil, malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, look at how people are mean and malicious and fake", Trump said.
"When you see the leaks and the press releases and when you say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the leak come from you?
Do you remember her response -- did she release the document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
The escape did not come from me.'
Well, hold on a second.
The escape started from us... no, it wasn't us", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the leak occurred in early September, but denied that the leak had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story", Feinstein told the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality, and I respected her request".
But their denial did not convince the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "You know what, that was terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges in his favor.
"They are determined to take power by any means necessary.
We see the evil, the malice, it doesn't matter who they can hit, who they have to step on to take power and control", the President said, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeated by Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have made up for their loss on Friday in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second leg 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had managed a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, beating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford assisting for Beauvillier to increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frenzied first period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 1:10 p.m., before Matt Marquardt tied the game with Cownie at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer ensured the Giants reached the first intermission in the lead, scoring his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard again tied with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen take Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing the victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are taking on Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to help hundreds of passengers flee earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post as the control tower violently shook at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused on ensuring that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower in the face of imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for the Indonesian air navigation agency Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television station ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We were devastated by this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster management agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The toll is increasing, as there are many bodies buried under the rubble that we have not been able to rescue", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters) have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the scene.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances are arriving with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The present situation is truly tragic, but it could be much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, according to CNN sources, and addressed the military forces on the scene, saying:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports a man missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that a man is missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The company said it was working with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in saying that the plane failed to reach the runway and crashed into the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone off the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, claimed that the plane was coming too low.
"It was the best thing that ever happened", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to crawl with the water down their waist and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors working on a nearby pier improvement project also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people ashore before the plane sank 100 feet (30 m) below.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG registered airlines, but none involving Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the timeline of events the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
You described to the jury how you used cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to the Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several cell phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting statements she had previously made.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and claimed he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life", Hale declared.
The defense is expected to begin filing its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based group The High Breed claim that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to those roots and bring back the popularity of conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing through a "racist" text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that "she was more of a black person".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming the trial was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some concern when she discovered that new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
"I can't believe... more black", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she realized her delusion, a "pregnant" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice on the grounds that her previous African-American nanny was performing poorly and was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and asking for $350 a day in severance pay for the six-month period for which she was picked out without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't go unpunished", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent you something she didn't really mean.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people", Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you trust your children to someone who had mistreated them, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe this".
Calling the case "extortion", Plasco said his wife had been a mother for only two months and had to deal with "a very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone like that?
It's not very nice", the investment banker added.
As the legal process unfolds, the court of public opinion has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing to be told this now, after Paddington's been so successful".
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, would not have taken it personally if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication had a bittersweet flavor given his passing last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", he said that his father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to gossip", he stated.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a successful son: we are proud even when the feat is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
"Though it was the product of his imagination, "he always gave credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad would call often to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications doctors had given him to keep his heart functioning were slowly losing their effect and leaving his system.
He'd been dead for some time, and all his organs were shutting down.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold back".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", he said.
"I always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women post cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide struggle to keep others from following their path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, a resident of Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it lit the room up".
However, he gave up the work before he died because he had "dipped himself into darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about the potential repercussions".
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so you know there are people who are available to help and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't shut yourself in. You have to talk".
Kelly Humphreys, longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, very shortly after her mother-in-law's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed", he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them".
He said that his death was very traumatic for them, but it's something they have to get over: "It destroys a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the beginning of the FBI investigation.
"I thought that by having something like what I asked for - an investigation with a defined time and scope - we could be more united", Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "crumbling" in the face of a deep-rooted partisan stalemate.
Why didn't you want Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters to have the FBI investigate?
Their reluctance is merely a matter of time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, and on November 6th, if, as expected, the Republicans do not win, they will see their attempts to elect their nominee to the Supreme Court foiled.
George W. Bush has been contacting the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not certain that Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaker vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors decreases under Kim's regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 desertions last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as people smugglers asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled denuclearization talks.
The talks followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly, to collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps toward unilateral disarmament", Ri declared in a speech to the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader, said that Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, she would be immediately called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a shrill, sobbing voice, as he spoke about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations made against him "grotesque and conspiracy-like assassination organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election".
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves she's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court given her prejudiced behavior toward Democrats.
"I think you disqualified yourself with your statements and the way you attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
When asked if she would try to challenge Kavanaugh's actual nomination and should the Democrats win a majority in the House, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you're not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, or even to serve on your current court", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she feared potential Kavanaugh opinions against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe v. Wade case, given her reputation as a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions about whether he might overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision", Pelosi said.
Women have to be able to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and he can't vent his tears.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
A woman who was an executive at some company helped me a lot, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed a technique, and when I got angry and started crying, I would tell the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And it would go on.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant", continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a male-dominated office where I was crying with inexpressible rage, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman -- an unfriendly manager who was a little bit terrifying -- and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say,
"Never let them see you cry".
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you".
Patricia Schroeder, then-Democrat congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, a frustrated Patricia Schroeder couldn't see why she couldn't run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Given his late entry, fundraising was below desirable and he vowed to only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When she announced she would not be joining a formal campaign, emotions came over the top -- gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and getting the message out to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism -- and tears came.
"It even seemed that I was depressed", recalled Patricia Schroeder of the media reaction.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write on my tombstone now?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first wave of the US-China trade war was deafening, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the view of experts, the two countries' distance may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week has seen a significant worsening of the situation with the new tariffs affecting goods worth 200 billion dollars (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods shipped from China to the US.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the United States, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will falter anytime soon.
To make Washington back down would mean succumbing to demands, but to show a public subservience to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its strengths, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could sustain China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated", said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher on Asian studies at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who remain in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe beats the USA and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now racked up six consecutive losses on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is crowned victorious again after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had shown serious difficulty throughout most of the tournament, threw the starting tee into the water on the 16th hole, par 3, giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shone through all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the lowest ranked player in the European Team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the most decorated European of all time with a career-high 25.5 points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I can't thank Thomas enough for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I'm happy to have been able to help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the floor to your compatriot Jon Rham who defeated American golfing legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for beating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics from one of the greatest players of all time with 14 major titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. National Team struggled to get to the fairway.
American captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
We fought.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of your players were excellent.
We're reorganizing, and I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I like a lot of these 12 players and I'm proud to be their captain.
I gotta take my hat off to the other team.
They were better".
Red Tide Updates: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to new information from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there has been a decline in Red Tide concentrations in some areas of Tampa Bay.
FWC reported that conditions of lower spot proliferation were identified in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Tide Spot stretches about 201 kilometers along the coast, from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer areas than last week.
Red tide was also spotted in Pasco County.
In the past week, there have been average concentrations off or near the coast of Pinella County, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, low to high concentrations in Manatee County, low to high concentrations off or near the coast of Sarasota County, low to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, low to high concentrations off or near the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory irritations in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
For the past week, there have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwest region of Florida.
