The number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The coronavirus (COVID-19) infection rate reflects similarities between the EU/EU and UK trading partners, which indicates that, although the COVID-19 pandemic is at different stages in different countries, it is expanding at a rapid pace globally.
Based on the situation in Italy, states, hospitals and critical care units must increase their preparedness due to the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring treatment, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, cases of an unknown cause of pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the disease was caused by a coronavirus of unknown origin now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The findings suggest that about 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild infection, i.e., a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these are cured.
In approximately 14% of the population, COVID-19 becomes a serious illness requiring hospitalization and 6% of the population becomes seriously ill requiring intensive treatment.
The number of patients who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and have died is about 4%.
In this study, we analyzed the increase in COVID-19 cases in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the European Union (UK) and compared it to that of Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK and Italy during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 spread to other regions and the trend of COVID-19 outbreaks in other parts of the world follows that of the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 report dated 5 March, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first cases were detected in France on 24 January 2020 when the patients were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and the same date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
The number of COVID-19 cases and cases is increasing
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the COVID-19 case figures for each country worldwide, from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, WHO country health centres and international agencies, are updated daily at 2:00 a.m.
The data was used to analyse COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them to those in Italy.
As a method of counting the number of COVID-19 patients currently being treated, we counted the total number of COVID-19 cases reported over 14 days, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also showed the number of confirmed cases per country as it increased on 15 March 2020 at 2:00 am compared to the average for Italy during 31 January-15 March.
COVID-19 behaviour in EU/EEA and UK
The movement of COVID-19 cases reported over 14 days in EU/EEA countries and the UK overall followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the number of COVID-19 cases began to rise around 21 February and peaked around 28 February 2020 (Wednesday).
This was due to the rapid increase in cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK had an increase in COVID-19 cases (see Table 1).
Figure 2 shows the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March at 2:00am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had the same total number of cases as Italy had in just 3 weeks or less.
Our findings suggest that the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing at a rapid pace in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The current trend in the number of people infected with COVID-19 indicates that the epidemic is spreading at a similar rate in all countries.
This remains the case even though countries have different levels of treatment, different criteria for determining whether a person is infected and different procedures for determining who is tested for COVID-19, including increasing the number of people tested.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation as 10% of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and news reports suggested that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas were overcrowded.
The prevalence of COVID-19 patients in hospital beds and/or intensive care units that meet EU/EEA standards is only 6% and 1% respectively, (this data is not available).
Rather, these should be collected in a systematic manner that is consistent with the data presented on the number of cases and deaths.
A 2010/11 survey showed a significant difference in the number of intensive care beds and intensive care beds in Europe, with Germany averaging 29.2 beds and Portugal 4.2 beds per 100,000 population.
This means that there are countries with more or less healthcare facilities than Italy (12.5 acute care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010).
The potential for healthcare overcrowding, based on comparative data on COVID-19 hospitalized patients in each EU/EEA country and UK, and the risk of hospital demand exceeding 90% of intensive care units, is highlighted in the sixth ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment report on COVID-19.
As cases are still concentrated in some parts of the EU/EEA and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units serve populations in identified areas, patient and intensive care unit data should be obtained in the form of Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The developments in Italy and other countries indicate that the COVID-19 crisis is accelerating at a rapid pace in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Hospitals and intensive care units must therefore prepare for the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the local population and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring treatment, especially intensive care, to the extent that is currently the case in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC's assessment of the emergency crisis, effective early preparedness is critical to preventing the spread of SARS-COV-2, even in the transition from containment to cure, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases does not allow the authorities and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and implement the necessary measures if they are not implemented early.
Early diagnosis indicates the health policies to combat the severity of the problem.
There is limited evidence that countries have the capacity to either increase their efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 or to reduce the pressure placed on healthcare.
If this fails, it is expected that healthcare in other EU/EEA countries will be under pressure due to the rapidly increasing number of patients requiring urgent care in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and more than 80,000 new infections in China and elsewhere in the world, creating a humanitarian crisis.
As with the similar SARS-CoV virus, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by ticks and causes similar symptoms in a similar manner.
However, COVID-19 is not as severe as SARS and has fewer deaths but is more transmissible and affects older adults and men than younger adults and women.
In response to the many publications on this emerging disease, this paper aims to present a comprehensive review of the emerging research.
We will discuss the basics of disease, its causes, its viruses, its diagnosis, its treatment, its prediction, and its avoidance.
While there are still many questions to be answered, we believe this study will help to understand and address this alarming disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 became an unforgettable event for Chinese who were asked to stay at home for the entire holiday and the following weeks due to the outbreak of the disease caused by the novel virus.
The virus is identical to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is also named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to some 50 countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had infected more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 recovering and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number one enemy of mankind and may be even more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including on virus, disease, cause, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 which identified a virus gene isolated from several patients.
This study aims to complement the research carried out in this new multi-speed field.
In the future, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-borne disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, which emerged in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about preventing this disease and what we have hypothesized as well as questions that have not yet been answered but are important.
CoVs were considered to be relatively harmless viruses to humans, accounting for more than 15% of the infection rate 4.
Instead, in this century, we have seen two viruses that are causing two deaths to humans, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the first cases in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to other countries and infected and killed several people.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure.Fig.1,1, cases of unknown origin pneumonia were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020 the first case of severe infection from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the disease spread rapidly to surrounding cities, countries.
On January 20, a medical outbreak was reported, which meant that people could be infected by human transmission.
On January 23, Wuhan was closed and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical trial of the disease revealed that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct exposure to the Wuhan fish market, which is thought to have been the origin of the disease from an unidentified animal.
On 30 January, WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease has spread to China and some 50 countries worldwide (Figure (Fig.2).2).
As the situation changes, the consequences and the extent of the problem are still unclear.
On February 11, 2020, a cross-sectional survey of 8,866 people with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 gave a new definition of the virus (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but over 30-65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, a small number were under 20, and only 14 patients were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 was more prevalent in males (0.31/100,000) than in females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is more prevalent in the population than in Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 lasted for about 5 (2-9) days from the time of its onset to the time of its detection.
The duration of the symptoms was about 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The time from the time of her discovery to her death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basal reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), with an adjusted R0 value of 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases surged before 23 January 2020, due to the large number of travellers who arrived before the Chinese Spring Festival.
Patient deaths were 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), while the adjusted patient death rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three most common COVID-19 infections were sexual orientation (men), age (≥60), and severe diarrhea.
CoVs are a large, spherical genus of viruses with single-stranded RNA.
It can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The (S) glycoprotein binds to the active ingredient of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in the cell, where the two fatty acids are fused.
The viral RNA is sent to the cell; after the viral RNA is duplicated, the RNA is a mixture of glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins that form a viral enzyme, which then joins the bloodstream to produce the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 strain was released on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV variant with a genetic similarity of 99.98% in 10 samples tested from the original site of the virus, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV in genetics than MERS-CoV.
Using radiation detectors, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the areas of the railway system.
ACE2 enzymes have been found to bind SARS-CoV-2 together with SARS-CoV.
Instead, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 enzymes but does not bind as strongly as SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is less toxic to humans than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of producing a shorter, unidentified protein called orf3b and a secreted protein called orf8.
orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for human infection and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no active ingredient.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, and colleagues demonstrated the complete cryo-EM structure of the ACE2 enzyme at a resolution of 2.9 Å in the amino acid subunit B0AT1.
They found that the compound, which contained two atoms, was arranged as a single atomic molecule and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind to S proteins, suggesting evidence of CoV detection and infection.
B0AT1 may be targeted for treatment as a result of testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.
The source of the movement
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via mice and camels, in the same mosquito.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs, bat-CoV is considered to be the most common transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as it is 96% similar to two other SARS-like CoVs that also occur in bat-CoVs, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
Rather, the beast that helped him to jump the barrier to reach humans is still unknown, and his route is not yet confirmed.
Ji, and colleagues believe that snakes transferred the virus from the larva to humans through the exchange of S protein genes.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, found that the pangolin - a beaked, insectivorous animal commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine - may be the transmitter of SARS-CoV-2 to humans based on 99% genetic similarity in CoVs found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
Rather, a difference of 1% between two genes is large; therefore, definitive evidence has not yet been obtained (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The full extent of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive in a glass for 48 hours on dry and up to 5 days at temperatures of 20 °C to 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have some specific conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation at temperatures of up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; at a rate of 75%, chlorine, peracetic acid, potassium, and other toxic chemicals, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in killing the virus.
People generally do not have immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore vulnerable to the virus.
Currently, no studies have been conducted to show a virus-resistant strain of SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can rely only on previous studies of CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).4).
In general, when a virus attacks a non-motile animal, the first detection of the animal's genes is via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include the C-type lectin-like receptors (TLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through a variety of pathways, the virus causes the formation, growth of dendritic cells, and the production of interferon-type I interferons (IFNs) that inhibit the spread of the virus and increase the resistance of macrophages to the virus.
Instead, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help to escape the virus.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a vital role in the fight against the virus.
CD4+ T cells activate B cells to form antibodies, while CD8+ T cells directly kill the targeted antibodies.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help maintain the immune system.
Instead, the CoV can inhibit the function of T cells causing T cells to die.
Humoral immunity including proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in the fight against the virus.
For example, antibodies removed from a recovered patient disabled MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overexertion causes the release of free radicals, which cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, sometimes leading to multiple organ failure and sometimes death.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was detected in the first human cases, appears to be most prevalent in older adults with other conditions and pregnant women.
It is common for people with a variety of infections or with a small amount of infection to be more prone to illness than others.
The duration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is 1-14 days, with a maximum of 3-7 days according to a study of 425 early cases in Wuhan.
Rather, studies of 1,099 patients indicate that the virus takes an average of 3 days to show symptoms, with a mean of 0-24 days.
The latest study, mentioned above, found a duration of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) in 8,866 patients.
It is important for health professionals to set quarantine dates based on the exact time of the virus' onset of symptoms, to avoid infecting infected but asymptomatic individuals.
Generally, people who live in or have contagious conditions need to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Malaria is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, which may not be followed by any other symptoms or symptoms such as dry throat, difficulty breathing, muscle aches, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nosebleeds, chest pain, runny nose, dizziness, and vomiting.
Some patients developed difficulty breathing and/or anaemia within a week of diagnosis.
In extreme cases, patients were prone to problems with water flow to the lungs, low blood pressure (septic shock), metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with malaria and/or respiratory symptoms of acute malaria, even if they do not have a lung problem, should be tested for early detection of the virus.
A December 2019 patient survey found that 98% of the symptoms were fever, 76% were dry throat, 55% were difficulty breathing, and 3% were dizziness; 8% of patients required respiratory aids.
Similar findings were reported in two studies of patients in the same family and patients who had received an asymptomatic implant.
In comparison, a 2012 human study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had malaria (98%), dry throat (47%), and difficulty breathing (55%) as their main symptoms.
Rather, 80% of them required respiratory aids, especially COVID-19 patients and this is consistent with the fact that MERS was more dangerous than COVID-19.
Snoring (26%) and neck pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was reported that malaria (99%-100%), dry throat (29%-75%), difficulty breathing (40%-42%), wheezing (20-25%), and neck pain (13-25%) were the main symptoms and that respiratory aids were required in 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the number of new COVID-19 deaths was 2% with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, the death toll from SARS in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, according to a demographic survey conducted in June 2012, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies have shown that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 while the confidence interval (CI) was 95% at 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of its symptoms, specificity and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
These figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less dangerous than the other two.
Therefore, it is more difficult to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
People with epilepsy often live in the same household or in the same group or in the same vehicle, such as a boat.
The cases are those who have traveled from or lived in Wuhan or other affected areas or have been in contact with infected persons or patients for at least two weeks prior to the outbreak.
However, it has been reported that people can remain infected with the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from the hospital may also become infected again, suggesting the need for an extension of the quarantine period.
Patients have normal or decreased levels of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the first stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count &lt;4×109/L including lymphocyte count &lt;1×109/L, aspartate aminotransferase-induced viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver enzymes and myoglobin were absorbed into the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation also increased in the blood of most patients.
In the most severe cases, the D-dimer level, a fibrin degradation product in the blood, increased, and the lymphocyte count decreased.
There is a problem in the chest in most COVID-19 patients and this is accompanied by problems in their lungs (bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity).
Patients often develop abnormal diarrhea, sudden lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, there is a buildup and excess water, and the flesh covers the wound causing difficulty in oxygen exchange.
Pneumocytes of type I and II (type-I and type-II pneumocytes) reduce the amount of surfactant and increase surface pressure, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the chances of lung failure.
Thus, the worst-case findings of a chest test are often equivalent to the worst-case scenario.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 test-tube analysis showed an increase in pneumocytes, hyaline formation, skin rash, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, similar to the analysis of patients with ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary method for testing COVID-19.
However, as more people are tested positive and more are infected, which could exacerbate the disease crisis, health status indicators began to be used for testing (not relying solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
The same situation was also observed with SARS testing.
Therefore, the combination of medical history, symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging is important and must be done to accurately diagnose the disease.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang group described a method for using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter is tested) using a dipstick in less than three minutes without the need for extensive testing.
It is hoped that this new technique will be useful in testing if it is applied in final samples.
With the lack of knowledge on previously unknown CoVs, clinicians are better able to monitor COVID-19 patients, as they test different drugs that have been used or prescribed previously to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral infections (Table (Table2).2).
These drugs are currently used to treat infections, reduce the risk of seizures, steroids, blood plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and anesthesia.
Plasma from recovered patients has also been used for medicinal purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are working hard to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and appears to later attack other ACE2 receptors, including the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory failure is the most common cause of illness and death.
Therefore, respiratory aids are essential in managing respiratory and life-saving conditions and this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory distress should be assisted with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a procedure used to treat patients who have a fatal respiratory failure.
Furthermore, maintaining electrolyte levels, preventing and treating other viruses that may infect the patient and spread the virus to the body, and protecting vital organs and their function are also important in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that cytokine storms result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is an inflammatory response by the body to release various cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause the immune system to produce more molecules which are the main cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Reducing the frequency is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other cytokine storm treatments that reduce inflammation include activation of T cell-directed immune response; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, used to reduce the appearance of rash, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the effects of erectile dysfunction.
However, high doses of steroids have not helped with lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
In fact, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which can affect the expected outcome.
Despite this, it has been suggested that corticosteroids be used in COVID-19 patients who are overweight in low doses.
At the time of writing, no vaccine has been approved to treat the virus.
Instead, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead that was originally used to treat infections caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir was also found to be effective in treating other single stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has sent the vaccine to China for testing on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are awaited with great anticipation.
Other, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have also been proposed as potential therapies for patients with severe respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea, diarrhoea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious complications may occur when lopinavir/ritonavir is combined with other medications.
The interaction of this drug with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
The practice of extracting blood from survivors of infectious diseases to treat patients with the same disease or to prevent infection has been around for some time.
In fact, those who have recovered from an infection often have more antibodies in their bloodstream.
Antibodies are antibodies produced by B lymphocytes to fight off viruses and other foreign substances and to block the various molecules present in the virus and directly destroy them.
Based on this, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and tested in 10 patients who were in critical condition.
Their condition improved within 24 hours, and the build-up decreased as the number of infections decreased and the circulation of air in the blood decreased.
Rather, there had to be a certain degree of confidence and clarity to apply any mass-produced technique before such a technique could be developed.
Second, because of the effects of drug use, plasma-related side effects must be investigated first.
For example, antibodies can cause the cell to multiply and cause cytokine release syndrome, resulting in a highly toxic reaction.
The antibodies in the blood are usually few, and the plasma is much needed to treat patients with serious illnesses.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies quickly enough to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is possible to isolate B cells from the recovered and identify the genetic codes of the antibody or test for antibodies and the main virus proteins.
In this way, we can increase the amount of antibody produced.
TCM has been used to treat a number of diseases in China for thousands of years.
Rather, its effectiveness is based on the combination of different medicinal ingredients that are adapted to the diagnosis of the disease according to the theory of TCM.
Most of the active ingredients are unknown or not fully understood because it is difficult to analyze and verify the active ingredients or their active ingredients.
At present, as there is no known cure for COVID-19, TCM is one of the most commonly used treatments for patients with mild symptoms or those who have undergone a major surgical procedure.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
Most cases of COVID-19 were cured in several provinces in China with TCM treatment in 87% of cases, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 cases, the recovery rate was lowest (13%).
However, this comparison is not fair because there are many other factors such as the number and condition of patients that need to be considered.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published the results of a study comparing the treatment of Western medicine alone with a combination of Western medicine and TCM.
They found that the time required for body temperature to return, symptoms to disappear, and bed rest were much shorter in the influenza+TCM group than in the influenza alone group.
Interestingly, symptomatic relapse (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the treatment group with TCM than in the treatment group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was significantly lower in the treatment group with TCM than in the treatment group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and effectiveness of TCM still needs to be tested with other factors in more patients and in more settings.
It would also be interesting to explain what is being done and to shed light on the TCM treatments or who is doing them if possible.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often have a high level of fear of the highly contagious and dangerous disease, and people who are quarantined also experience loneliness, isolation, and anger.
In addition, symptoms such as malaria, respiratory distress, and vomiting, as well as severe medication-induced problems such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and headache.
In the early days of the SARS outbreak, there were many headache-related illnesses including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, panic attacks, delusions, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and suicide.
Tracking and quarantining patients, as part of the COVID-19 response, can lead to increased anxiety and guilt about the consequences of the virus, quarantining, and discrimination by family and friends.
Therefore, emergency care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected contacts, their families and all those who need it.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of medical teams in a variety of topics, timely and comprehensive public information on SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of smart devices to avoid close contact.
Vaccines are important in preventing the transmission of infections from infected animals and humans to potentially mobile objects and often work in tandem with antibiotics to fight infections caused by the new virus.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine based on S protein to produce a robust and potent antibody that neutralizes and/or protects against SARS-CoV.
A vaccine made from the virus itself has been tested in animals for SARS.
However, the efficacy of the vaccine in adult humans and in lethal-challenge models and its efficacy in animal transmission must be confirmed prior to clinical trials.
This is likely because SARS died 17 years ago and no one has recovered from it since.
In contrast, there are cases of MERS in the Middle East and it is spread to other regions by the presence of animals that live in those areas.
The MERS vaccine was developed using a defected virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral replicates and recombinant protein subunits and tested in animals.
The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in low-dose patients is urgently needed to combat the current pandemic.
Rather, it is a challenge to overcome this challenge due to the long time (about 18 months) required for the development and mutation of CoVs.
As a new disease, the prevalence of COVID-19 has recently been observed in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without any symptoms.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients are more likely to become seriously ill and die.
Predicting the potential health risks is therefore essential for medical departments to plan their ministry, especially in areas that are not well served.
Based on clinical studies, the following may be related to the risks to COVID-19 patients (Method (Method33)):
Age: Age is a key factor in predicting the risk of SARS patients, and this is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was most prevalent in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of cases occurring over 50 years in the 8,866 population study as noted above.
Patients who required more intensive care had more recent diagnoses and were significantly older than those without (age 66 vs. 51), meaning age is an important factor in predicting the risk of COVID-19 patients.
Genus: SARS-CoV-2 has affected more males than females (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Other diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are at higher risk of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart failure was also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and other illnesses are closely related and that each can affect the other in some way.
Unusual test findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates inflammation of the structure or tissue and has been identified as a potential complication of the patient, occurring during drug action, and complete recovery.
The link between CRP levels and anxiety and the potential for complications in COVID-19 patients has also been discussed.
Alternatively, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed in large quantities in various tissues, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when a reaction is initiated.
Thus, they are usually indicative of a problem with the heart or liver.
Key medical symptoms: Chest imaging and long-term monitoring of symptoms should be done along with other factors to estimate the risk of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are binding agents on the spleen and are widely used to aid in the treatment of erectile dysfunction to reduce the irritation of erectile injuries.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in SARS patients, many survivors developed a vascular osteonecrosis and remained disabled for a long time with poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short duration in COVID-19 patients.
Mental disorders: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered severe mental distress due to spending too much time in quarantine and not knowing what to expect and having seen their loved ones and fellow patients die.
These patients need comfort and support for a while to help them overcome this stress and return to normal life.
Based on human studies, COVID-19 appears to have different symptoms from SARS.
In addition to being a low-resistance virus, SARS-CoV-2 can also be a high-resistance virus with minimal or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other common influenza viruses.
Therefore, patients in the early or early stages of the outbreak may release large amounts of the virus in their daily routine, complicating the work of fighting the disease.
Instead, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when the incidence was low, and transmission was low in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 pandemic is much more severe and difficult to combat than the SARS pandemic.
A massive campaign is underway in China including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the imposition of a virtual quarantine in an attempt to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these practices have been having a significant impact on the economy and other national institutions, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the problem is slowing.
The most reliable estimate is that the crisis will end on Wednesday and that the slowdown will last for 3-4 months.
However, other experts have this hope.
Paul Hunter, and colleagues, predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more prevalent than SARS, will not disappear by 2020.
Ira Longini, and colleagues, found a way to predict the outcome of the pandemic and estimated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadians found that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may be a recurrent pandemic.
However, there have been encouraging signs in China in terms of the decline in new cases, suggesting that the current approach may be working.
Ebola was originally estimated to infect up to a million people and kill 50,000.
However, due to strict quarantine and quarantine procedures, the disease has been successfully contained.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be weakened in its infectious mode and subsequently become extinct or weakened in its normal human environment.
A comparison of COVID-19 infection with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure (Figure55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily through saliva or saliva, and possibly through contact with infected objects.
The virus was also found in the feces, suggesting that it may also be possible to infect the virus if a person eats the wrong food.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of those infected with the virus were discharged, including 17 diagnosed patients and 40 doctors.
Therefore, great care has been taken to save people, especially doctors, nurses, households, workers, and people standing near patients or people with the virus.
The first step to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; the use of N95 masks (series # 1860s) both help to reduce the spread of the virus.
The masks used in sanitation prevent things such as human skin that may be contaminated from moving in the air or staying on other objects, where they can be spread to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series # 1860s) are able to block the 10 nm at 80 nm, with only 5% of the virus being able to pass through completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and has a total length of 85 nm.
Since the virus can also pass through the masks used for cosmetic surgery when they are combined, the medical staff must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks instead of the traditional ones.
In addition to masks, doctors should wear masks to further reduce exposure to germs.
Bacteria can also be transmitted through the nose.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his closed eyes.
Hence, doctors should also wear eyeglasses or light masks when working with patients.
For the general population in areas where the virus is or may be present, it is recommended that everyone wash their hands with soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors while remaining in quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
A distance of three feet is considered sufficient to disguise a patient.
These practices are effective in reducing the chances of infection and spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new human virus, the very similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 would have provided China with a strong lesson in the memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the head of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control was still reassuring the public that the new virus was not highly transmissible and that the disease was not difficult to prevent and control.
This message has quieted the voices of the people, especially as the country prepares for the Spring Festival, and the timing of the fight against the disease is lost prematurely in Wuhan.
Chinese disease control agencies may use this lesson to make future improvements.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful with the implications for the public because each word has meaning for citizens and can change their perception and decision-making; (2) pay more attention to and respond to unusual information from hospitals than to official reports from doctors or officials; (3) increase efforts to combat potentially contagious diseases when they emerge rather than trying to calm people; and (4) consistently work on increasing awareness of contagious diseases and testing people and improving the way communities deal with all issues in a timely manner.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to as many as 50 other countries worldwide as at the time of writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV with similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to speculation that SARS has returned.
Rather, these are the key differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in the fight against the disease and in the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults more than young people and men more than women, and the incidence and mortality rates are higher among older adults than among young people.
SARS is more deadly than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients are infected even when they do not show symptoms and SARS patients are infected when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This is one of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 is more rapidly circulating and has a greater range than SARS-CoV.
Testing of SARS-CoV-2 and RNA can show that a person is not infected with COVID-19 in some cases.
Also, recovered patients may be reinfected.
These findings greatly increase the chances of the virus spreading.
Despite the early development of COVID-19, many key issues remain to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS-like viruses, we have not yet been able to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What animal in the middle took a virus from the first animal, say a bat, and introduced it to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively prevent the spread, and disease can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is binding to ACE2, how does the virus enter the airway cells and cause disease?
Does the virus also affect ACE2 deficiency in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot quickly and effectively find the right treatment.
How long will the illness last?
How does a gene change as it spreads from one person to another?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or recur in a periodic earthquake?
It is important, but it may take time to find the answers to these and many other questions.
Rather, whatever the case may be, we have no choice but to end the disease as soon as possible and return to a normal life.
Coronavirus from animals
Genetic mutations have caused coronaviruses (CoVs) to evolve in both animal and non-animal environments, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses, including the common cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has changed the landscape and highlighted how dangerous and deadly the HCoV virus can be.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has re-established the presence of CoVs in the environment and has surprised us with the high rate and slower transmission rate compared to the SARS-CoV variant.
HCoVs are of animal origin and understanding the origin of HCoVs in animals is of great help.
Most HCoVs originate in the saliva and are not pathogenic.
Some of the animal strains of HCoVs that first self-infect before they enter humans have also been identified.
Identifying the animal pathogen is a key factor in the fight against human diseases.
Studying the interactions of CoV-inhabiting animals can also help determine the risk of CoV in humans.
In this review, we summarize the latest findings on the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their detection and origin in animals and their transmission between different animals.
Essentially, we show the similarities and differences between different HCoVs by looking at viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current outbreak of the CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the one mentioned in this context.
Furthermore, the mechanisms by which the infected animals mutate and the mutations that indicate the severity of the disease are also discussed.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of viruses surrounded by a spleen, each positive-sensed, and containing single-stranded RNA.
The virus, which has a larger genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses, is named CoVs because of its crown-like genome when observed in a yeast sample.
In vitro, CoVs have unmodified genomes and are co-extensive.
About two thirds of the genome contains two large, related proteins (ORF1a and ORF1b), which produce pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyproteins are then processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, known as nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains ORFs on structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Many lineage-specific accessory proteins are also included in the lineage of different CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequence, CoVs are classified into four major subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV genus is the most common HCoVs and is divided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Classification results suggest that bats and mice are the most common source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the most common source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been isolated from their animal origins and some have become the source of human disease.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are members of the alpha-CoVs family.
Other beta-CoVs in the family include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are commonly associated with mild illnesses, such as the common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, affecting the lower respiratory tract in the majority of patients and presenting a high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was identified in the urine of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, there have been further findings through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, it was widely believed that HCoVs were generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the deadliest in recent history, affecting more than 8,000 people with an expected 10% fatality rate.
A decade later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused an epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The bell has been ringing and the world needs to prepare for the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs originate from mosquitoes, mites or domestic animals.
The majority of evidence confirms that all HCoVs originate in bats, where the virus is stable and non-infectious but has a highly variable genetic makeup.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created serious challenges in medicine, science, society and behavior for China and the world.
Tracing the origin of HCoVs in animals allows us to understand the history, causes and prevention of transmission from one animal to another.
This could also lead to an accelerated process of identifying the animal vector for SARS-CoV-2 from the original host to humans, which would have a significant impact on preventing future outbreaks.
In this study we show the origin of HCoVs in animals, their spread in different animals and the disease it causes.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that HCoVs are harmless in the animal species they originate from but become dangerous when they cross into another animal.
We also studied how the HCoV mutates with increasing exposure and tends to decrease the risk of infection.
The effects of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal-derived CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E subtype B814 was isolated from the samples of patients with the common cold, many CoVs had been isolated from many infected animals, including chickens, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past century, only seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of the HCoV sequence identification (Table 1) will have a lot to teach us.
The first HCoV-229E strain was identified in the urine of patients with upper respiratory tract lesions in 1966, and was found to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients with HCoV-229E had common influenza symptoms, including headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and malaria and vomiting in 10~20% of patients.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was detected in organ culture and later in serial passage in mammalian brain tissue.
The clinical symptoms caused by HCoV-OC43 are similar to those of HCoV-229E, although the symptoms are not different from those of other viral viruses such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally transmissible, and are most commonly transmitted in the winter in unstable climates.
In general, both viruses take less than a week to show symptoms, followed by an infection period of about 2 weeks.
Based on a voluntary study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mildly normal infection.
A few patients with mild scarring suffered severe injuries to the lower jaw region.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, was the first globally documented HCoV-induced infection in human history and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third HCoV-type to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was in late 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
The SARS outbreak has infected 8,096 known cases and killed 774 people, spreading to dozens of countries and continents.
In addition to the most commonly known vectors, it is estimated that each patient could infect two more people, with symptoms appearing in 4 to 7 days with a peak of viral load occurring on the 10th day of infection.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experience joint pain, headache, malaria, diarrhea and diarrhea, followed by difficulty breathing, defecating and later receiving fluid from the lungs.
Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are among the SARS complications that are seen in clinical trials.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophage-derived cell growth have also been observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and electrosurgical aids.
In addition to the lower esophagus, many parts of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be injured in these severe conditions, often accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially in patients with low immune levels.
The virus was first detected in a sample taken from the lungs of a relative of the first confirmed patient who had travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a lot of effort has been put into researching HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was first identified in a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be more common in young children, the elderly and patients with low blood pressure and urinary tract infections.
Coryza, measles, malaria, and bronchiolitis are common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another study found the same virus in a test sample from the nose of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first detected in the Netherlands, it has spread to the rest of the world.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for about 4.7% of respiratory infections, and is most prevalent in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, or croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and pneumonia, HCoV-HKU1 has also been associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
All four HCoVs are known to humans and are generally not expected to mutate to cause a pandemic, although there have been some cases of unknown causes, including the unidentified HCoV-NL63 pandemic strain, which was recently shown to cause severe damage in the lower peninsula of China.
In general, HCoVs are able to move and live in humans, and are becoming less virulent.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although all confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, cases from abroad and from close contacts have been detected in several European countries and Tunisia.
The latest outbreak was in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, with progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed kidney failure, which is currently the only MERS among HCoV-borne diseases.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases of the virus have been tested with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses in human history.
In mid-to-late December 2019, malaria patients with previously known SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the current low-level epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the pandemic is also called COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a 3.4% death rate.
Importantly, the case fatality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, compared to 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory distress similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including malaria, diarrhea and respiratory distress.
The reaction is also found in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can spread rapidly causing problems in the railway system.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they fall into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified and may help to accelerate its spread worldwide.
A comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 strain with six other HCoVs reveals similarities and differences that need to be identified.
First, the timing of the onset of symptoms and the duration of HCoV infection are very similar.
In this way, SARS-CoV-2 follows the same behaviour as six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, a person with SARS-CoV-2 has the most common symptoms seen in a person with HCoVs, which include unknown, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, small cases of COVID-19 can also be detected in the same way as in people with SARS-CoV, although the proportion is low.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak also indicates the conditions found in the outbreaks of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as strong as that of HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is not yet known whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission decreases after transmission to humans as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in negative samples.
The possibility of human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as a malignant SARS-CoV in some cases has yet to be confirmed in future studies.
It is also important to see whether SARS-CoV-2 may have had a period of adaptation as is the case with HCoVs.
However, the data on SARS-CoV-2 including the transmission, pathogenicity and persistence of transmission in humans will be relevant to the outcome of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Any mild symptoms caused by HCoVs have been well tolerated by humans.
In other words, it may also be true that humans have been well tolerated for these HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the previous HCoV pandemic.
The HCoVs that cause acute infections in humans and people with severe HCoV infections have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs must multiply in humans enough times to allow the multiplication rate to withstand the effects of human or non-human exposure.
Thus, the less the SARS-CoV-2 is spread and the more it infects, the greater its chances of spreading to humans.
If it is well adapted, its spread in the population is difficult to stop by lockdown or other measures to control the spread of the disease.
For several years, four different CoVs have spread to humans causing the common cold in people with normal immunity.
The virus does not need to be hidden in the animal.
In comparison, the common disease-causing viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and human transmission is unlikely.
It must exist and flourish in its place and seek opportunities to touch the weak, perhaps by means of one or more physically weak persons to strengthen them.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has similar symptoms to the SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four other community-acquired viruses known as HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible like human HCoVs, at least as far as is currently known.
However, it is more virulent than the human HCoVs and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to humans and spreads to humans in the wild or to an animal that is resistant to the virus.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and symptoms of these terms, evolution, environment, transmission, non-communicable and non-communicable HCoVs.
An animal is considered to be a transmitter of the HCoV if it has a pathogen-like gene that shares genes at the immune level.
The germ is usually adapted to the environment and does not cause infection.
Similarly, the infected virus is present with the HCoV for a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is the pathogen and is the host organism or parent of the HCoV.
In contrast, when HCoVs are introduced to a host virus before or during human infection, they are not adapted to the host and are more likely to spread disease.
A host virus can act as a source of infection in humans and play the role of a host virus by allowing the virus to replicate and infect humans and spread the disease to humans.
HCoVs cannot spread if they cannot survive on the host virus.
In other words, HCoVs can adapt to a host virus and remain infectious for a long time.
In this way, the host that is not reproducing becomes susceptible to the natural host.
Epidemiological data has emerged suggesting that the SARS outbreak was linked to wildlife.
Studies at the well showed that animal traders had higher levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibodies in their bodies compared to other people.
The larvae of the Asian racoon dog (Paguma larvata) were found to be infected with a SARS-CoV-like virus that is very similar to the SARS-CoV.
This was further supported by the fact that after killing the animals in the market, the SARS virus was no longer seen.
However, wild or grazed mosquitoes before being marketed were SARS-CoV-free, meaning that the animal would have been a live-in host but not a transmitter but not a natural host of SARS-CoV.
However, given that 80% of the animal species in Guangzhou's market have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that the microorganisms may also be active in the presence of the virus that causes SARS-CoV cannot be ignored.
All of these appear to be associated with the SARS-CoV virus but are not transmissible.
As a result, the animal host of the SARS-CoV virus was shown to be similar to the CoV, SARS Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
The vaccine has antibodies against SARS-CoV and BatCoV HKU3 strain.
This and other novel CoVs share 88-92% of the genetic material with SARS-CoV.
This study laid the foundation for a new understanding that bats carry new human diseases.
Several other SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in the feces but none other than WIV1 can be identified as a live virus.
An angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 originated from bat virus samples and was shown to use bat, bat and ACE2 in humans as an immunosuppressant to the virus.
Interestingly, the SARS outbreak in recovering patients was able to spread WIV1.
However, WIV1 represents the closest relative to SARS-CoV in the mouse, sharing 95% of the genetic material.
Despite the strong genetic similarities between the two viruses, it is widely accepted that WIV1 is not a closely related variant of SAR-CoV and that the virus is not a close relative of SARS-CoV.
A genetic analysis of the virus classifies MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
Both CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses use the same host, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to introduce the virus.
The RNA of MERS-CoV is similar to that found in the beta-CoVs found in Europe and Africa.
Even so, no live MERS-CoV virus can be found in the feces.
MERS-CoV and its cousin CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the genetic material.
Then, the bat may not be the most susceptible to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East region have shown that camels show signs of MERS-CoV-positive immune system, as is the case in African camels from Middle Eastern countries.
A MERS-CoV-like virus found in humans was isolated from camel's milk, further suggesting that camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV.
Significantly, mild but apparently stable symptoms of the virus were observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Go ahead, sick camels are not only infected with methane, but also with the big virus that is spreading in the stomach.
However, questions remain as confirmed MERS cases have no known contact with the backbone of the camel, which could be caused by human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission patterns involving unknown animal strains of MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the genome with the CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
And as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so strong that it is difficult to determine the relationship between the two viruses.
That is, mosquitoes may not be susceptible to the virus and spread SARS-CoV-2 unless similar mosquito-CoVs are detected.
In theory, the animal that transmits the SARS-CoV-2 virus must be one of those species that live in the wild and are sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first COVID-19 infection was reported, there is likely to be animal-to-human transmission of the disease.
Several previous studies based on genetic modification have suggested that a group of endangered animals called pangolins (Manis javanica) may also have antibodies to beta-CoVs similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This rare species of pangolin contains a CoV gene that shares 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
Rather, it is very similar to RaTG13 with about 90% at the molecular level.
They have isolated 2 sub-lineages of the SARS-CoV-2-like virus in a gene expression that shares a (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of the genetic material being identical.
In a special comparison, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differed significantly but were felt in the transition of genetic modification.
Early studies on pathogenic pangolins also showed infection with the virus in lung samples related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of techniques including genetic modification to obtain a gene with 86.3% homology to the virus.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the only animals that live in a virus that does not transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Currently, there is no data to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the linear differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs of pangolin.
Similarly, the time interval between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs of the pangolin.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other humanoid animals is not yet known.
While genetic linkages have been found between RBDs and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the viruses that are specific to SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share a common codon.
It is believed that the strong similarity between RBDs in pangolin-resistant SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is dominated by isolated mutations.
A different proposal supports the link between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the wild.
As a driving force in mutation, interconvergence is common in beta-CoVs.
A decision has not yet been made on the animal source of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the most common pathogenic HCoVs, the animal-derived HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
Biological studies have suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from CoVs in mosquitoes, while the parent virus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 has been identified in mosquitoes.
It has been reported that the virus-associated ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) has been isolated in North America as a triple-colored virus and is closely related to HCoV-NL63.
In other words, HCoV-229E was infected by a genetically modified CoV, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, reported in Ghana, where camels are also thought to be the host of the virus.
For the sake of clarity, the current information on the animal origin of known HCoVs is derived from Figure 1 and Table 2.
Evolutionary studies have revealed that HCoVs are spreading through the animal kingdom as historically.
When HCoV-OC43 was transferred from one species to humans from domestic animals in 1890, a respiratory infection was discovered.
The history of the spread of the HCoV-229E variant is not clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several different messages supporting the spread spread from bats to people directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, have a close relationship with bats in the division of their habitat.
Rather, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are mutant and do not cause bat disease, whereas alpaca alpha-CoVs cause disease in the respiratory tract of infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in animals that have been released from the home to the wild.
Thus, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpacas are HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans.
In fact, rabies is a source of viruses that spread diseases in humans including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
In other words, while bat alpha-CoVs act as the genetic source of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels may act as the primary vector for human transmission of the virus as is the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of transmission from species to species from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of the MERS-CoV mutation from mosquitoes was known from the early days and this identification was confirmed in the laboratory as it was discovered.
It is clear that bats have a large number of species of parasites that travel in different species that are isolated from different species and spread to different species.
The longevity, large bat groups, close contact and the ability to jump high all make bat a viral vector.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been isolated in dromedary camels for several years.
It is a stable member of the camel family, which has evolved from a host of non-transmitting bacteria to a host of receptors.
MERS-CoV causes a low rate of infection and a low rate of mutation in these animals.
The estimated human transmission is accidental and people remain exposed to the MERS-CoV virus but do not spread because transmission is not possible.
In comparison to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, when isolated, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are a major disease-causing agent in pangolins.
It may be a vector that transmits SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, as is the case with the SARS-CoV pathogen.
The potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans is yet to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, the wart may be a target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People may compare the process of digestion with the process of digestion.
Second, pangolins may be a host to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that they were introduced to.
People get the virus through killing and eating the flesh of the locusts.
It is possible that human-like animals including domestic pets can be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of domestic and wild animals to find their immune system are needed.
Third, as mentioned above, the genetic and adaptive association of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species related to bats and pangolins.
Research into the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in animals is ongoing.
In addition to the animal species affected, three main aspects of the virus are also important in the detection of CoVs to break down barriers to transmission to other species.
First, its reproduction appears to be the highest in the genome (RNA) distribution.
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the viral replication rate is estimated to be between wsamous and above with an average of ~10-4 per year per 2 sites, based on the level of CoV adaptation and the specificity of the previously unknown virus.
CoVs know how to break through exoribonuclease, and when they do, they become more aggressive and sometimes less active.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to inhibit CoV replication by inhibiting exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
In addition, the rate of CoVs is approximately one million times higher than that of the virus itself.
Similarly, the rate of infection is usually higher for CoVs if they are not aware of the target.
Compared to the high rate of SARS-CoV mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation appears to be low, suggesting that it is now fully adapted to humans.
It may have already adapted to something more human-like.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also affects MERS-CoV, which is already common in camels.
In theory, it appears that a genetic mutation may lead to a slow-acting vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs suppresses the genetic structure of the mutant, thereby increasing the chance of the mutant species to be isolated in its genome, which is beneficial for the emergence of unknown CoVs under the same conditions.
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and the importance of the protein located at the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often undergo a subtle change in the pathogen during reproduction through the koppa-spontaneous process.
In the host host host, a mutation occurs most frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Genetically similar RNAs and subgenomic RNAs can combine to form different CoVs.
The genetic information is a biogeochemical sequence of viruses found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal-derived CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Contact with a virus is a factor in the transmission of disease
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction is also a major factor in the spread of disease in different species.
In this paper, the SARS-CoV interaction is considered a known example of a transmission-positive selection.
Based on analysis of the isolated human and mouse SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to be more adaptable to host bacteria, particularly by converting to RDB in the S protein.
In general, RBD in the S protein of CoVs is associated with immunity and is highly selective by the body's immune system in the host.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318 to 510 amino acid S1 fragment, which binds to ACE2 in humans and other host organisms.
SARS-CoV RBD can detect ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, mice, rats and raccoon dogs, allowing for transmission to several species.
In fact, 6 amino acid residues were identified as distinct from those isolated from human RBDs and 4 of these are found in the bacterial receptor receptor receptor ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV virus is a mutation of K479N and S487T RBD genes, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein to ACE2 viruses in humans.
That is, the two types of amino acids inherited from other genes may be highly influential in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares a similar pathogenicity to SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein's S-protein level indicates that the affinity of the S protein to ACE2 in humans may have changed.
In fact, cryo-EM studies suggest a 10-to-20 stronger relationship in this enhancement than ACE2 in humans and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to see if another vector may be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also activates ACE2 but using a different S subunit.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N on HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid on HCoV-OC43.
It can also explain the positive adaptation of the CoV virus in humans after it has spread to other species from the host animal.
In addition to the host host host, the spread of HCoVs across species is influenced by other factors that depend on host and host environment.
Differences in host proteins between humans and organisms that transmit HCoVs such as bats, camels and rodents can act as a barrier to the spread of disease across species.
HCoVs will inhibit the host and bypass the host's barriers to effectively transmit disease to the host.
Thus, the molecular determinants in this important microbe-host region still need to be understood and explained.
Genome-wide screening for SARS-CoV-2 viruses and pathogens using advanced technology may be successful.
Previously unknown outbreaks of HCoVs: back to basics
Variation in the pathogenic CoVs presents a significant risk for the emergence of previously unknown HCoVs.
In this way, the fungal CoV acts as the genetic source of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene duplication also regulate HCoV evolution and serve as two key stages in the evolution of the virus.
For example, the acquisition or loss of previously unknown protein-coding genes has the potential to completely alter the appearance of a virus.
In the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as the SARS-CoV anti-virus was isolated but found to have divergent ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion marker of SARS-CoVs has been identified in a strain isolated at the beginning of the human outbreak.
This decomposition separated ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mutation that promotes adaptation to a host bacterium.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of ability to bind to alpha- and gamma-CoVs, with observed low growth rates in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Some of the associated sites have been identified in nsp9, most in nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been reported that the MERS-CoV outbreak was a cross-infection, which occurred in a camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a number of mutations have also been observed in other HCoVs, including HCoVs that mutate with animal-derived CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It is also worth noting that human surveillance can produce unobserved changes in viral genomes, mainly due to isolation of viruses from surveillance suppression, such as from viral vectors.
An example of this is the severe loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, which is caused by double nucleotide destruction.
While non-mutant ORF4 can be detected in HCoV-229E-infected bats and camels, alpaca alpha-CoV shows nucleotide binding, from frameshift.
Last but not least, the prevalence of HCoVs has been unknown and is dominated by selective induction in the host.
No or mild symptoms were observed as the bat was infected with CoVs, indicating a common adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats were well aware of CoVs both anatomically and in everyday life.
For example, structural defects in the spleen reduce the abnormalities caused by CoVs.
In addition, the biological cell death in bats is attributed to a decrease in the biological neutrality of the NKG2/CD94 virus and a lower expression of the active class I molecules.
However, the oxygen species (ROS) from the digestion of the feces can inhibit the spread of CoVs and impair proofreading by exoribonuclease, resulting in selective suppression that results in highly pathogenic strains being introduced into a host cell.
Other CoVs can also grow by multiplying, producing previously unknown proteins or protein signatures that allow the host to adapt.
It is therefore not a coincidence that previously undetected HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs do not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in vectors such as bats and camels.
It is highly variable and does not cause any significant damage to the host.
Among them is the secret of how the uncontrolled transmission of disease causes the most deadly diseases in the human population.
The most dangerous symptoms are from a coughing up of the lungs and a cytocin storm, so that the more severe the coughing, the more dangerous the lung damage.
Compared to people without symptoms, the virus is less likely to multiply in the spread of CoV.
The same technique of eliminating the contact pathogen may be useful in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon effect is particularly strong in the kidneys.
Then, the action on type I interferon at least once the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been detected in humans must have been positive.
Similarly, induction of NLRP3 inflammasome activity in the pancreas is not effective.
In this sense, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in combination with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak follows a common pattern of origin between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While it has been found that beta-CoV shares 95% of the nucleotide with SARS-CoV, there is a variant of CoV that shares 96% of the nucleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
While mushrooms and other marketed animals have been found to hide a virus similar to SARS-CoV, the host virus that transmits SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified.
Strange similarities to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, suggesting that pangolin may act as a non-transmitter or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contain the genetic material that causes the final strain of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally synthesized.
CoVs have been identified in humans due to earlier outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has dramatically changed the understanding of the role of animal-derived and animal-infected HCoVs in the transmission of disease in humans.
Strong data has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans via non-transmitting host organisms.
As SARS-CoV infection is caused by human-to-animal contact in markets, closing raw markets and killing mosquitoes would be a significant step in curbing the spread of SARS.
Similarly, pangolins should be removed from raw food markets to prevent the transmission of animal-to-human diseases, with the aim of identifying the strains of pangolin beta-CoVs that are highly resistant to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via pangolins and other humanoid animals and how it is transmitted will be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in camels for quite some time.
Camels are vital for transportation and are a major source of meat, milk, skin, and wool for humans.
They are common in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore difficult to kill all camels due to MERS prevention, which is being done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the spread of MERS outbreaks, the vaccine for the disease should be developed to produce a MERS-CoV vaccine, in combination with other immunotherapy methods.
Since we cannot eliminate this virus, another virus can emerge and cause another infection.
A variant of CoV that transmits disease from animals to humans has spread in the wild.
In particular, it is a virulent CoV that has the potential to transmit diseases from animals to humans in a variety of ways.
There is a high probability that the CoVs that transmit disease from animals to humans will not be transmitted as a result of the emergence of new, rapidly transmitted CoVs and/or in the origin of the disease.
The practice of eating wild animals in some areas in China should be dropped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the midst of the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 pandemic, better preparedness and response plans are needed.
In fact, many of the germs have been on the earth for a long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to move on.
Although bats have a wide range of biological activities, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are advised to avoid them.
Regular monitoring is needed in human-like animals to better understand the evolution of CoVs and their genetic interactions which will be seen as important in preventing the spread of animal-to-human infections and infections in the future.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-to-human transmission is to use human-to-human biological agents that are host to animal-to-human transmission.
There are many unknowns about the origin of the animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is appropriate to observe the conditions in which bats and pangolins are distributed in their habitat.
Second, if the tick plays a role in direct transmission of disease to humans, then the way people interact with the tick should be considered.
Third, if an anthropomorphic animal is found to be a non-pathogenic organism, its interaction with other species including humans, bats and pangolins should be disclosed.
Finally, because many human-like animals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and testing for the disease should be undertaken.
If it is a rhinoceros, pangolin or other humanoid animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or other similar pathogenic viruses will be found in the host environment where the virus originates.
Recent studies on this topic will shed light on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Coordinating the basis for confirming suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team had released emergency guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of people with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and these guidelines were a demonstration of our expertise and a demonstration of how to effectively combat the outbreak globally.
Rather, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, the knowledge of which is increasingly based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical trials; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment are also being modified.
In this letter, we have responded to one of our guidelines and provided the most recent guidelines for determining  estimated and  confirmed based on the latest guidelines in the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version)) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused a disease, now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global health crisis.
To combat SARS-CoV-2, our team has developed a follow-up emergency response that was published online by Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
They have been well-loved since their publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our knowledge is increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical trials; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment are also changing.
According to the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, it has issued a total of seven releases with some conditions completely changed.
Our results were presented by Zhou and his colleagues, who developed a simple diagnostic method based on their findings in clinical practice.
Their work added to the evidence of our practices and highlighted this global problem.
We recognize and appreciate their fine work.
Rather, their work also needs to be updated in light of the new COVID-19 Testing and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Edition) and new research.
According to the seventh release (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected patient requires either combining one of the following medical history data with two clinical clinical data to make a final decision, or it is necessary to complete three clinical data if no clinical history is clear:
Patient history: (1) having been to or in Wuhan and its environs, or other areas where COVID-19 infection was detected within 14 days before symptoms were detected; (2) having been in close contact with people with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) having been in close contact with malaria or respiratory illness patients from Wuhan and its environs, or other areas where COVID-19 infection was detected within 14 days before symptoms were detected; (4) having been in close contact with infected patients (≥ 2 patients with fever and/or difficulty in breathing were detected within 2 weeks, such as in hospitals, offices, schools, etc.).
The clinical symptoms are: (1) malaria and/or difficulty breathing; (2) symptoms of a missed scan indicating an infection with COVID-19; (3) a white blood cell count indicating a normal, or decreased, lymphocyte count at the initial time.
A diagnosis should be made for a suspected patient with evidence of infection or a serum test as described below: (1) when a PCR test indicates positive SARS-CoV-2; (2) when viral whole genome sequencing has shown strong similarity to the novel coronavirus; (3) when serum testing indicates positive IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2; or when the serum serum of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has changed from negative to positive, or titer rising ≥4 days during the recovery period than during the severity period.
We note that early PCR tests for the detection of nucleic acid in urine or blood were added to the second issue (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Diagnosis from blood samples was added on the fourth issue (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); and evidence from body fluid tests was added on the seventh issue.
The change is based on the work of researchers trying to develop a nucleic acid-sensitive agent for rapid testing, together with samples from a blood sample, which increases the availability of different tests, and supports the presence of specific antibodies as a basis for confirmatory diagnosis.
In addition, there is ample evidence to remind us to be cautious of patients who show abnormal or unusual symptoms.
Therefore, the chart of Zhou and colleagues needs to be updated, as it showed a person without symptoms as low risk.
This score system also needs to be validated in other clinical treatments and other studies.
In summary, we hope that more evidence will emerge and invite readers to comment.
With the knowledge of the forecast and the evidence, we plan to follow and comply with the latest orders of your nations.
Our team will update our timeline to help.
Bangladesh reports five more deaths from COVID-19, the highest number of daily deaths
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed that five more people died from COVID-19 on the same day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has registered 114 cases and 33 cured cases at home.
A total of 17 people have died.
In a news release posted online, IEDCR official, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two of the deceased were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41-50 years old.
He also said that two of the people were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, an official of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport Obaidul Quader in a video announcement said that all international travel will be suspended for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The suspension of public transportation had started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on 4 April.
The movement of essential goods - medicines, fuel and food - was allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were reported on 8 March, with two people coming to the country from Italy and the wife of one of the people.
19 By August 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected one million people worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 million people have reportedly died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This was achieved on the same day Malawi confirmed its first case and at the same time Zambia reported one death from the coronavirus.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the countries that remained relatively free of coronavirus.
On Tuesday afternoon the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 new cases, including 79,332 new cases in a 24-hour period less than 4 a.m., Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases have been reported and at least 5,900 deaths have been reported.
CBS News quoted Johns Hopkins University as saying that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday from the coronavirus.
Worldwide, nations have declared strict measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city lockdown until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will be paid even if they do not go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the minimum term by 15 days; by a majority of 215 votes in favour, 10 against and 1 abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the coffee hour in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to an entire day; previously, coffee was available between 9 p.m. and 12 a.m.
Thailand served coffee between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the curfew until May 1.
Australian stores limit the number of bottles a person can buy at one time
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australia's nationwide supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles imposed a cap on the sale of chocolate bars if one or two of the country's largest stores were purchased.
ALDI also set a limit of one sister on Monday.
The ban was announced as a public message on the companies' Facebook pages.
Customers were advised to be prepared for COVID-19 fears as people were required to quarantine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of chicken purchases and home delivery to one pound a day.
The changes follow the first four-tier restrictions imposed by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March on both companies in the deal.
In Coles' March 8 letter, he noted that the four-day restrictions, "many stores remove within an hour of their arrival", and said the demand was "unprecedented", while ALDI, posting on Facebook on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales have skyrocketed in the past week according to a spokesperson for Woolworths.
Costco in Canberra also reduced the price of two sisters last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles asked the couriers to make more deliveries and increase the frequency, Woolworths ordered an increase in its inventory, and ALDI delivered more as planned on a special Wednesday to arrive early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase their stock but the restrictions imposed by local authorities on the number of cars being imported had made it difficult for them.
He expects to reduce the amount of money spent, as the ministers try to keep up with the demand and the short intervals.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the launch of the fast-food chain, some stores will not be able to do anything different on Wednesday.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores bring in merchandise every night.
He said that the mushrooms are so large that the prices in the stores are so low that when they are sold out, the remaining fat is left over in the oven and the feeling of scarcity is created.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that "Coles and Woolworths think [that] when there is a lot of supply in the market, when products like bottles and hand washes are [sold] in large quantities, the stacking can be reduced".
One of the cocoa workers who ate sheep said on Wednesday that the cocoa had been exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, the maker of the Fiberglass, and Solaris Paper, the maker of Sorbent, confirmed that they were working 24/7 to ensure they were competing with demand, according to a News.com.au report.
Real estate website Domain.com said that some vendors were giving free bottles of ham to the first winner of the Melbourne hammer, with the hammer sales being low because buyers had time off on the long Labor Day weekend.
In the Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin daily, there was a book with eight pages of text that had to be removed and used as a bookshelf.
Stores initially refused to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on 3 March saying they were not planning to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman adds that products are also on the market including masks, hand washing products, dry foods, hand soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the online marketplace Ocado was seen banning the purchase of Andres brand candies when a person buys between 2 and 12 candies.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19  as a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  as a global pandemic.
Although the term "global crisis" refers to the extent to which a disease has spread, not to how dangerous some cases are, WHO suggested that governments should take action:
"All countries can change the way this global crisis is spreading.
If countries could isolate, test, treat, isolate, monitor and mobilize people on this issue", said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
"We are deeply concerned by the spread of this disease and its dangers and the extreme indifference".
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the pandemic was "unexpected".
"Other than the virus, no respiratory virus has been identified since the outbreak to date anywhere in the world", he said, in a statement broadcast on CNN on Tuesday.
Ghebreyesus expressed similar sentiments, saying that "we have never seen a global outbreak of coronavirus".
He added: "And we have not seen a global problem that can be solved".
The new global pandemic status came after the WHO decided in January to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency.
The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, described the outbreak as "a never-ending, unforgettable event".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVOID-19 worldwide, of which 4,600 had died.
The 2019-20 global coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 pandemic (COVID-19), caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory tract known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency on 30 January 2020, and declared a global emergency on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, 1.61 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories and approximately 97,000 people have died.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate is estimated at 4% in China, while globally it is 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, nausea and shortness of breath.
The complications of this disease may include pneumonia and severe respiratory problems.
The time from infection and symptoms is about five days but ranges from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or therapeutic treatment for the virus.
Primary treatment is focused on symptoms and minimal relief.Suggestions for self-diagnosis include, washing hands, covering your lips with a mask, social distancing, monitoring and self-isolation if you suspect you have the disease.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, cafes, workplace safety measures and lockouts.
The resolution also condemned the economic and social disruption of the world, the extension or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the creation of a shortage of goods caused by the mass shopping.
Schools and universities closed at national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of students worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of hateful attacks and discrimination against Chinese, other East and Southeast Asian people or people like them from areas where the virus is most prevalent.
With the closure of transport and large industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a small number of cases of unidentified coronavirus as of 31 December 2019, and investigations began in early January 2020.
The cases were identified in contact with seafood in Huanan (Seafood Wholesale Market) and the virus is thought to have spread from animals to humans.
The virus that caused the outbreak is SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus similar to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first case was later identified on 1 December 2019, and the person was not found to be related to a raw material market.
Of the cases first reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed news source from the South China Morning Post reported that the previous case on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei province, may have been the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that while new cases had declined in China but rapidly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases inside China for the first time ever.
There may have been some misrepresentation of the exact number of patients especially those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, a small number of cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under who make up 2.4% of the global cases.British Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the population in the UK may have the virus before a serious outbreak in humans.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and tested positive for the virus according to official data.
As of 23 March, no country had a population of more than 3%, and many countries have a zero-tests policy for those with low test scores, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A survey released on 16 March showed that in China, as of 23 January, 86% of confirmed cases had not been vaccinated, and that the unregistered cases accounted for 79% of the registered cases.
Statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that the number of cases in Italy was much higher than previously reported.
The initial estimate of the baseline number of variations (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the figure could be as high as 5.7.
Most people who contract COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with a maximum of 14 days in the general population.
As of 10 April 2020, 97,000 people have reportedly died from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of the deaths were among those over 60 years of age, and 75% had other conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The highest official death toll from COVID-19 is reported by those who tested positive for COVID according to official data.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher because there may be no deaths without testing - at home, in nursing homes, etc.
A semi-annual report from Italy found that the total number of deaths during the outbreak was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID figures.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [death toll] is not accurate", and confirmed this with surveys in the United States. Misdiagnosis is common during outbreaks such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first case outside China was reported on February 1 in the Philippines, while the first case outside Asia was reported in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside China, more than 12 people had died in each of these countries, Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on nearly every continent except Antarctica.
These figures vary from region to region and time period and are based on the number of tests, the quality of treatment, available treatments, the time since the onset of the disease, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate relative to the total number of patients was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimated death rate relative to the total number of cases decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms at the beginning of 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms at the beginning after 1 February 2020).The measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of people tested who die from a particular disease, and the infection rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of those tested (and untested) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow certain people from the time they are infected to the time the patient is exposed.
Several researchers have tried to estimate the population of certain populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the prevalence of HIV infection is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The high estimates on this scale are consistent with the results of the first COVID-19 test in Germany, and statistical studies that confirm the test do not estimate mortality.
WHO estimates that this global epidemic can be prevented.
The progression and duration of the disease are unknown and may vary from one location to another.
"A new infectious disease, if left untreated, can spread and become a disease if not treated", says Maciej Boni of Penn State University.
But it is almost impossible to predict at this time when it will happen".
Senior adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said it "could be over by the end of June" if all countries can be encouraged to follow WHO recommendations and practices to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will be spreading, possibly for a year or two".
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, the interim and follow-up will take "until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
"I think the coronavirus, because of its rapid spread, will be completely eradicated", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, "and it could become a temporary pandemic with a recurrence every year".
Its return will depend on its common ancestry and genetics.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be subtle and patients may not show any symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are malaria (88%) and dry chest (68%).
Rare symptoms include dizziness, excessive sweating, shortness of breath, joint pain, sore throat, headache, wheezing/fear, vomiting, hemoptysis, runny nose, or cyanosis. WHO says that one in six people suffer from chronic illness and difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists early symptoms as shortness of breath, chest pain, feeling dizzy, difficulty moving, and facial or oral contact; immediate medical attention is required when symptoms occur. Progressive illness can lead to severe seizures, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some patients may not show any symptoms, but if they are tested positive, then researchers have recommended that those who come into contact with confirmed cases should be closely monitored and quarantined.
China's estimate of the prevalence of symptoms is between a few and 44%.
The incubation period (the time from infection to onset of symptoms) is usually from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.In the case of a non-confirmed sample, estimates of the number of people who become immunocompromised with COVID-19 were initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some of the mechanisms of disease transmission are not yet understood.
The disease is thought to be spread by contact with infected individuals and by contact with a fluid transmitted by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; and the contact is between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that the uncovered gravel pits lead to a well that runs 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be spread by a fluid that remains in the air for a long time, which can be released during speech.Such fluid can also be released by breathing in and during speech, although the virus is not usually transported through the air.
The saliva can be passed through the mouth or nose of nearby people or can be absorbed into the lungs.
Some treatments such as radiation therapy and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause a hole in the urethra to pop out and thus spread the disease through the air.
It can also be spread by contact with infected objects, including the body, the face, the joints, or the mouth.
While there is a fear that it may spread into the wild, the risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spreading in a negative manner.The virus is most likely to spread in the first three days after symptoms appear, although spread is possible before symptoms appear and in the final stages of the outbreak.
People have been tested for the disease three days before any signs of transmission are detected, even before severe symptoms are seen.
There have been few reports of confirmed cases of asymptomatic infection, but transmission from asymptomatic individuals has been observed in some countries by monitoring the patient's contact with other people.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not clear how the virus is spread, the average person vaccinates between two and three people.The virus can survive on surfaces for several hours to several days.
In particular, the virus was found to survive for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and a 304-degree stove, one day on cardboard and four hours on paper.
However, this varies depending on the source of the air and the temperature.Pets and pets have also been tested for COVID-19.
There are no reports of animal transmission to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, as well as touching objects that are suspected of being infected.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a previously unknown virus, first identified in three people with a virus that is similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus found in Wuhan.
All previously unknown SARS-CoV-2 viruses are found in mosquito-like coronaviruses.Outside the body, the virus is killed by household soap, which kills the protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the first SARS-CoV virus detected.
It is thought to have originated in animals and passed on to humans.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus in its genetic makeup is similar to the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) with two bat-derived strains.
It is about 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bacterial strains in its samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolins and the humans.
To date, the most extensive genome comparison has found 92% of the genetic material shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to confirm that the pangolin is a non-communicable virus.
The presence of the virus can be detected at the initial stage, but confirmation is usually made by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the affected tissue or in computed tomography (CT imaging).
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has shown that CT use is more prudent than PCR, although it is not as clear-cut, and the imaging parts are often lost to other infections and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should be used to screen for or be used as a primary screening test for COVID-19".
WHO released the results of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing may be done on samples of the respiratory tract or blood.
The results are usually visible within a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal swab although a urine swab may also be used.Many laboratories and companies are developing blood tests to detect the immune system.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these had been scientifically proven to be effective enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, the blood test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use in only approved clinical trials.
Symptoms on radiographs and CT scans include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is working on an online collection of images from confirmed cases.
Due to the association with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR cannot be reliable in detecting COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and showed that even imaging is not a reliable diagnosis, suggesting that it should be used with caution when screening for infected areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks are designed to capture viral images using radiographs and CT scans.
Prevention measures include maintaining a clean environment, washing hands, avoiding touching the face, nose, or mouth without washing hands, and picking or picking up a piece of cloth or paper and putting it directly in a garbage can.
Those who may be ill have been advised to wear masks when walking from home.
Social distancing is also recommended to prevent the spread of disease.Many governments have restricted or advised people not to travel unless it is impossible to travel to or from areas affected by the disease.
Instead, the virus has reached a point of spread in a continuous range in many countries around the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some people in communities do not know where or how they were infected. Nurses/doctors caring for a potential patient are advised to be cautious, to contact the person with caution, and to mask themselves. Tracking people with whom a person has come into contact is an important tool for health professionals to identify the source of the infection and to avoid further spread of the disease.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has led to a suspicion of privacy issues with Amnesty International and more than 100 other agencies releasing documents to limit such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been deployed or are being prepared for emergency use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than 20 official groups were advising on privacy issues such as using Bluetooth to connect a mobile user to other phones.
Users receive information about whether they have been in close contact with a person who has been tested positive for COVID-19.Many misinformation circulates about how to prevent infection; for example, washing the nose and mouth with water, but none of these are effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working hard to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water at least 20 minutes at a time, especially after using the toilet or if their hands are actually visible; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which kills the skin.
The CDC further recommends using disinfectant water containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching the face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected using a special aqueous solution (in one minute if the material is made of steel and is in contact with an infected person), which contains 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other aqueous agents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, do not work well.
The CDC recommends that if a person is suspected or confirmed to have COVID in an area such as an office or child care center, all areas such as offices, restrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, laptops, laptops, and ATM machines used by an infected person should be disinfected.
Health authorities recommend people cover their mouths and noses with a hand-wash or tissue immediately.
Masks are recommended for those who may be ill, as wearing masks may limit the length and frequency of fluid excretion when speaking, smelling or squeezing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how masks should be used.
According to Stephen Griffin, a researcher in virology at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a face mask can reduce the likelihood of people touching their face and is a major source of transmission of disease if the person does not wash their hands properly.
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear masks during high-risk situations such as caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it believes that wearing masks can help people avoid face contact.
Many countries have begun to require masks for all.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of cloth, while China recommends using disposable medical masks, especially when approaching people (one meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a mask when riding public transport or when living in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand are encouraging people to wear masks at home and to wash daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited people from leaving the house without wearing a mask or a nose and mouth mask.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone to wear a mask when entering a store.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-Monday, on 1 April ordered passengers on trains and buses in urban areas to wear masks.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear masks when leaving home, and encourages people to make masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy them.
Eyeglasses have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing includes measures to prevent the spread of disease by reducing contact with others.
The measures include quarantines; restrictions on travel; and closures of schools, workplaces, parks, parks and shops.
Individuals may want to reduce the distance they can stay at home, reduce their movement, avoid crowded places, greet others without touching them, and even avoid contact with others.
Many governments now require isolation of people in affected areas.
The maximum number of people vaccinated by US government and health agencies has dropped from 250 people (when there are no COVID-19 cases in the area) to 50 people, and then to just 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany cancelled gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with other health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and dysfunction are at high risk and the CDC advises them to stay at home as much as possible, especially in areas with high infection. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began using the terms "isolating" and "self-isolation" to announce that the goal is to reduce social contact but to extend the social distancing to other people or to others.
The use of the word "separation" has led to the idea that people should be completely separate from each other, rather than encouraging them to keep in touch with each other by other means.
This is to encourage them to have sex only with the person with whom they are living, who is not infected or who has no symptoms of the virus.
Social distancing is recommended for those who have tested positive for COVID-19 and those who suspect they have the virus.
Health authorities have issued individual quarantine orders.Many governments are mandating or recommending self-quarantine for all people in affected areas.
The strictest quarantine orders have been issued in high-risk areas.
Those who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and those who have traveled to countries or regions where the disease is widespread are advised to quarantine themselves for 14 days from the time they may have been in contact with the disease.
The strategy in the first instance is to combat or prevent it.
Prevention is carried out at the beginning of an outbreak and aims to monitor and isolate those affected and to bring about additional measures to control and prevent the spread of disease in the remaining population.
If it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of disease, then the focus is on fighting the disease: there are measures to slow the spread and prevent the consequences for the health system and society.
The combination of prevention and weapons can be used simultaneously.
Reduction requires intensive efforts to reverse the recurrence of the disease in the event of a lower prevalence. One of the ways to combat the recurrence of the disease is to try to reduce the spread of the disease by flattening the curve.
This reduces the risk of busy health services and gives more time to work on vaccines.
Non-medical strategies to help control emerging diseases include, individual measures to prevent infection, such as hand washing, wearing masks, and self-quarantine; community measures to reduce distances such as closing schools and cancelling mass gatherings; encouraging people to participate in such activities; and community sanitation measures such as sanitation. Anti-virus measures were later implemented in China, such as quarantining all public places and imposing restrictions on urban movement.
Other countries have also introduced other measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced a public quarantine, and warned travellers of illnesses.
Singapore helped those who had quarantined themselves when ill by giving them money and those who refused were given a big hug.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and vaccines for people who have concealed vaccines.A study conducted in the UK and the US shows that both prevention (reducing rather than slowing the spread of disease) and mitigation (preventing the spread of disease) are major challenges.
More effective disease control measures can reduce the growing need for medical care by 2/3 and death by half, but at the same time result in thousands of deaths and hospitalisation.
Prevention may be more effective but should be done as long as the virus is not spreading to humans (or until a vaccine is developed, if that is the first step), but the disease may return if the results are confirmed.
Long-term efforts to combat disease are costly and costly.
There is no approved vaccine for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop a vaccine, including clinical trials of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking beverages, and resting may help to alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the hazard, ventilation, water and ventilation equipment may be required.
The use of steroids can complicate the situation.
Several compounds that have been previously used to treat other viral infections are being studied for their use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also noted that "some of the traditional treatments" may alleviate some of the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting to the needs of COVID-19 patients as defined by WHO is a key step in addressing the emergence of the disease.
ECDC and the European office of WHO have issued clinical and primary care guidance for the implementation of various phases including focusing on clinical trials for COVID-19, eliminating non-emergency procedures where possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, and increasing specialized care through staff training and increasing the number of support equipment in hospitals.
There are different theories about the origin of the first patient (called patient zero).
The first case of an unidentified coronavirus was reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily increasing.
These were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, its origin is in the animal.An unidentified pneumonia strain was detected on 26 December by a doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, which reported Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues that there was a possible outbreak of the "SARS coronavirus".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were charged by the police for spreading lies and another, Ai Fen, was charged by his superiors for beating the drums.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a statement on 31 December informing WHO.
Several cases with unknown viruses had already been notified to Wuhan authorities to begin investigating in early January.When the outbreak began, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, with the spread being facilitated by the Chinese New Year celebrations and the fact that Wuhan is a busy city and a busy railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, official data showed that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms as of 20 January 2020.On 26 March, the United States surpassed China in the number of confirmed cases worldwide.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 cases had been detected worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died and 364,000 people had recovered.
About 200 countries have had at least one case.
As a result of the crisis in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and have imposed border controls.
Some countries have implemented measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including quarantines (also known as curfews, curfews, or lockdowns) and lockdowns.As of 2 April, 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were on some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people were on lockdowns in the Philippines, 59 million people were on lockdowns in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were on lockdowns in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of disability and the number rose to 2.6 billion people two days later, nearly a third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 is thought to have been detected on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report states that the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with an unknown group of viral infections on December 26, after which the hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC authorities on December 27.
The first genetic test of the patient samples on 27 December 2019 showed positive for the SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When the announcement was made, the Wuhan medical community was alerted by the police for spreading rumors of an outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission previously said that there is no "clear data" on human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a massive campaign described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to combat the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the worst quarantine in human history, a health lockdown was announced on 23 January to halt travel to and from Wuhan, and was extended to about 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in several places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
A hospital was later built, called the Leishenshan Hospital, to treat more patients.
In addition to the new hospital, China also relocated 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and football stadiums and temporary clinics.On 26 January, the government imposed additional measures to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, including travel documentation for travelers and extending the Spring Holiday celebrations.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
Hong Kong and Macau have imposed strict restrictions, especially on schools and universities.
Work-related measures have been implemented in many parts of China.
Restrictions on movement were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transportation was altered, and the old tourist sites were temporarily closed.
Restrictions on movement of people were imposed in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half of the population) were subjected to various restrictions.As the epidemic spread worldwide in March, Chinese authorities imposed strict measures to contain the virus and to ban foreign travel to China.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine on all foreigners entering China.On 23 March, China had only one case reported in the previous five days and the patient was a passenger who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.

Many provinces have required Christian elders to stay at home instead of Sunday Mass; some churches have placed prayers on the radio, on the Internet, or on television; and others have even arranged for drive-in worship.
When the Roman Catholic Church in Rome closed its churches and the St. Peter's Square and reduced the number of pilgrims, other churches also canceled their services and reduced the number of meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, shrines, and temples.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and mosques were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its citizens from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the worst disruption to the sporting calendar since World War II.
Several major sporting events were cancelled or added to, including the 2019 UEFA Champions League, the 2019 UEFA Premier League, the 2019 UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019 NBA, and the 2019 NHL.
The pandemic has disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the Games will be rescheduled after 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021".Casinos and other sports venues around the world were closed and table games tournaments were also extended or canceled.
This has led to a surge in online gambling, with online gambling sites now reporting a sharp rise in their participation rates. The entertainment industry has also been hit hard, with many music groups cancelling or canceling their concert tours.
Many large theaters, including those on Broadway, also canceled their performances.
Some artists have tried other ways to publish and share their work online instead of the traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or web-based "festivals" where artists can sing, broadcast, and promote their work.
On the internet, the information about the coronavirus has spread so much that many people are starting to make fun of it and play around with ignorance.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a marked increase in prejudice, racism, and racial discrimination against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, as well as people from the worst affected areas of Europe, the United States and other countries.
There are reports of terror, exploitation, and violence in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from Tuesday (as most cases are still in China) have shown racial discrimination against groups of Chinese worldwide who should be vaccinated or subject to what is considered fair compensation.
Some African countries have also seen rising anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have said they are discriminated against because of their ethnicity.
There has been support for Chinese, online and elsewhere, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
After the virus spread to other countries, the people of Italy, the first European country to be severely affected by COVID-19, also began to face discrimination and discrimination.Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed documents calling for banning Chinese from entering their countries in an effort to curb the disease.
In Japan, the slogan #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a hit on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian citizens in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing acts of discrimination, harassment, and exploitation.
Gurdwaras President Donald Trump has been widely criticized for calling the coronavirus "the Chinese virus", a term critics have called racist and hateful towards China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals in Wuhan to Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China, studying in major Indian cities reportedly underwent a coronavirus-related lockdown.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had ruined the environment and "that is why God punished them".
The statement was later criticized by the Chinese ambassador in Kolkata, who called it "a mistake".[31] In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents have been fueled by the epidemic, with foreigners being labeled "foreign trash" and monitored for "disposal".
Many newspapers with translated pages have removed them and have included coronavirus information in some or all of them.
Many scientific journal publishers have made free publications on the disease.
Some scientists decided to quickly share their findings on a simple website like bioRxiv.

Tests for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus include both viral and antibody detection techniques that are performed when an infected person is infected.
The presence of the virus in the test samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test was performed by testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA alone.
It is used to detect a new or a previous infection.
Antibody testing (serology) can be used to diagnose disease or to determine the number of people infected.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected, including those with mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization or those who do not show symptoms.
The exact number of deaths and the human susceptibility to the disease can be determined by this method.
Due to insufficient testing, as of March 2020 no country had any reliable information on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are significant variations in the number of people tested worldwide.
These differences may affect the mortality rates, which may be high in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the test can be performed on samples of saliva obtained from various processes, including nasal and urinary catheterization or a sample of the test organism.
Results are usually obtained in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing for reliable urinary tract infection is only performed in the first week of infection.
The virus can then disappear in the esophagus while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For patients who are tested in the second week, test samples may be taken from the airways using a suction catheter or a filter may also be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in February 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), resulting in 250,000 test kits provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom was also developing a test system on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene in all beta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene is found only in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency authorization from China's National Medical Products Administration to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing its 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel test to government trials through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in the older test kit system showed results that were not conclusive due to faulty reagents, as well as a problem in the testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in less than 100 samples per day being processed by the end of February 2020.
Dual-use testing was not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and until then state and local testing was not allowed to begin testing.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization process.The US clinical trials began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced that COVID-19 testing was being conducted nationwide based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide by 9 March 2020.
They did not announce a limit on the quantity; collection and processing of samples must be done according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and published by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test kit was registered with the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic developed a COVID-19 test.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a test that could be performed in 3.5 hours in quantity, allowing one test kit to test approximately 4,128 people in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency approval to Abbott Laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had already granted similar approvals to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 August 2020, Cepheid also received emergency approval from the FDA to conduct a 45-minute test.
The FDA has tested the use of isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since the system does not require any temperature changes, it can produce a virus-positive test in just five minutes and a non-virus test in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott hopes to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.This monoclonal antibody test is targeting the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus being developed in Taiwan, which is expected to provide results in 15 to 20 minutes as is the case with rapid flu tests.
A review of the documentation in March 2020 concluded that "this chest imaging test is not effective in the early stages, and CT results may be present with no obvious symptoms".
Commonly seen in CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities as well as peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan in the early phase of the outbreak showed that CT scans were much faster than PCR, although less accurate, as many of its images were misleading and could lead to other infections.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology advised that "CT should not be used to diagnose or perform a preliminary test for COVID-19".
One of the most commonly used antibodies is IgM and IgG.
Tests can be used to detect the virus in humans from 7 days of symptoms, to detect strains, and to monitor the number of infected people.Tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or in point-of-care testing (PoCT).
High-throughput automated systems in several trials will be able to perform this testing but availability will depend on the quantity of each system released.
For CLT, single-test blood is usually used, although alternative blood may be used to monitor the blood clotting process.
In PoCT, a single blood test is usually obtained by a skin scan.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction step is not required before testing.On 26 March 2020, the FDA received 29 notified entities as indicated and can therefore now distribute their own antibody testing kits.
On 7 April 2020, only one test was passed by the FDA in the emergency approval process.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their diagnostic devices, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
They can test hundreds of samples in a few hours which is therefore much faster than traditional PCR tests for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected within 14 days of a person being infected.In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased were working properly.
Hong Kong has introduced a policy whereby people suspected of being infected stay at home, "emergency department will give patient a sample collection glass", patient will scan it, send the card and get the results of the test later.The British NHS announced that it is testing a suspected virus testing system at home, which eliminates the risk of patient vaccination if they go to hospital or if the ambulance is used.In the process of testing for COVID-19 in suspected patients when they are at home, the doctor collects samples following the necessary precautions.
Drive-through centers have enabled South Korea to test more people than any other country, with the fastest population ever.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it could test about 12,000 people a day in the repatriation process and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the insurance if the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to test 160,000 people every week.
On 19 March, a mass self-isolation test was conducted in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the number of people tested in Germany was not known, as only positive results were announced.
The initial trial study showed that in the week of 12/2020 a total of 483,295 samples were tested up to week 12/2020 including 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a system to test samples from 64 patients at once, combining samples with retest samples to determine whether they were infected.In Wuhan a small 2000sq-meter test called "Huo-Yanpolo" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English, Uganda) was developed, which could produce up to 10,000 samples in 5 days, with a total of 5 BGI in 2020 per day.
The construction work was monitored by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasted 5 days, and estimates suggest that Hubei would have had a 47% infection rate and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled if the testing facility had not been built.
The Wuhan trial was quickly followed by Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the daily test population was 50,000. Non-commercial multiplexed designs developed by Origami Assays were released that can detect COVID-19 in 1122 patient samples using only 93 tests. These techniques can be used in small tests without the need for robots.
As of Wednesday, shortages of test-tube drugs have become a barrier to costly testing in the EU and the UK and US.
This has led some researchers to experiment with the process of preparing samples by first exposing them to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to produce RNA genomes for further analysis.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was testing its population for Coronavirus more than any other country, and was aiming to expand testing to a wider population in the country.
This was achieved by combining the self-testing system with the purchase of mass-testing equipment from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
The trial, built in 14 days, has the capacity to perform thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to operate outside China.
Different test kits targeting different types of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has recommended a German product to release tests for developing countries that lack the capacity to produce them.
The German vaccine was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not released until 28 January, delaying testing in the US. China and the US had problems with the accuracy of the diagnostic tools in the early stages of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to produce enough to satisfy the need for and approval of health professionals for testing.
In contrast, experts say mass testing in South Korea helped slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The ability to test, especially in private experiments, was developed decades ago by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, World Health recommended continued testing as the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection.The need for mass testing due to the continued spread of the virus has led to a shortage of private trial participants in the United States, and a shortage of testing materials.
In March 2020 China reported that there were problems with the accuracy of the test equipment.
In the United States, the CDC's testing kit was "problematic"; the government removed restrictions that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that the false results could be due to a failure to collect samples or to use reliable tests.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw the results of the tests, which included the ones provided to Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the tests the Czech Republic bought from China gave negative results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million tests from China which were found to be incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovič said that the tests were being sold in the Danube.Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the tests Turkey bought from China had "a high potential for error" and "were not used".The UK purchased 3.5 million tests from China but in early April 2020 announced that these could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and tracking of close contacts with SARS-CoV-2, was successful.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vigo, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy occurred, conducted two tests on all 3,400 people, ten days apart.
Approximately half of the people who were infected had no symptoms, and all those who were infected were quarantined.
As they were denied access to the public, the possibility of new infections was suspended.
Stronger contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine have helped to control the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore more than in other developed countries, but without closing down many facilities such as food stores and small shops.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began telling citizens to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the holiday on 23 March.
Many other countries have also been successful in combating the disease by identifying close contacts, banning entry, testing, and quarantining patients, but without using excessive quarantine, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have found that countries with the highest number of tests, compared to the number of deaths, have the lowest death rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those with few or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that lack testing capacity and countries that lack sufficient COVID-19 data send their first five samples of the first ten live COVID-19 patients to one of the 16 WHO-interviewed testing sites to confirm their testing.
Of the 16 studies surveyed, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the table below, the percentage of patients tested is based on the national testing system.
A nation that only tests hospitalized patients will have a higher percentage of cases tested than a nation that tests the general population, whether they have symptoms or not, if all else remains the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap and detergent at "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea, which are spread by mouthwash.
People can also contract diarrheal illnesses like the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their face, nose, or mouth (i.e., cold areas).
The five most important times of the day to wash hands with soap are when work is most needed: before or after using the toilet, after cleaning the baby's back or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and after preparing food or touching raw meat or fish.
If soap and water are not available, hand sanitizers can be used with a washcloth.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after meals.
Before and after caring for a patient.
After changing the toilet or cleaning the baby after going to the toilet.
After harvesting, harvesting or picking.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal excrement.
Medical hand hygiene is the practice of cleaning hands in a medical context.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical treatment can reduce the risk of infection.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to kill germs (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and to remove chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially true for people who work in the food or healthcare industry, but it is also good for everyone.
Handwashing has many benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other communicable diseases; avoiding contaminants; reducing the risk of communicable diseases;
reducing the number of deaths of children born at home.
A 2013 study found that increased hand-washing habits may slightly improve the growth rate of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the number of child deaths from infectious diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by behavioral changes, such as hand washing and soap.
This simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by as much as 50%.
Handwashing initiatives can reduce emissions by up to a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to low-income communities.
A 48% reduction in exposure can be achieved by handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to avoid exposure to communicable diseases, as practiced in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Tuberculosis, the most common chronic disease, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia kill about 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap before and after eating and using toilets is a common practice that can save lives more than vaccines or treatments, reducing the number of deaths from diarrheal diseases by a quarter.
Handwashing is often accompanied by other hygiene practices as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) initiative.
Hand washing also prevents the spread of skin diseases called rubella, which is spread by direct contact.
The least harmful part of washing hands regularly is to touch the skin and dry it.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause skin rash, redness, and a condition called hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among doctors.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five main times during the day when hand washing with soap is essential to reduce oral infection: after using the toilet (sneezing, self-washing), after cleaning the baby (changing the diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or touching raw meat or fish.
Other situations where proper hand washing is necessary to avoid spreading disease include before or after touching a toothpick or a dog; after urinating, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal droppings or animal waste; and after touching waste.
In many lands, hand washing with soap is a low priority.
A handwashing study in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia was the top handwasher with 97 percent; the United States was in the middle with 77 percent; and China was the lowest at 23 percent. There are currently many behavioral changes to increase the practice of handwashing with soap during this critical time.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is one of the examples of actions to promote children's health and education.
Two-yearly intake of disinfectants, including daily hand washing with soap, daily tooth brushing with fluoride, are the main priorities of the national program.
This arrangement has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of the bacteria from the skin is supplemented by adding soap to the water.
The main function of soap is to reduce water resistance, and to allow it to dissolve more quickly.
Water alone cannot cleanse the skin because fats and proteins, which are part of the natural soil, are not dissolved in water.
Rather, it is aided by the flow of water.
Kitchen soap, because it is recycled, may retain some of the germs from the first use.
A small study on the transport of bacteria left over from baking soap has shown that it is difficult to transport bacteria because they are found in the feces.
The CDC also noted that "water soap is the best when it is washed without touching".
People who care about their health are strongly encouraged to use antibacterial soaps.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or disinfectants kills germs.
Instead, soap contains an antibiotic, triclosan, which contains many antibiotics.
Therefore, even if antibiotics are not selected by antibiotic detergents, they may not work as well as they are claimed to.
In addition to skin-protective ingredients, various medications may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin-softening agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive study from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that soap is as effective as the antibiotic soap triclosan in preventing infection and removing germs from the hands.
Hot water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill germs.
Bacteria grow rapidly at a temperature of 37 °C.
Instead, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing soil-bound bacteria and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water does not change the number of germs on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990's and the first half of the 21st century, alcohol-based hand sanitizers (also called alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a solid substance such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to make them more viscous, or a humectant such as glycerin to make them more fluid, or foam to facilitate the use of the product and reduce the alcohol's viscosity.
Adding dissolved hydrogen-peroxide increases its disinfection capacity.Hand sanitizers with alcohol content of less than 60 to 95% are effective in killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (3.5 log reduction, compared to 35 decibel reduction) in the hand after 30 seconds of use and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria in the hand after 1 minute of use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against norovirus (or Norwalk) strains, which are the most common cause of gastroenteritis.Hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to rinse or rinse both hands.
The front and back of each finger and the fingertip area are soaked for about 30 seconds until the water, vomit or feces are removed.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, with both hands rubbed.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing over using a sanitizer, especially if the fingertips appear to be dirty.
The widespread use of these products is based on their ease of use and quick disinfection; however, they are not intended to replace the traditional hand washing method unless soap and water are available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based sanitizers can dry the skin unless you add skin conditioners and/or softeners.
Dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding disinfectants to the skin or other skin treatments.
In medical studies, alcohol-based sanitizers with skin conditioners caused less skin irritation than soap or disinfectants.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or allergic to alcohol or alcohol-based sanitizers are rare.
The low incidence of irritant contact dermatitis attracted attention compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Although effective, unwashed hand sanitizers are not quick to clean, only disinfect.
This is why sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in fighting the spread of many bacteria, as bacteria often remain on the hands.
Non-alcoholic sanitizers are highly dependent on the ingredients, and historically have not been as effective as alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, compounds containing benzalkonium chloride have been found to be more effective and more potent in killing bacteria with use than alcohol, which has been found to be less potent with increased use, possibly due to its toxicity to the skin.
Many people in developing lands have little access to soap, so they use only ashes and soil.
Dust or soil may be more resilient than plain water, but it may not be as resilient as soap.
The problem is that contaminated soil or dust can increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it is alkaline when mixed with water.
WHO has recommended using ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
Proper handwashing recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease includes the following:
Do not wash your hands with hot or cold water.
The flow of water is recommended because the water that is not flowing can carry germs, and the temperature of the water does not make a difference.
Bring a towel in your hands and a little soap, including the back of your fingers, in the shoulder, and under the armpit.
Soap cleanses the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands safely with soap rather than with plain water.
I bathed for at least 20 minutes.
Washing hands helps to keep the skin moisturized, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and prolonged washing of hands removes many germs.
Stir it gently in running water.
Stirring in unstable water can cause the hands to become infected again.
Wash your hands with a towel or leave them dry.
The most commonly neglected areas are the cheeks, the gums, the stomach, and the intestines.
The seedlings planted on the seedlings can hide the germs.
Soft pads are worn to protect the hands; dry skin can cause skin lesions which can increase the risk of infection.
There are many other techniques that can enable hand washing such as tap water/no soap is available to try to drain water from a hanging or a reservoir and/or use ash if required in developing countries.In situations where water is not available (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are techniques to reduce water use, such as "tippy-taps" and other inexpensive techniques.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique that uses a cable-bound, hand-held tap to draw a small amount of water and rub it into the hands of a soap maker.
Proper hand washing is an important part of hand hygiene, but there is some disagreement about the best way to wash hands in a public toilet.
Many studies have found that paper towels are more efficient than the electrical towels found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, compared the cleanliness of paper towels, hot-air hand dryers, and new jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air conditioner, the number of bacteria was found to increase by 194% on the hands and 254% on the hands.
Washing hands in hot air caused a 42% increase in the number of bacteria on the hands and 15% on the hands.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the number of bacteria was reduced on the hands by 76% and on the hands by 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether the ability of the toilet user to disinfect and the condition of the toilet caused by different types of hand drying.
A high-pressure air conditioner, which blows at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), could blow germs out of the hands and into the lungs and could infect other toilet users and disperse them into the toilet at a distance of 2 meters.
Using a hot air conditioner, the bacteria were blown within 0.25 meters of the target.
Paper towels did not show the potential for transmitting pathogens.In 2005, in a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand-drying methods were studied.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand washing:
There are many hand washers, and hand washing has been compared to washing hands with paper towels.
Hand washing with soft paper is used for walking without soap and water.
Alcoholic sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing became a popular practice long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospitals.
Medical staff are being reminded to wash their hands in the hospital by electronic devices.
One study found that infection was reduced when the machines were used.
Washing hands to prevent infection should be done in at least 15 seconds, using a small amount of soap and water to rinse and wash each part of the hand.
The fingers should be tied together with the fingers that are attached to them.
If there is a shortage of waste, a hot brush may be used to remove it.
Since bacteria can remain in the water on the hands, it is important to stir them well and wipe them with a clean towel.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to seal the water (and open the drain if necessary).
This prevents the hand from getting infected again.
The importance of hand washing in a clinical setting is to remove germs and avoid spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing is still a problem in most hospitals, with many doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, causing them to inject with disinfectants.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce blood-borne infection from the body by 66 percent.The World Health Organization published a paper on handwashing and hand sanitizer in hospitals.
The manual of the department is also available on its website for public comment.
A positive review was made by Whitby and his colleagues.
There are devices that can measure and verify the cleanliness, if necessary to ensure compliance with the legal requirements.
The World Health Organization has a "Five Standards" for hand washing:
after contact with blood/body fluid
when touching a non-toxic object, and
after contact with the patient. Using a soap containing antibiotics (medicated or antimicrobial soap) will help to keep the soap in good working condition.
This disinfection may be necessary before surgery or in situations where the virus is highly resistant to antibiotics. Hand sanitizer before surgery, a removable tape, washing with chlorhexidine or iodine, a washing towel, and a cleaning brush or other cleaning agent.
All excuses must be removed.
This task requires washing the hands and half-hands to the elbow for 2-6 minutes.
Long-term (ten minutes) washing of the hands is not necessary.
When shaking, the water from the hands should not rub against the hands.
After hand washing, the hands are cleaned with a freshly baked cloth and the garment is cleaned with a little cloth.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is advisable to wash your hands or use a disinfectant before and after contact with the patient.
Prevention of staphylococcal infections in hospitals was found to be the best benefit of handwashing in the first 20%, while the other benefit was found to be less when handwashing increased by more than 35%.
Washing with soap increases the risk of bacterial infection in food by more than three times compared to washing with antibacterial soap.A comparison of washing hands with alcohol-based sanitizer and washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds each showed that washing hands with alcohol-based sanitizer reduced bacteria by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
Instead, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based sanitizers in reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands.Improvements to hand hygiene in hospitals may include training staff on hand washing, increasing alcohol-containing sanitizers, and providing written or oral reminders to staff.
There is a need for further research into which of these approaches is most effective in different clinical situations.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is seen as a cost-effective, health-promoting, and nutritionally beneficial practice.
However, the lack of water, soap or hand washing equipment in homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge to the spread and promotion of hand washing practices.
For example, in most rural parts of Africa hand washing faucets near any private or public toilet are scarce, even though inexpensive hand washing facilities are available.
Rather, a modest hand washing may also be a habit that a person has developed before the lack of water and soap.
Promoting handwashing with soap can change the country's decision-making, educate people about the benefits of handwashing and radically change people's lifelong habits.
But this is a good thing, monitoring and monitoring is necessary.
A careful review of 70 cases found that community-based policies in developing countries (LMICs) are effective in encouraging people to wash their hands; however, the practice of washing products is less effective. An example of school-based handwashing is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach"; this approach includes encouraging schools to use simple and inexpensive methods to encourage students to wash their hands with soap, as part of their hygiene requirements.
When the basic standard is achieved, schools can go from one star to three.
Providing hand washing facilities may be one of the key measures to reduce disease and child mortality.
The Global Handwashing Day is also a good example of how to use the campaign to encourage a change in behaviour.Due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has created a campaign online to encourage handwashing.
There are few studies that have examined the financial viability of handwashing in developing countries compared to the DALYs averaged.
However, some studies suggest that the promotion of hand washing and soap outweighs other water and sanitation practices.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for those in a state of emergency such as women in hospital or wounded soldiers, was first emphasized in the mid-19th century by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked at the Vienna Hospital in Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern medicine".
At the time, it was believed that the disease was caused by a fungus called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne illnesses and foodborne diseases caused the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shut down and educate the public on the importance of hand washing to prevent the spread of disease.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2020 led many countries to recognize the importance of hand washing with soap to prevent the aforementioned communicable diseases.
For example, signs with the words "safe hand washing" have been hung for hand washing in public toilets and in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "a person washing his hands" means that a person announces that he has relinquished responsibility or has taken part in a certain activity.
This expression appears in the Bible book of Matthew, where we see Pontius Pilate washing his hands for deciding to crucify Jesus Christ; rather, it is now commonly used in English colonies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs Macbeth is asked to wash her hands while trying to think about the thought, representing the guilt she felt for the crimes she had committed and for delaying her husband.
It has also been found that people are more likely to wash their hands when they remember or recall wrongdoing, and they are more likely to respect hand washing machines than they used to.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after doing so are less likely to avoid repeating the practice of hygiene such as self-medication.
Religions encourage hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which is the use of water without soap to wash hands, is one of the few forms of hand washing practiced in several religions, including Bahai, Hindu, Tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Laotian in Christianity, and Buddhist in Islam.
Hindu, Jewish and Muslim beliefs encourage washing hands after using the toilet.
Also, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims urge washing of hands before and after eating.
Restrictions on workplace disruption caused by COVID-19
The restrictions on workplace exposure due to COVID-19 are the establishment of risk prevention policies and procedures to prevent exposure to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Effective workplace risk prevention methods depend on the location and the workplace and the challenges involved include identifying the source of the risk, the extent of the community disease crisis, the risk of exposure and the individual workers who may be at risk of contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have fewer workplace and workplace interactions, and such risks can be mitigated with minimal first aid, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, breathing habits, and efforts to clean and disinfect the workplace regularly.
Low-risk occupations include those that involve close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 persons, but who may be exposed to the disease through local transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who interact with others, such as schools, workplaces with large crowds, and shopping malls with large crowds.
Such public prevention includes the use of air conditioning, and wearing protective clothing if there is a COVID-19 patient in the vicinity.
OSHA policy is concerned that doctors/nurses working in COVID-19-positive environments are at high risk, and that risk is exacerbated when the staff collects samples from the remains of a person who has died or is suspected of having died of COVID-19.
Prevention measures for these workers include building techniques, such as air-tight enclosures, and appropriate body armor for the job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a wide range of effects on employment.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of contracting the disease.
Businesses can change, both in terms of what people want and how they buy it (e.g. buying at the latest price or wanting to deliver goods or not leaving the stores when they reach the stores).
Finally, the movement of goods from COVID-19 affected areas may be disrupted.Preparation for and prevention of infectious diseases is necessary to help guide prevention efforts.
Plans address the risk factors associated with the workplace and the workplace itself, including the effects of vaccination, risks from home and community, and other risk factors such as age or chronic illness.
They establish the necessary restrictions to deal with the risks, and the necessary precautions to avoid the potential outbreak of disease.
Preparing for infectious diseases may depend on the costs of the whole country or region.
The objectives of controlling emerging diseases include reducing the spread among workers, protecting people at risk of infection from serious harm, continuing operations, and reducing the impact on those with whom businesses interact in the course of their services.
The prevalence of the disease in the business community is a major obstacle to its control.
The problem-solving model is a widely used methodology in the world of work and life problem solving by classifying the methods used according to their benefits.
The COVID-19 pandemic cannot be eliminated, first by effective engineering controls, then by administrative controls and finally by individual measures.
Engineering controls involve the removal of workers from the workforce without regard to work ethic and are the least expensive to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work processes or workflows that require the employee or employer to take action.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be ineffective in preventing or controlling infection but can help in preventing infection.
All PPE types should be selected based on the worker's risk profile, placed where appropriate and safe (e.g. when removed), worn regularly and safely, checked regularly, maintained, returned to normal, removed as needed, repaired, stored or disposed of to avoid infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have few interactions with outside workers.
Basic measures recommended for all workplaces include hand washing and hygiene, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, a practice of chewing or brushing including covering the mouth when scrubbing or picking, providing personal hygiene papers and re-use of personal hygiene papers, preparing for telephone calls or work switches when necessary, encouraging workers not to use other people's equipment, and regular cleaning and disinfection.
Early identification and isolation of suspected cases helps to save the lives of employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with acute respiratory illness stay home until they are cured of malaria, have no symptoms of malaria, and have not used antifreeze for at least 24 hours, and that the leave policies should be flexible, allow workers to stay to care for patients, and that employees should be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, low-risk occupations are those that require people to be within 1.8 m of people who are not known to have or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the business area or because the person has traveled abroad to a known COVID-19 affected area.
This includes workers in contact with other communities such as schools, workplaces, and crowded shops. Engineering controls at these and other high-risk locations include the installation of high-air-conditioning systems in buildings, increasing the size of the classrooms, establishing a minimum number of study rooms such as buses, and establishing a window for shoppers to enter the transportation facilities where workers are sent to work before they leave. During the early stages of the administrative controls, this will be a critical step to encourage people to stay in the workplace, to encourage people to take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection, to use the internet, to provide information on how to protect themselves, to provide information on how to work, to provide information on COVID-19 prevention, to provide information on how to work, and to provide information on how to protect themselves, to provide information on how to work, to provide information on how to work, and to provide information on how to work, to provide information on COVID-19 prevention, and to provide information on how to work, to provide information on how to work, and to protect others.
Workers in this difficult group usually do not need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board an aircraft, effective precautions for crew and passengers include keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, having a staff member take care of the sick person, and giving the sick person a mask or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with a toilet paper.
Aircrew must wear disposable gloves when handling a sick passenger or when touching any bodily fluid or apparently contaminated object, and must wear gloves if the person is apparently feverish, dizzy, or has difficulty breathing.
Disposable gloves and other disposable items should be stored in a biohazard bag, and the disposable items should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.In addition, on cargo ships with passenger compartments, the following risk factors are: prolonged travel if you are ill, isolation and alerting the crew if you experience fever or other symptoms while on board.
The CDC recommends that schools and day care centers temporarily close to clean and disinfect the area if an infected person is in the school building and if the area has not been infected.
In the event of an outbreak of a contagious disease in the community, isolation measures may be used, such as cancelling tours, queuing at schools, and other large gatherings such as holding exercise or social groups or eating together in the school hall, increasing seating capacity for students, adjusting the arrival and return times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a special health office for children with symptoms similar to those of epilepsy.
If there is a high prevalence of the disease in the community, it is advisable to extend the period of school closures to avoid social distancing.For freelancers who are engaged in routine activities, the risk of infection is considered to be very low by the CDC.
Security guards who have been in contact with people who have been confirmed to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the same procedures as emergency medical services, including the use of full body massages.
If contact occurs when a person is infected, staff should clean and disinfect their clothes before reusing them with household air fresheners or sprayers, and follow generally accepted procedures for cleaning the bathroom and washing clothes.
OSHA considers some healthcare workers and warehouse workers to be at a very high risk of contracting the disease.
The most dangerous occupations include home care, support, testing, and healthcare workers who are in close contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These are at increased risk when staff engage in aerosol-generating procedures on patients or when they handle samples from people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Aerosol-generating procedures include aerosol-based scanning, bronchoscopy, dental procedures, or invasive specimen collection.
High-risk procedures for the dead include preparing the bodies of people who were known to be sick or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of death; these are at high risk when they are examined for the dead body.Engineering controls for these high-risk groups include the use of isolation rooms for patients known to be sick or suspected of having COVID-19, including aerosol-generating procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation systems may be useful in certain medical conditions and in the treatment of cadavers.
Samples taken from humans should be handled with the utmost care (Biosafety Level 3 precautions).
WHO recommends that new patients be isolated and placed in special waiting areas if they are suspected of having COVID-19.In addition to other PPE procedures, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working within 6 feet of SARS-CoV-2 patients or suspected patients and those working on aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 masks or higher must be used under strictly regulated conditions including pre-testing, user training, training, and clinical evaluation.
Other types of vaccines can be more effective in keeping workers engaged.WHO does not recommend the use of vaccines because COVID-19 is a viral disease and is not transmitted through the body's own urine.
WHO has approved the use of the surgical cannabis for the diagnosis of patients.
For those who collect human blood samples, care for, or transport COVID-19 patients without using aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of a cosmetic mask, glasses or face mask, and gloves.
When an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
As PPE is not sufficient, WHO recommends limiting the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in telemedicine, using light-emitting dials such as illuminated windows, allowing only direct medical personnel to enter the room with COVID-19 patients, using only the appropriate personal protective equipment, using a specialised form of self-care for patients with a specific disease, monitoring and coordinating the spread of detectable cancer, and not allowing the use of such equipment in patients without symptoms.

COVID-19: reducing workload and preparing for the future
The date and time of the event is March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved by the publisher
We are in a difficult situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that all people in the world are connected and live together and each has responsibilities towards the other.
We have no precedent for this challenge, but we know that our response depends on the global empathy, solidarity, and social cooperation that this institution is built upon.
The kindness and care we have seen among our colleagues through e-mail, phone calls, and phone chats clearly shows that we are a sympathetic and privileged society.
I cannot thank my friends enough.
Last week, someone thanked me for the work we do.
It reminded me of the importance of the world running on Wikipedia at this time, that this is also a strong sign that Wikipedia is so valuable and should be on the web for everyone to use.
Your work has helped us achieve this, by helping to create a website, by helping to pay our staff or people to live in a safe environment.
At this time, the world needs Wikipedia information more than ever.
It is now time to see how our actions and our ways affect the world.
Because of the importance of this commitment and your work on this matter, we will be making some adjustments to our practice starting next week.
Changing our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the committee met last night to discuss our process and our schedule for the coming days and months.
In our conversation, we discussed what we think is the best way to prepare for the challenges we face and the best way to keep the department running at the moment.
We both wanted to break free from the pressure and support our cause for a while.
If you want to hit again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and temporary workers:
we expect to work 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until we can change that again.
We have not announced a holiday  If you can work more than these hours, the department can employ you.
Yet, the world is unpredictable now and whether you want to care for loved ones, buy household appliances, or go to the hospital, your life is the most important thing to us.
We will not monitor your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
We should not discuss this, but we have seen fit to do so.
No sick days or unemployment benefits are required. Please inform your manager and help your colleagues to adjust the work schedule to ensure that all schedules are met.
(If you are tested positive for COVID-19, inform Bryan at T&amp;C Ops know so T&amp;C will provide you with the necessary support and will try to ensure that you are well and receive the necessary support from our management).
Those who work hourly will be paid in full.
We have already said, and here we reiterate, that we will honor our commitments to our contractors and hourly workers.
Each person will be paid according to his or her normal hours under normal circumstances.
This is a job to look after when you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use social media to get rid of the pressure from the people/things around them.
Especially at times like these is our activity rewarding and satisfying.
I repeat here that it is up to you to take care of yourself.
We simply ask that you discuss with your employer what to expect and make adjustments as needed.
Some jobs are considered very important.
There are things that do not have to stay put.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Wellbeing, and recruitment teams (etc.) perform a variety of tasks that require additional support.
We will begin the campaign of identifying our goals now and set our focus now to support the priorities of our actions.
We have a lot to do, we just need to focus on the most important projects.
A shortening of the race will not affect our outcome.
We do not plan to overtime by compensating for the loss of a job.
Do not expect to work overtime because of unrealistic work schedules.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will set new goals and adjust to where we need to be.
What will be done with the Annual Planning?
To shift to a more sustainable lifestyle, we expect to see a shift in the number of days we work, and we hope to see a shift in the number of days we work, in line with the goals of our 2020-2021 Year Plan.
Our aim is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to give us more time to work on the budget so that the workers can prioritize the main agricultural sectors, take care of themselves, take care of their people and take care of those who want to work part time in the next few weeks.
This increase reduces the workload and the workload to complete the current workload in any department.
We will present our proposals to the Governing Body next week and inform the members and others of the necessary amendments once we have confirmed them.
Thank you all my friends for the planning and leadership in all matters.
Office conditions, installation and cleaning
Last week we were informed that one of our colleagues in San Francisco has apparently been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
Instead, with great caution, we got disinfected and sprayed the entire space and equipment in the San Francisco office.
They used pesticides to disinfect everything, from the elevator poles that reached the ceiling of our offices to the floorboards.
The owners of the building also used their own methods to care for their employees.
We feel at ease that the office will be well organized when we decide to return to work.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, and the center has shown us its COVID-19 response plan and all staff members have taken part in the program.
By the end of last week, our DC office was relocated to a more remote location following the inspiration of San Francisco.
And as some of my NYC friends know, we've been dating and rented a place in Brooklyn.
This dating is still going on but it can be attacked.
Some of our colleagues are working from home for the first time.
Some of our longtime friends know that it is challenging, and they would like to offer some suggestions:
Keep the package for one to two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider alternate dates for such meetings.
At each meeting, prepare the material, and send in the required material in advance.
The video you are uploading using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to help with the interaction.
Have someone chair each meeting, someone monitor the questions and time allocated and someone monitor the speakers and someone deliver the presentations (or everyone agree and take action).
If you need earphones, email the technicians to get you a good earphone.
Use the money returned to you to be in good shape.
Join the #remoties social networking site in Slack and talk to your friends about tasks
The Department of Labour is looking into the issue of webinar-based ergonomics guidance to assist with the tasks assigned to the entire Department.
In the past week, we have asked the funders to cancel all Wikimedia events such as editathons, until the WHO announces that the recovery is complete.
We explained that we fully understand that requesting cancellations and restrictions would make it difficult to carry out certain scheduled activities and that no one would be penalized for delaying completion or changing scheduled activities.
Over the next week, we will be following up on more inspiration on Wikimania and the webinar and those from other places.
What we see most among our colleagues around the world is that our colleagues are saddened by such cancellations but they are also dismayed when they realize that they have to focus on their community, Wikimedia etc.
In the future, CRT is working to create a Meta-Wiki database to give people time to track their impact and follow our communications.
Keep in touch on COVID-19 issues
We will invite you through your calendars for a special meeting next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to discuss other matters, answer your questions, and have a little chat.
This is a matter for all of us, and we should all help one another in every way possible.
While there, you can find this information on email and other COVID-19-related websites, and on Office Wiki.
The CRT will endeavour to collect the latest information needed in one place.
We are also working to establish regular contacts with staff in the countries most affected at the moment.
If you have any questions about travel, events, any work or challenge to accomplish your tasks, or anything else you need help with, please feel free to let us know and contact CRT.
We are ready to help and contact you on any matter.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
All these changes should not be seen as taking away our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they help us to appreciate that now, our duties and responsibilities may need to change in a different way than in the past.
These principles we believe are necessary to support each other in order to continue our work, to support our organization in any way necessary, and to serve the people and the ministry on which they depend.
The activities we have planned will be carried out in due time.
It is appropriate now to help one another and to set aside time for important activities in the weeks and even months ahead.
We all need to make this happen, so we all need to take care of ourselves and our families so that we can be in a better place when we need it.
Now, others  wash your hands and not your face!
The following are the names of the three directors: Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other directors (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protein that binds to the surface (cell membrane) of the immune system in the kidneys, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 is a potent antagonist of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II by increasing Ang ((1-7)), making it a potential drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a precursor to immunity in some coronaviruses.
In humans this compound is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of blood cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein is a member of the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 passes through the peripheral skin once, with its major components appearing on the surface of the gums and other tissues.
The surface of ACE2 is absorbed by the skin and transported by a chemical known as sheddase, which then transfers the protein hydrolysis to the bloodstream and then into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most tissues: ACE2 binds to the cell membrane, particularly the type II membrane of the kidney, the small intestine, the blood vessels and the lymph nodes, and the lymph nodes of the kidneys in most tissues.
The ACE2 mRNA is also found in the brain's membrane, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to regulate ACE
ACE binds to the angiotensin I hormone in the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 then binds to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and is secreted into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind to a variety of proteins including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the cell cycle of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is suspected to cause Hartnup syndrome.
As a cell-mediated protein, ACE2 acts as a key gateway to immunity to some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the spike S1 protein binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the key ACE2 molecule on the surface of the host cell causes the virus and the host cell to move from their original site to the host cell.
This entry process also requires the synthesis of the S protein and the serine protease TMPRSS2, the transcription of which is under investigation to see if it can be used in clinical trials.This has led some to speculate that by reducing the amount of ACE2 in cells, it may help fight infection.
Instead, various medical and regulatory agencies advocate the continuation of the well-known ACE inhibitor alongside ARB therapy.
A careful review of the results of a clinical trial published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was up to 34 percent less likely to cause diarrhea than other prescribed drugs.
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at risk of developing pneumonia, especially those with seizures and heart disease.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been thought to reduce malaria mortality, although the results were not as dramatic as the risks posed by malaria"
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be the most advanced treatment for severe lung damage, and has been shown to improve neural adhesion and respiratory movement in young rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The decrease of rhACE2 in humans takes 10 hours and the onset of activity in 30 minutes with a 24-hour duration of activity.
Findings from various studies suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those who are not resistant to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where angiotensin II circulation is enhanced.Infused rhACE2 is being studied in clinical trials in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help track contacts in the fight against the 2019-20 coronavirus, i.e. the process of identifying people (in contact with the patient) who may have come into contact with an infected person.
Various apps have been developed or approved, with official government support in various regions and territories.
Various methods of building apps that track contacts with patients have been developed.
The issues we discussed above, especially the ones based on tracking the location of the users of the app.
Other low-cost methods include using Bluetooth waves to connect the user's phone to other nearby phones
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would collaborate to support Bluetooth-like apps on Android and iOS directly in their respective mobile devices.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipau, has launched an app that allows its citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, the TraceTogether app is already used.
The app was developed by local IT teams, developed as a free-to-use app and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth app to track participants and suspected cases and quickly send messages to healthcare providers and authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is yet to be confirmed by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the patient contact tracing app was in the final stages of development, and would be available in a few weeks.A similar app is being developed in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia is planning to launch a geofencing app for COVID-19 positive patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists the potential risks of app-based solutions, including the perceived success and potential failure of the app if it is used by the public.
To address the issue of rogue or malicious coronavirus apps, Apple has placed restrictions on which types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their App Store, allowing only those from identified organizations or organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Campaigners expressed concern about the potential impact of mass surveillance of coronavirus apps, especially whether surveillance built to address the primary concerns will be addressed once the pandemic is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a petition calling for restrictions on this type of tracking.
The agencies announced eight restrictions on government projects:
supervision should be legal, necessary and proportionate;
the follow-up and follow-up shall include a notice of the end date;
The information will be used only for COVID-19 related information.
to protect the father from being exposed must be preserved and this confirmed by the testimony
computer monitoring should avoid further raising issues of discrimination and discrimination;
sharing information with others must be legally defined;
there should be mechanisms to prevent human rights violations and the right of citizens to defend themselves against discrimination;
"participatory transparency" of all "stakeholders" will be required, including social workers and groups of affected individuals. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also developed a follow-up.
The Google/Apple agreement aims to resolve the issue of endless monitoring by removing the monitoring system from their devices when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries used mobile phone tracking instead of app tracking, preventing app downloads and even the ability to avoid being tracked.
In Israel, telephone surveillance was allowed.
Mobile phone tracking systems that provide precise location information are highly vulnerable to privacy concerns.
However, not all servers need to be shared to have a shared location; several privacy policies are in place for shared servers used for internal communication.
In South Korea, a non-app-based vaccine was used to track contacts with infected people
Instead of using a standalone app, the device collected data from various sources including tracking phone messages and user-generated card data, which was combined to record messages and sent to the phones of people who were likely to be infected.
In addition to using this information to alert people who may have had contact with the patients, government and local information is publicly available, which was allowed due to changes in the law that were introduced after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through various apps and websites. Countries in Germany have considered using a common approach to privacy.
As of 6 April 2020, the blueprints had not yet been released.
Contact tracing is a well-established practice, with several studies conducted since the beginning of 2013.On 7 April 2020, several expert groups worked on improving the security systems, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to track the user's location based on other phones.
Of course, PEPP-PT is a collaborative system that has both common and differentiated protocols, and does not follow the same set of rules.The separate protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) etc.
Under these laws, the resuscitation information is not removed from the device, and all contact is made there.
The MIT Media Lab's Twekisize team has developed SafePaths, a methodology that uses anonymity in research and the use of a data-sharing platform to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the report "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020.
SafeTrace builds a secure technology to enable users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and administrators, without compromising any privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Coalition was formed by a consortium of groups using a common approach and consistent rules, with the goal of reducing the number of groups, and to be able to coordinate the development of tracking and messaging apps, a key factor in enabling more people to share.

release of a policy to enable the government to develop official apps that track the coronavirus but keep it confidential.
Directly integrate this feature into iOS and Android Google and Apple systems to resolve the issue of authorization and endless monitoring of the sharing of the product by activating the active component, and then later removing it once the threat is resolved.
Drug repositioning (also called drug reuse, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the reuse of an approved drug to treat a different disease or physical condition from that originally intended.
This is one of the most scientifically followed studies currently underway to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other follow-up studies include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has 66 drug-binding proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
The study of these binding sites helps in the development of vaccines against COVID-19 proteins.
The main proteins that SARS-CoV-2 targets are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.

The COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine for the 2019 pandemic (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has survived clinical trials, there have been several attempts to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, WHO said it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be available on the market in less than 18 months.
The five-stage vaccine was in Phase I trials to assess the risks in April.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
The coronavirus pandemic swept the world in 2020, prompting massive investments in research and development of vaccines.
Many organizations are using the newly released genomes to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
The study began on Thursday, and the requirements for CEPI's vaccine development efforts are speed, manufacturing capacity, production of the required quantity and worldwide distribution.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were in the research and development phase as of early 2020 to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.
The key elements of the Phase I risk assessment include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Developer of Phase I and precursor of the vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Developer of the Phase I and target drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in May, 115 target vaccines were in the early stages of development, 78 of which were approved as ongoing projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more announced, but with insufficient data to be made public (presumably in the planning or distribution stages).
Phase I-II trials involve the initial risk assessment and vaccination testing, follow-up, and multi-site treatment of the flu vaccine, as well as the most effective dosage.
Phase III trials involve multiple participants and a comparative study to see how the drug works against the disease, as it monitors the effects of higher doses.

In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities purchased software to acquire classroom computing from IBM, in addition to cloud computing services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a variety of side effects, known as unknown side effects.
That means it can be more effective than just preventing disease.
Another emergency trial in Australia is aiming to enroll 4,170 nurses.
Currently developed vaccines may be either harmless or ineffective.
Initial studies to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines using selected animals with COVID-19, such as ACE2-added worms, other experimental animals, and other animals, suggest the need for biosafety-level 3 biosecurity measures, and global collaboration to ensure safe production.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animals.
As of 2020, no cure or vaccine for SARS has been found to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the development of new vaccines and treatments for SARS was a privilege for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS became widespread, it was thought that the current research on SARS could provide valuable insights that could be used to develop a vaccine and treatment for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, only one vaccine (DNA-based) had passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others were in development, all together known as viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
There are rumors circulating on social media that the virus COVID-19 was already known and that a vaccine was already developed.
The discovery reported by various media outlets refers to the recent developments in the development of vaccines to treat and prevent other coronavirus infections such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include malaria, nausea, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include a fracture, a sore throat, runny nose, diarrhea, difficulty in breathing, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most patients experience mild symptoms, some develop a severe case of pneumonia and organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, with 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is most commonly spread through close contact, especially through a person's mouth, mouth, or mouth.
Yes, a fountain is a breathing spring, usually falling on the ground or on objects, and not reaching people over long distances.
People can also contract the disease by touching infected areas, such as their face, nose, or lips.
The virus can survive on a surface for 72 hours.
It is usually given within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it may occur before symptoms are apparent and in later stages of the disease.The most commonly used technique is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) by extracting a sample of urine.
It is recommended to use masks on those who suspect the virus and those who care for them.
The use of masks is generally accepted, while some authorities prohibit, some recommend and others mandate their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antibody for COVID-19.
Internal transmission of the disease has been observed in several countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected may not notice symptoms or experience the flu-like symptoms of malaria, diarrhea, diarrhea, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pain or tightness, dizziness, difficulty moving and touching the face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms persist.
Rare symptoms include, upper upper symptoms of the upper jaw such as sneezing, runny nose or runny nose.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea and diarrhea have been observed in varying degrees.
At first, some patients in China first feel pressure in the chest and the muscles beat.
In some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the birth cycle.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually between five and six days but can be longer and can be between two and 14 days.
97.5% of cases develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all cases develop symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of disease is not yet fully understood; however, early data suggest that they may transmit disease.
The prevalence of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown and is under investigation, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases were asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began counting the number of asymptomatic cases among daily patients on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.
The skin and mucous membranes can be highly toxic.
Shouting is more likely to cause a person to go out of his way than is normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that a person who coughed without covering his lips would be forced to jump out of a well 4.5 meters (15 feet) high.
Although the virus is not generally spread through the air, the National Academy of Sciences says that bioaerosol transmission is possible and that airborne samples of RNA have been detected in human households.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may contain radioactive contaminants that are released into the air and thus result in airborne infections.
Although there is a fear that the disease may be spread through the bite, the risk is thought to be low.The virus is most likely to infect when patients show symptoms; although the bite may cause symptoms to be subtle, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although the spread of disease is slow, on average one person infects two to three others. The virus remains on the surface for between an hour and days.
In particular, the virus has been found to be resistant to exposure after one day on a canvas, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and non-toxic materials (AISI 304), and four hours on 99% copper-containing materials.
Rather, this time varies according to the source and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used properly; soap products remove protective skin, relax and remove any scratches and debris.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a disinfectant used in human diets), are not effective.In a study in Hong Kong, skin samples were taken from people within about two days of being admitted to bed.
Of the six patients, the first sample showed high levels of the virus and the sixth patient showed high levels of the virus on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first identified in three patients with pneumonia as a reaction to the severe respiratory syndrome virus seen in patients in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in all viruses that are resistant to the coronavirus in the genome.
When the virus is outside the body in contact with soap, the soap is toxic to the outside environment. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
The lungs are the most vulnerable to COVID-19 as the virus enters the intestinal tract via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is predominantly found in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special glycoprotein membrane called a "thorn" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the target cell.
Severe heart failure was found in 12% of patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is common in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high, due to systemic inflammatory response and problems in the myocardial system during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac activity.
a risk of blood clots (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been reported in COVID-19 patients requiring specialized treatment and may be a contradiction to the hypothesis.Examination of the cadavers of COVID-19 patients has revealed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and a low level of plasma in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is mediated by ACE2-induced epithelial cell death, patients with COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have been observed in the analysis of cadavers.
WHO publishes a protocol for the investigation of many diseases.
The most common test is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on samples taken from the urine and obtained with a urinary swab; however, a nasal swab or a cheek swab may also be used.
Results are usually obtained within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be used but the samples must be taken from two people in two weeks apart and the results are not usually immediate.
Chinese scientists have detected the coronavirus and released the genetic sequence of the virus, which has led to the world-wide testing of the virus, including the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.
As of 4 April 2020, immunoassay (which can detect a physical infection or previous infection) was in development, but had not yet been widely used.
Testing experience in China has shown that the accuracy of the test is only between 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States passed a first-point-of-care test for use on 21 March 2020 at the end of the month.The results of the test published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University included the development of a vaccine based on the symptoms and risk factors of the disease.Features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
These may occur as the disease progresses Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation.
Information on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19 is limited.
Key findings of the autopsy were:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the lungs and pulmonary edema
Four aggressive types of bacterial pneumonia can be identified:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD has caused severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
treatment of pneumonia: or systemic effects of pneumonia and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining a clean airway and avoiding touching the face, nose or mouth before hand washing.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose whenever you sneeze or urinate and recommends hand-washing when you lift or sneeze when you are not wearing a mask.
Proper hand washing after hand-washing or hand-washing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public, one of the goals of which is to prevent transmission of infection, especially to patients with symptoms.The distancing measures are intended to reduce contact between infected people and large groups of people when schools and workplaces are closed, restrict movement and cancel large gatherings.
The rules are based on distance and include a minimum of 6 feet (1.8 m) of bowing.
There is no known cure for COVID-19.The target time for rapid vaccine availability is 2021, and the strategy to combat COVID-19 is to try to slow the spread of the disease, which is known as "pre-implantation".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are clearly stained, before eating and after coughing, sneezing or sneezing.
The agency also recommends using a sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when at least soap and water are not available.In areas where sanitizers are not available, the WHO recommends two options for the manufacture of the product.
In this process, the active ingredient is alcohol (ethanol) or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "a hand antiseptic".
Glycerol is added to the well solution (humectant.
People are treated with a surgical procedure, which may include water, oxygen, and surgical treatment of the affected organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they have the virus wear a mask.
Extrakorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure but the benefits of this procedure are still being investigated.
Personal hygiene and health care and nutritious diet are recommended to enhance the human body.
Supplemental therapy can help those with mild symptoms as soon as they become infected.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the treatment of people who have been vaccinated for COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the United States have written recommendations from various departments and put them in the free document, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no treatment for COVID-19 has been developed.
In treating symptoms, some experts recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen as the primary treatment.
Care should be taken to reduce the risk of infection, especially in hospitals where a patient is being treated with a fluid-inducing procedure such as intubation or hand-held ventilation.
For health care providers treating patients with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the individual be air-conditioned (AIIR) despite the use of routine precautions, contact and ventilation precautions.The CDC recommends the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the recovery period.
The most commonly used masks are: eye drops, eye drops, eye drops, eye masks, and eyelashes.
N95 masks are approved for industrial use but the FDA has authorized emergency use (EUA) masks.
They are designed to protect the person from airborne particles such as dust, but the best protection against germs is not guaranteed by improper use.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends that homemade masks be used if there is no other option.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not too severe to require vaccination but there is a need for vaccination.
The type of respiratory support required for people with COVID-19 respiratory problems is being studied particularly in hospitalized patients, and there is evidence that nasal implantation may be avoided by using high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether any of these have the same effect on patients who are severely ill.
Some doctors prefer invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this method reduces the emission of particulate matter compared to high flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds for patients in relation to their population, which limits the capacity of hospitals to serve patients in the event of a COVID-19 pandemic and the need for hospitalisation.
A study in China found that 5% were hospitalized, 2.3% needed ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 patients in hospitals are eventually admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
Mechanical ventilation is further complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 and the increasing difficulty of breathing.
Ventilators that can operate with high PEEP are needed to provide adequate oxygen while reducing the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older refrigerators.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently being tested.
Remdesivir is the one that seems to offer hope.
While the development of a new drug may be delayed until 2021, other clinical trials have already been approved for use in other diseases and are now at an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral medication may be tested on people with serious illnesses.
WHO has recommended volunteers to participate in clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety of the drug.The FDA has granted temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as a temporary treatment in situations where human life is at risk.
It is not yet available for clinical trials to determine if it is safe and to determine if it is a cure for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to help monitor the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can 'track' you using tracking data, thus helping to detect the risk of infection.
Each user can check the status of the other three users.
When a potential threat is identified, the app not only recommends quarantine, but also threatens local health authorities.Big data analytics on mobile phone data, eye-blind technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected individuals and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed agencies to monitor the mobile phone records of people suspected of having coronavirus.
This was done to strengthen the self-quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with the infected.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared location data with the government's Robert Koch Institute for Research and Prevention.
Russia developed technology to blindly track those fleeing the quarantine.
The official of the Italian Ministry of Health, Giulio Gallera, said that he was told by mobile phones that "40% of the population is still mobile".
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Similarly, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has called on the world to develop new ways to fight the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel self-loathing because of quarantines, travel restrictions, medical issues, or fear of infectious diseases.
Rory O'Connor was quoted by the BBC as saying, "The increasing isolation, loneliness, isolation, stress and economic isolation are all factors that are disrupting the mind and the quality of life".
The illness may be mild and show few or no symptoms, similar to other illnesses that often affect the upper extremities such as the common cold.
Mild illnesses usually resolve within about two weeks, while severe or severe illnesses can take between three and six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data on COVID-19 on this subject are not yet available.
For those who are severely affected, COVID-19 can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Common infections of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, kidney and liver failure.
Blood clots, especially increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, while kidney problems were observed in 4% of patients in the same group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes, transaminases.
According to the same report, the average delay from onset of symptoms to death was ten days, with ten days spent in hospital beds.
Instead, patients in intensive care units (ICUs) had a time scale between seven days in hospital and death.
In the early-stage study, the average time to death for a person with symptoms ranged from 14 days to 6 to 41 days.
In the National Health Commission (NHC) survey in China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for men.
Histological examinations of the dead samples indicate the presence of diffuse alveolar damage and cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac arrest was associated with troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations were due to other medical conditions.Related health care and economic factors may also increase the death rate.
Estimates of mortality vary because of regional variation, but also because of the difficulty of transportation.
Counting those who are not seriously ill can lead to higher death rates.
Rather, the fact that the deaths are those of the recently infected may mean that the death toll is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and 2.4 times more likely to require emergency treatment or die compared to nonsmokers.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a decrease in liver capacity of between 20% and 30% in some cases and pulmonary scans showed that it was affected.
This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether other infections were effective in treating patients who recovered from the disease.
The mutation is apparent, based on the behaviour of other coronavirus, but patients who recovered from COVID-19 later tested positive for the coronavirus.
It is thought that such patients are infected with a different disease and not re-infected.
The virus is thought to be a natural and originated from animals and was accidentally transmitted to humans (spillover infection).
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the disease was concentrated in the circulation of people.
A study of 41 first confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, showed that the first symptoms appeared on 1 December 2019.
Official documents from WHO stated that the first case of symptoms occurred on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region and depend on the number of tests, the quality of treatment, the available treatment, the time since the disease has developed and other factors such as age, which is a factor in the overall health of the population.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 to those who died of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in a test and U07.2 to those who died from COVID-19 without testing in a test to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2.
According to data from John Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), a figure that indicates the percentage of those who have tested positive and died from the disease, and the infection rate (IFR), a figure that indicates the number of people who have tested positive (and then tested positive and died) from a particular disease.
These statistics are not based on time and follow individuals of a particular type from the time of diagnosis to the end of their lives (recovered or deceased).
While not all people who are infected receive immune cells, a person's immune system can provide information on the number of people who are infected.
In Italy, where the disease was most prevalent, the small village of Castiglione d'Adda, 4,600 people died, 80 (1.7 percent).
In Gangelt, the disease spread during the Carnival festival celebrations, where it affected young people, with few deaths and not all deaths from COVID-19 were classified as fatal.
Also, hospitals in Germany will not be burdened by patients.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has an immune system, as observed in blood donors.
69 (~0.004%) people have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The incidence of infection and the rate of death differ for men and women.
The majority of deaths are among men, according to studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men in their 50s, with a male-female gap of 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may play a role.
Differences in sex based on age, women's lower smoking rates and men's shorter life expectancy for various diseases such as epilepsy than women's may have contributed to higher male mortality rates.
In Europe, 57% of cases were male and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the US government was not tracking gender information in COVID-19 cases.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most of the nurses, especially the native, are women, meaning that they are more likely to be infected.
WHO announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the disease was first detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to any particular place (e.g. China), species or group of people, followed by international references to avoid discrimination.The virus that causes COVID-19 is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus identity" in their public communications.
Both, the virus is often referred to as "coronavirus".
When it first emerged in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO approved 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as temporary names for viral infections following the 2015 guidelines to prohibit the use of sites to contain infections and viruses.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited capacity to produce standard products, some manufacturers produce health products such as nasal swabs and respiratory devices.
In one example, when a hospital in Italy needed ventilators, but the manufacturer delayed supplying them, a local factory devised and produced 100 ventilators per night.
After the COVID-19 outbreak, first, conspiracy theories, false news stories about the origin, extent, prevention and treatment of the disease and other information about the disease began to circulate and spread all over the Internet in a matter of seconds.
Humans seem to be able to infect animals.
Studies have failed to find data on the spread of the virus in pigs, cats, and chickens.
There is no proven cure or vaccine for this disease.
Global research on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines is being conducted by various government agencies, research organizations, and laboratory researchers.
In March, WHO launched a "TESTING PREVISION" system to evaluate the most effective existing vaccines.
There is no cure but several agencies are working to find one that will work.
Preliminary studies of SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter the human immune system.
There are three types of vaccines being studied.
First, researchers are aiming to develop a vaccine that is different from the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether alive or dead, aims to create a new immune response to the new disease including COVID-19.
Another method, called subunit vaccines, is a method that aims to create a vaccine that causes the immune system to block the virus when it attacks the body.
For SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus to bind to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third type is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
The vaccine being tested from these systems will require testing for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial began with four volunteer trials in Seattle.
A vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.The development of the immune system has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is misleading.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 clinical trials underway.
Seven trials were conducted to evaluate drugs already approved for the treatment of malaria, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The vaccine used to treat other diseases is the largest component of the Chinese trial, with nine phase III trials of remdesivir across several countries due to be released in late April.
A major clinical trial of the development of a potential COVID-19 vaccine and drug was conducted in April 2020.A number of common antibiotics are being studied to treat COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there was unconfirmed information that remdesivir, a potential treatment.
There was an increase in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which is used to treat malaria, was tested in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
Rather, there are requests for a peer review of the research.
Health officials in Korea and China support the use of chloroquine.
However, despite the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which advocates ingesting one dose per day of less than one gram, warns that overdosing is dangerous and can kill you.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency order approving the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the recommendations of doctors treating COVID-19 patients.The 7 recommendations were implemented by the Chinese and include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in the treatment of COVID-19.
The results suggest that higher doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been supported for further study in biological organisms after it demonstrated weakness in the initiation of SARS-CoV-2.The findings suggest that initial spike protein priming of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is effective in inducing SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor.
Cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies with or without azithromycin have several drawbacks that have prevented clinicians from approving the use of these treatments without further investigation.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and efficacy is unknown for COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a serious disorder when COVID-19 is present.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.Tocilizumab has been approved by the Chinese National Health Commission for clinical use after a limited trial.
It is in phase 2 of a nationwide pre-clinical trial in Italy after showing symptoms in the population.
It is now being combined with serum ferritin blood tests to detect cytokine storms, and is aiming to release similar substances, which are thought to kill some patients.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on previous studies to treat steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by a different agent, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no conclusive evidence that tocilizumab treats or cures CRS.
Transplanting immunocompromised and immunocompromised vaccinated individuals from COVID-19 patients into the target population is considered a prevention strategy if the individual is not vaccinated.
This method was tested on SARS but the results were inconclusive.
Antibiotics are a form of antibiotic therapy that is specifically targeted against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Alternative methods of treating indirect immune response, such as the use of monoclonal immune response, are under development.
Convalescent serum, which contains blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies to the virus, can be added to supplement the drug.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of similar symptoms
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, later contracted COVID-19 and died after announcing the virus.
