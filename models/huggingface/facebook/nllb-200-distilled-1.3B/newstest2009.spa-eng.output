The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the morning's rapid fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions in ČEZ shares reached approximately half their value on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, early on Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday's fall as it fell about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in stock prices on Wall Street.
Here too the market reaction to the result of the vote in the US House of Representatives that refused to support the financial secretary's stabilization plan is expressed.
The fall in stocks in Asia
Asian stock markets fell dramatically on Tuesday, though the index eventually eased some of the losses.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong was down nearly 4 percent during the day, but later eased its losses by cutting the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that tracks movements in Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but in the end, the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Index Secretary fell 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions scheduled in the US are insecure and this influences the financial market around the world", said Hong Kong's Chief Currency Officer Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, i.e. it is independent of the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are on par with those in the United States.
American lawmakers should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and pass a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens to make the falls felt in other countries.
Bloodbath of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a financial bailout plan that would have cost $700 billion.
The lawmakers, in that way, ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks went into a bloody bath and mainly the stock index took its biggest drop in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to almost 7 percent, a similar drop in volume last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal was not going ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress retires: the U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
US lawmakers caused a gap in talks over the approval of the bailout plan in its form of aid to the US financial system in the amount of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, he is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the bill and have it voted on.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Financial Services and Banking, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the ratification of the bailout plan should mark the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The plan must be effective.
"We have made great progress.
We resolved our divergent views on how the package of measures for market stabilization should be structured", said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the proposal.
Representatives of the legislators met Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive shape to the government's fund.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets that drive financial corporations into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already at it", said Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is having a direct impact on the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything possible to get Congress to finally approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' business in the Asian financial market, as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence the trade on Monday.
However, for now, nothing is certain about when the two houses of the US Congress will vote and even if they will not get stuck at the last minute with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be passed in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, which would be another $100 billion and later the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can override his veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities whose value had fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be ready to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the talks.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and that he valued "both sides' efforts to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the protected contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on the liability of the taxpayer's money from the program to protect taxpayers from their losses, a relieving shutdown of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called "armoured contracts" for directors of participating companies and create a committee to oversee the fund.
This one would have to be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also aims to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to new mortgage payments to buy in order to lower the monthly installment payments burden on borrowers and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government", Marek said this week, for the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"Much more important is that, already this week, congressmen agree to support him and give him their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is, at this time, the most important", Marek insisted.
Armed struggle: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear to me that it's better to buy only the phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the reproductive organ.
The choice depends largely on the way it is used and the requirements of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for me to get the most modern turntables to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on.
Moreover, this type of music products such as LP records are no longer being sold, and as far as their quality is concerned there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If you have a lot of vinyl records of art rock, jazz, and blues on your shelves, you are probably dreaming of at least one of these.
This is the same with music that's coming, which is compressed music, simplified music -- music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as it is for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the 20 crown market helmets.
Two extremes, between which there's enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines battery life.
Some of the best players do much more than just play music and even that which even most cell phones cannot.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to basic functions like calling, texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and even navigate.
And when you take into consideration the smartphone and the PDA, you're going to have a small computer in your pocket, too.
This is a small miracle since no fridge can make a grill and no television can take pictures.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the earlier the indicator on the screen lights up asking to be recharged.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy drains.
Few cell phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simpler ones) clearly have a higher performance.
So keep in mind that cheap phones won't play for more than two hours.
If, on top of this, they constantly call get still, for more safety, a charger for work - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have, because even the worst ones can last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem happens when recording music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly onto the memory card but only on some un-reduced readers can the small memory cards used in mobile phones be connected.
In the case of players, with some exceptions (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library based on the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only display a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
The choice of equipment depends on the battery's strength, memory capacity, sound output quality and type and, of course, the comfort of use.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you listen to it every day for just a little while, like on the tram, then you can just have any mobile phone that plays it.
Which is practically what any mobile phone can do.
You should not even care about the format in which the mobile phone or the player plays the music.
MP3 is played by everyone and, practically, almost all music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the company Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough to visit the relevant websites of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service alone could be a strong argument for purchasing a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is miserable and most are limited only to the issues of fleeting radio success.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that this very way of selling music (whether via GSM, the internet or the wireless internet) will in the future dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone with them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you'll find your cell phone in your pocket, while your MP3 player will be left at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree ones.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile phone even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the music-enabled phones is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three grand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone jack.
The best ones, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for a classic headset, cost up to 15,000.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing less than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to previous ordinary cassettes or also to the turntables is obvious.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that we accidentally connect to the Internet with our mobile phone and, consequently, a huge data download bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for changing the memory card (M2 type, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card it will reach two thousand crowns.
Be careful, though.
Basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive ones have 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a cell phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, check out Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), no more than 1.100 kroner is required.
If you are considered one of the most demanding music lovers, use the most specialized mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of a single player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman line phones have almost identical use as an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned more arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will be coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all the services of their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It'll probably be here soon.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the whole Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of roaming charges are likely to lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared with Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has already said that there is no longer room in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a conventional operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market led to a significant price decline, which also affected traditional operators.
At the same time, even before the arrival of sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the British market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It showed that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, there is no need to look too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from this, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not entail relatively large costs in building, operating and maintaining the network.
In the world these types of virtual operators are usually characterized by low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages which, however, are often counterbalanced by the offer of more tailored services.
For example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a not-so-trivial target group can also be a good hit.
This operator is specifically targeting the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it's the operator he likes and can trust", says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a concept like that of Poland could catch on in our country.
The Commission notes that the Czech Republic has not provided any evidence that the measure was necessary to achieve the objective of common interest.
In addition, from the point of view of the supply of services, it is relatively saturated.
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too promising.
Rather it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region", Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, told mobil.cz in a telephone conversation.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible to prevent any potential competition from arising.
Interest in launching a virtual mobile operator is already being shown by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take a step forward to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of enterprise customers.
"We are very interested in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telephony services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators with this possibility.
With some of them we have managed to move forward in the meetings", said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe better times are flashing.
It seems that, according to unofficial information, the first official operator should arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now, his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
'At the moment we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is a very specific market compared to others.
Until now no one has approached us with any complex and serious project in this field", Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefonica O2, told mobil.cz.
The specific nature of the Czech market is also mentioned by other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional agreement with O2, adds: 'To date we have not recorded any viable commercial project that, mutually beneficial, can continue to develop.'
He adds: "It will be difficult to find a virtual operator on the T-Mobile network until the end of the year.
We should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in such a short timeframe".
Vodafone focuses its attention on the fulfilment of the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this concerns the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
We consider it precisely the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to establish a shared network with a partner for fast mobile internet".
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators is easy to understand, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competition which would lead to lower prices and thus to lower profits.
So why facilitate entry into the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull on the same string, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the ČTU was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by the public information available on the ČTU's websites.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: 'Furthermore, the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was recently opened up to a fourth operator.
As regards the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would impose high demands on it and, above all, on its services.'
This is why this access to mobile operators is extremely discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the CTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This is purely the responsibility of the Office for the Protection of Trade Bids (OPCW).
However, the Commission expressed its typical position on this issue.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement on the lease of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator has been concluded.
To date no agreement has been concluded as the offer of potential interested parties was not interesting enough for the traditional operators", added Kristián Chalupa, from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
These statements do not surprise the operators' representatives.
For the offices which must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, and they must also ensure that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign countries where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in mobile phone prices"
The pressure to ensure that the market conditions are correct and that prices are lowered is obviously not in the interest of the ÚOHS.
What is really dramatically shocking about this whole case is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence, it offers itself.
It is the same as with the price of petrol at petrol stations, because it is clearly the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
'The Office has found no evidence of unfair competition in this respect and therefore has no grounds for any intervention.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore they do not have a corresponding increase in responsibility for their market behaviour.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as well as telecommunications regulators", added Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets by ČTÚ that telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of commercial tendering.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer a different view - for a virtual operator to emerge, agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
It must therefore be dominant in a particular segment.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are moving up in strikingly similar fashion.
The current complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators they encounter many similar impediments.
Charging the CTU with responsibility is a fairly common trick in the telecommunications field from which the ÚOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We've met him before in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act to extend the competence of the ČTU in the field of commercial tenders was recently introduced, but it did not come into effect, even though a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of the OHIM must know this perfectly well, but their interests are clearly elsewhere.
Everything's fine, when no one's looking
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator is still operating unnoticed, which already exists in a few Czech mobile phone networks.
They are companies that set their own prices for mobile telephone services, but only a part of them are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list from these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this kind of resale.
"If cases like the one you mention were discovered, it could be said that the contractual conditions were breached and that this could result in the end of the partnership with the company", Martina Kemrová said when asked about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity by mobile phone operators would not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, it may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
The activities of these companies generate not insignificant profits and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the potential problems: "The law allows for this type of speculation, yet the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card of their phone is not in their name and therefore they cannot have it at their disposal as a normal customer of the operators".
This is precisely what should seem to the CTU minimally strange.
A new question for the OHCHR also appears.
If mobile operators are eyeing this kind of procedure, why are they blocking the virtual operator's entry?
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it does not want to it should not be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As already stated in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market led to a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where the virtual operator emerged, the conventional operators tried to more or less protect themselves from this breakthrough.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in no case have they defended the operators but their customers.
Whether it was with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to bring out the first virtual operator and with him began to emerge others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulator is passing this whole case by like a burning nail.
We cannot help but be impressed by our experience that the confusion of powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start moving again.
If any of the operators allows any virtual mobile operator to enter, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech official celebrations day presented the new official recording of the anthem Where is my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one with male voice and one with female voice, one with Choir and one instrumental.
The singing is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
The four versions can be heard on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful.
Czech Radio has said before that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices who are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with both and then, also, with the Choir to look at the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance", he commented.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home was first played in 1834 on the stages of the Theater of the States in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged to music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people embraced it.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in the year 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD in Prague brings us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers entered the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
It can be purchased at this moment by almost a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it onto their chip card at the transport company's information centres and stations at the Metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The bonds can be purchased online from yesterday on the transport company's website, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about the ticket booths in the metro stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window available to passengers with trained staff who help those interested with the purchase on the internet and also with the recharging of the voucher purchased on their card", said the spokesman for the project, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to top up the electronic voucher in the Opencard at vending machines in some subway halls.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, reminiscent of a ticket machine, and travellers may have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty", Opatrný added.
The bond is controlled by the machine instead of the driver.
The operation of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
The electronic vouchers from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the ring-trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 used mainly by the inhabitants of the central Bohemian towns.
"On trains in Prague integrated transport there are checkers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and zone of the ticket", explained ticket controller Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid which sets the timetables for Prague public transport.
Circular buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver's compartment.
When entering the car, you must not only show the card to the driver but also accompany him with the Opencard in the designated place on the side of the box.
The driver then controls the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than to request the driver this information", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on the ring-route buses and do not remember when their voucher expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeasterners wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum.
The German Sudetenland asked in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter which is kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
This is the wish that some Sudeten German groups allegedly addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of letters kept in a private archive and which are now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Šumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that the American units are arriving on German soil not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators", the letter reads, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
Since the union of Czechoslovakia with the southeastern Germans presumably means - according to them - that the Czech national character is a hope only for brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take Šumava under a protectorate for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we will be handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the Allies", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably fear of reprisals from the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president were presumably to doubt this idea of the Šumavas, it would be enough to organise a referendum in the Šumavas lands on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the US or live under its patronage.
Although the letter's text may sound childish, some experts say it aptly portrays the expectations of Germans in the southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have had a slight sense that they were about to be expelled from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to learn Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, the Czech would be good for them", Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Benevolent Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This is how the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday could be characterized.
The office of the minister, Aleš Řebíček promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous driving.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in leaflets.
I'd have to dissuade the driver from speeding and drinking at the wheel.
And also to remind you to fasten your seat belts before you leave.
It is intended to raise awareness among young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that strike at emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in big letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay".
This should symbolize that a man in a moment of despair can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will "scare" viewers into 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon countries where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
He promises that in this way he will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The advertisements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whipping for drivers
"The system of sugar and whip applies to drivers.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he passes a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risks", says transport psychologist Martin Kořán of the hospital in Na Homolce.
And that is why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, he says, are the warning signs.
"If there is a warning sign, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay much attention to it", Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace.
The President of the Israeli provisional government, Ehud Olmert, has declared that he will return virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that it appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means we must necessarily return almost all (occupied) land if not all", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will certainly keep a certain percentage of these lands, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israel's lands) because without this there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to go over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem", Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic place" that is located inside the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty in the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hezbollah (Chita movement), they must relinquish the permanent support that terrorism provokes from Hamas (Chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq", the prime minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are flight attendants on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a bus long distance
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padua, we are asked whether flight attendants and passengers can move about on the bus during the journey.
"If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the flight attendant is opposed to the traffic law", says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 22-year-old flight attendant died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe seat of the vehicle despite having two other seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake suddenly, and at the very moment when the steward is delivering the coffee or the newspapers.
The role here is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no places to stand, which the company's director, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have resolved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally they removed it and we came to an agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat", he told us.
The stewardess doesn't know the law.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the stewardess' role - no legal provision clarifies this function.
There is no legal provision that prohibits transport agents from providing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term vehicle inspector, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds, less bluntly, spokesman Hanzelka.
The head of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law is not doing enough to address this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have standing places.
That's all", he says.
Buses are divided into urban, with standing places and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places with a higher speed permit and long distance without standing places, with the higher speed permit and seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's expert on transport safety, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems with the movement of the bus driver.
"During the development of the journey there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service in airplanes.
Even here, you can't be sure that the turbulence will come and the stewardess will get hit in the head".
"However, if the bus suddenly stops, it is obvious that the laws of physics are valid.
Same as on a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier", she says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers flight attendant service.
He employs 200 people.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will suppress it.
The coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers on entering.
It would even save expenses", he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason Asiana lacks flight attendants in its vehicles, according to Alexei Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no flight attendants, we've been against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
A great tragedy has happened.
In the accident on the line linking Naples a young flight attendant from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably veered off the parking lane blocking the bus's path without using the lights.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid him, however, he crashed into the right front.
Jančura denies that the two places that are reserved for the flight attendant's rest were sold.
"These sites are not possible to reserve for long distance connections, they are blocked".
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict on the girl's family's compensation but it's waiting for the financial costs as well from the guilty party.
Reform of the law?
Not for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the flight attendant in the bus in which for a year now thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport are working.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They are not too concerned with buses, but rather with the points system, maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while walking", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the flight attendants to be something that threatens the safety of passengers in a significant way", concludes spokesman Hanzelka, who said that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf is backed up by Frankfurt
The letter from the board of directors of West LB Bank to its employees is full of words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf Bank and DEKA Bank units can create a central capital market for the Sparkassen financial group, as the letter published on Monday states.
West Bank LB, breaking the 'block of competition' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
Moreover, such a merger may be a prelude to further mergers in the field of regional banks.
This is how the text is understood when a board of directors wants to show its ability to act in difficult times.
Because just like before, West LB is under enormous pressure.
The Commission is not only aware of the European Union's position but also of the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
There has been much talk for some time now, also on the Frankfurt side, of such a merger between DEKA Bank, known to Sparkasse's customers for its investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA Bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, made it known that he saw no point in merging the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA board of directors, which now consists of the regional banks and the Sparkassen associations, instructed the board of directors to start negotiations with West LB on joint business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, so it says on the financial site.
It is not the first time that the name of DEKA Bank has been mentioned in connection with consolidation in the Sparkassen sector.
In 2003, at one point, it looked as if DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate instead started a dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But the idea of merging DEKA with other regional banks was always being toyed with.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba's board of directors, expressed that he was against the plans for coexistence with his bank.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the banking sector is able to compete effectively with the public sector.
The merger of BayernLB and the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress when the Bavarian parliamentary elections are due.
For the Helaba, that's not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to build, Helaba will be short of partners to do that.
In the south the bank may be just a young partner, although so far it has fared much better from the financial crisis than did the buildings in Stuttgart and Munich.
The Hesse-Thuringia Sparkassen-und Giroverband, which owns 85% of Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans to coexist with West LB.
In any case, it's just the Nord LB.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only part.
The other is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end, West LB can be broken up, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
So, also in the letter from the bank's board of directors it says that we would try to find a complete solution for the whole bank
How you can combine coexistence between single parts of the bank with the DEKA, that's gonna show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians".
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth.
But this time, he's being assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer, is a huge tiger bear built to show nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds it can produce in its throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, heading Munich, the beer party, expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the parking lot corners next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with a leather lining and glasses with silver spikes, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to Oktoberfest, considering that this year alone there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 10.30 the return.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the way on the highway with the address "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
The bus is quiet, the passengers are asleep.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates make another stop on motorway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group arrives at 6.30 a.m. in the car park next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already some 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left side, it says "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letters is the website of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the camp tent open, that means 'make a move!'", Marco shouts in the early morning.
"March!" March and take the back seats in the campaign tent.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all you yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, spread out over all the space!"
A liter of beer, Marco, is 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he leaves his seat, he will be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly 10:30 you must be here!" Do you understand?
And now they're all going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow hats on trees, traffic signs and even on a poster of the election of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You wish you could recognize the way back.
It's the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as "the weekend of the Italians".
There are no exact figures on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the journey over the Alps and tormentedly enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with over 200 medical assistance, are ahead of the English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians in first place.
The favorite camping shop of the Italians is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The banking system in Germany is relatively stable, stressed just last week Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück.
It is good that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that's after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich-based real estate financier listed on the DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to help it weather market turbulence.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters that credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to yield interest.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The cause of that is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was lent for long-term projects financed them only for a short period - which now, because of distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank's cash capital reserve fell by 95 percent, to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio fell slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared with the same period last year, the continuing income from financial investments and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, the income from the charge to debtors and some securities and the income from the liquidation of provisions from credit business decreased by more than 70%, by EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high income from the reimbursement of the compensation for the restructuring costs of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the Federal Tax Code and the business organised for the consortium companies, the negative balance could lead to a deficit of around 16 per cent more.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state-owned financial institution initially became involved in speculation with industrial real estate loans, which led to the foundation of Aareal bank.
As there was little money to be made from state project funding, Defa began to focus heavily on infrastructure projects and on financing community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the consolidated loss and profit account of the group, it is said very imprecise.
It's a fact that they've canceled the dividends.
By 2007, they were cancelled by two thirds.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Belgian authorities on the measures in question.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it is more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market than other banks.
With the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, interbank lending fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of the Defa credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers the group's short-term financing needs with a loan and the company is insured against "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of Hypo Real Estate, explained that Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The German central bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the unbalance of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even conceivable that the full volume of funding would not be needed.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
The word was that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so the temporary rescue can not reassure at least concerned people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
The loan courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While senior debt remains almost unchanged, the rates of borrowing according to the position in the land register are clearly trending downwards.
The loans from the former Württemberg subsidiary Hypo are particularly affected and therefore those whose maturities exceed 2009 are also affected.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a selective advantage in the form of State aid.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can start with the amortisation of pensions on time.
Or something will happen, which nobody dares imagine - the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's gonna be one reason, because creditors will spend sleepless nights, busting their heads over the decision on their enthusiasm isolation.
Still short-term investors can put the endpoint and use the carry-over of losses for future tax payments of profit compensation on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent-Box?
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to report to Tachibana High School, the girls started laughing: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
"First day at school in Japan.
I was nervous.
I was scared before I went to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the start of classes is not set as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
At eight in the morning the students come, at nine minutes past twenty a small meeting with the teachers begins, the 'home room'.
Before class started, I had to introduce myself.
I'm also not a person who likes to speak in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since they still have school uniforms, I put on an old skirt from my host family's mother and a blouse, blue socks, and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this, I stood in the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana"... - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At that moment I was very happy because I had already begun to study this language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class have been whispering and laughing and signaling and all the time I've been hearing the word "kawaii"
I knew her from my Mangoes.
That's from the Japanese girl's survival vocabulary and means "cute, pretty".
Then I slid quickly into my seat.
The girl next to her had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the bell rang, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone was talking at the same time, laughing and asking a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then at recess, everybody took out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me--it's something other than boring German bread pieces.
I had rice and herbs, little sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and something like tofu meatballs.
Most of the time I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new flavor.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of pickled prunes in salt, buff!
In Japanese schools bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl prepares a very artistically made bento for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a recess.
I read about it in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see him here too.
"Why Japan?" my friends have asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always said:
"Well, because it fascinates me".
I finally prefer to read manga for years.
To better understand comics and culture, I started to study a little Japanese one day.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a thin streak for tradition and custom.
They're very valuable here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
Because everything is so well organized, I still don't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life".
Rats have feelings too
They say a rat or a cockroach feels danger and runs away, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the neuroscientist, is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
How can you control if they, behaving in a manner similar to ours, feel the same?
An online magazine called "Edge" has been publishing contributions from famous scientists for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else has not been able to prove so far, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we get into other species and include questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as other animals: it plays dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave similarly, so some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
I don't think so, of course.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transmit our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include circuits associated with human consciousness in the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short-term memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to suppose that even man is different from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in man's linguistic nature: Since most of his experience is bound up with language, this often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not dependent on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of animals, created however, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to explain how other animals' consciousness works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is neither measured because it has special hardware, nor analyzed by our experiences, then its research presents us with big problems.
Most of my speeches concern the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be made easier for scientific research.
You could investigate the processes of consciousness in animals without taking into account their contents, and that's what happens during short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the visualization example.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essential thing is to focus on the neutral correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: the two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what does that do for the senses?
I'm a little bit of a victim of the fact that in the emotional system, a part of the brain is activated that's responsible for that, just like fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view, sensations are very much fixed in part of the cerebral cortex, which is what distinguishes primates and especially humans.
From the standpoint of linguistic nature, classification of fine sensations follows because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others on a par with ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, thinks that sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brainstem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but concentrates more on the brainstem.
Since this network hasn't changed much during human evolution, it can refer to absolutely different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot argue with that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and humans feel like fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and humans behaving similarly feel the same?
When a cockroach sees danger, it runs away. Why is it afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behaviour does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That's true, the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, whereas cockroaches don't have at least one brain.
Is the brainstem responsible for sensations?
Even if it's possible to test it on men, how can it be tested on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to research emotional behavior in rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured for rats and men.
Since I don't investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You could say I don't see past my nose, but I'd rather move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that preparations would soon be made under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government views the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence in Ukraine's ability to host the European championship together with Poland", Wasjunik said.
"But that's not amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to be done in both countries".
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
The number of stadiums is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed", said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will not take its eyes off us".
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Platini that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that".
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation in relegation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Counterattack by Dennis Quaid in anger
She wanted to promote a new movie, she was talking in an interview about her private life - and she has issues with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and attacks back.
The long overdue war of the two roses in the ex-partner of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show a nasty fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful".
She didn't know the extent of his infidelity until after the divorce.
The reason for the disclosure of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - it tells a story of a failed marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being labeled an unfaithful husband was clear: It is "unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version", the 54-year-old told the "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it is very "unfortunate" that her 16-year-old son, Jack, is again "going to publicly remember the pain and changes, all that a divorce means to a child".
While Ryan lives alone after his divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently fathered twins.
And so he ends his statements by stressing: "Whatever happens, my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Airline and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than last year.
According to a recent study, airline tickets in Germany have become as much as 50 percent cheaper.
Airline tickets and hotel accommodations have become cheap again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter, it found a big change in the second half.
After many years of rising hotel prices, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared with last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose on average by 6.9 percent between January and March.
From April to June, prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weaker dollar, which was the cause of "the decline in the interest of American tourists in travel".
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, breaking a European record.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class passengers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights even became more expensive by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, airline ticket prices in Economy class, compared with the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the change in prices was more marked than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even fell by half.
The reason for the price change is on the one hand the increase in the sluggish economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market demand is declining.
On the other hand, there is strong competition for the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profitable long-haul flights by airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still doesn't go out to make the 11th goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the crash landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly in reaction to what had happened, I could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second goal", Hermann Rieger whistled in the booth entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the present were back in their seats.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist of HSV, enjoying a very high reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That's why your request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's head coach.
His order was the same: wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
"Today not everything was pleasant to see", Marcell Jansen added later.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have it "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg have to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory", said Martin Jol summarily.
This Monday the SV Hamburg will be 121 years old.
On Saturday's will the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it", said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the league's viewability than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their late players like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can not shine with their successes.
"We need more of the feeling and dribbling", Jol demands.
After the vote was lost
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the bank bailout dropped the Dow Jones index for a period to 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day loss of points in their history.
Then the Dow Jones picked up a little bit.
At about 8:30 p.m., one of the world's most important stock market barometers posted a 5 percent deficit at 10,579.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, dropped more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
At this time the biggest losers on the Dow Jones were American Express which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could match in value.
The shares of the bank Goldmann Sachs were down almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago a major investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The rescue plan provides for the provision of resources to buy so-called "rotten" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid off in one fell swoop if not step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial associations which during the course of the course can be collected to reduce the financial burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the US continue to fall
The billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the United States are not reassuring to investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and is negatively influencing the Dax.
Despite the state's projected financial market bailout, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses on the speculative shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite bailout actions on the part of the federal government and private banks, the stock of the Munich real estate financier a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell well below the psychological limit of 6000 points and traded a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Worldwide, financial markets fell.
Wall Street's opening day in New York started with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow dropped 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout bill, the Senate vote could be October 1st.
The other European markets also showed only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London fell 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris fell 2.9 percent.
In Asia the Japanese Nikkei main index after earnings fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the announcement of the capital increase Arcandor's shares lost on the MDax.
The private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism consortium also announced that the shares in Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's theory of relativity may not be as correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now you threaten death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuver, has puzzled researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of spacecraft during which they gain acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example Earth's.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick just like the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what has surprised researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected by the venerable law of gravity.
Rather, they frequent irregularities of speed.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicists couldn 't explain this effect until now .
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be as correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, now solemnly believes as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers were left in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth", he writes.
Universe researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for ten years.
She is supposed to possess the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter makes up at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The kidnappers in Sudan had demanded millions in ransom.
Six kidnappers are to be killed in a shootout during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations regarding the ransom have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper reports on the most important cases.
Apparently the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are being released.
The same information is reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
After news of the release on Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24, Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'We are now monitoring his health status,' Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are safe and well, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shootout before the hostages were released: According to descriptions from an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom", the guard said.
It was just "taking hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and arrested two of them in the Sudan-Chad-Egypt border area.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, the money being paid for the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to stay in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Abuse by stepfather "led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he pleaded guilty to eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro Royal Court, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly bound his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote on a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court heard that Mrs Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted upon twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Ms. Rande's friends had said about her, that after having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now looked "emotionally dead", as if she had "renounced life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concludes: "I used to tie her up and blow her eyes out.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when she was only seven.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clear, if she had not done so, the matter probably would not have ended up in the courts".
He added: "I have noticed the effect that Stephanie's father and mother's description of the abuse had on their daughter over the years.
Clearly, she could have had a promising, successful, happy future".
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC has been informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June is going to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a business trip for the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
The BBC's Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the British administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Juridical Service pointed out that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained classified information on al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain construction companies could face a price tag of over £80,000 after the bailout of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government, in effect, provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the savers' money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest accruing in the meantime is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial undertakings which have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently... are being called upon to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
This means that each company had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits and that the brokerage companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450k in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to recover £81,000 to meet the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies Trade Association, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the housing market are being called upon to pay the price produced by those that were far less prudent".
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect building societies and their members against what could be a relevant price", added Mr Cole.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to March.
In 2010, this will be a full year of interest payable, which may be almost double.
Since building societies are mutual organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk goes up by five pence a litre.
The people of Jersey will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will rise by an extra five pence a litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February and following research by a consultancy firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she can be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His lawyers said the court did not grant him bail accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption charges against him.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-backed government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they'll appeal the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina arguing that she could not get bail because she was already under treatment abroad on parole", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to appeal the Supreme Court's order".
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, an Awami League leader said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against them.
Fears for the polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says UN - have been unable to benefit from a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite pledges made by the Taliban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of officials as they carried out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge before the Competition Commission following the decision to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeal Court that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV to below 7.5%.
The Commission has previously said that BSkyB's interests hinder competition and allow it to exert unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Antitrust Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin's chief executive Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the compulsion to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New investigation into the hiring of U.S. attorneys
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticized the actions by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved", Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to give statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department justified the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for underperformance.
But it later became known that the lawyers had not been rated worse than their peers, and many observers concluded that the layoffs would be politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of election fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
And they can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the firings, resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is highly critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and stresses how he had "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, who "resigned" from his leadership position and was "notably uncooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former aide, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic Meat Loaf of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said it would be "an honor" to receive the honor.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The band Coldplay are taking the nominations for this year's awards and making the rankings for the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them".
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like that used by Meat Loaf.
An almost two-minute instrumental section opens the anthem.
The song was first released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained on the charts for about nine years and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after collapsing during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced her to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal chord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets, and other roads, some famous, others simply serviceable.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The little street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street  before I found Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little alley, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alleyway rather than an active road.
There's no sign of him.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
who wants to repaint Extra Place and create a clean aisle to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime residents who commented being delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block's past before the building's takeover.
However, the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which controls the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the community land use committee meeting this month, representatives from the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community No. 3, said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place", said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street".
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seating, including some to be used as a cafe, pending rental of the space.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month's meeting.
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area", he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is the development of the property rather than the management of it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opens into Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that appears on the cover of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The setting was magnificent", said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public property, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a rift in the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk from the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead-end alley, dark even in the daytime and marked by rust-iron warehouse doors and shutters, with weeks-old newspapers blown along the ditches".
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured across the back of the street and stood near the door that used to be used to enter the CBGB and now houses a high-end clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22 oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention at Extra Place, but suggested that it might get a clean.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its present state.
"I spent the best years of my life", he said, "in dark, damp, and disgusting places".
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this Education Watch episode, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice".
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a tough business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of this.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning outcomes, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English-speaking learners.
The question open to Mr Obama, however, is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in canceling the distance in final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and from low-income families:
More than a third of the students, many of them newcomers, are learning English.
Yet an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been rated positive in the 2008 math test.
And almost equally astounding 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant evaluation of competence and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school's approach to teaching students English is "total immersion".
Immersion in English means almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the content of instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We've had extraordinary success with students like this last one who came from Mexico and who, if you walk into the classroom 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to pick up what was".
"It works", he said, "we think it works".
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to be replicated by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of his party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their own constant support for bilingual education obscure Mr. Obama's prediction of the answer.
While it is true that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "You have to make sure your child can speak Spanish".
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than dismissing or trivializing them.
Oil prices plummet after renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid concerns that the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than 20 dollars a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before falling back once again due to the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by renewed concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
The latest development in the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, according to a government statement Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the frantic weekend, the negotiations leading up to the bailout deal "appear to have failed to revive market sentiment".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for basic commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rates is going to be increasingly uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is evaluating whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China".
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption drops due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After spending the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then he saw how things played out in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a deflationary game.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis remarked.
The second quarter started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had played sluggishly under the shadows of the clouds.
It was at this point that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard field goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon when the evolution of the relationship between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth quarter, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds left in the half.
"I didn't go out of my way", said Favre of all the steps leading to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think".
While Favre and Coles were out in the bullpen, the Cardinals defense was beating up quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walk and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Eric Safety Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to win a definitive 34-0.
That's the most points the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
Team coach Eric Mangini, asked to describe the madness of this moment, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When asked about both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third quarter.
They've gained a lot of points in a very short period of time".
Gebrselassie rested to top his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has proved why many consider him the greatest runner in history, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the comfortable race on flat land in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has shattered by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, set last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of an impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the time trial race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not participate in the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to race in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, averaging a blistering 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long-distance runners, the marathon record has shrunk by more than two minutes in the last decade as Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
Clearly the suspension left him cool, not rusty.
"I'm very happy", Gebrselassie said to reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well".
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Eastern rival - for his style of over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the halfway mark in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers declined.
But just three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took one last push to separate himself from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi came in third place in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also took part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did a cleverly calculated run, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners do heads and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, the pride and trials of color life
Hidden by the expansive theme park of the greater Orlando, just a few miles from the glittering, noisy, colossal city, lies a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first entirely black incorporated city in the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a jail".
It's a pilgrimage site now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described - also making it a tourist stopover by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the depression season - remains a place apart.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who does not know what he is missing".
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain wary of the outsider.
"We're very cautious about how our story is told", said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right".
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historic model of black affirmation and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a poverty level twice the national average.
It's a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural black Southern culture -- sometimes despised, sometimes praised -- that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if the residents here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a highway that runs through central Florida often forgotten inward black history and human drama.
Having a concrete face in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Outside the road on the left", he wrote, "is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, tended by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write".
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described him as he was", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized, quoting men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that".
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora", continues Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, rocking in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was likely baptized, "she never stayed too long".
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her legacy was understood", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the 80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the working community's main two-lane street.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix brought hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys, they would go around town throwing oranges and everything at the people who were sitting next to them", said Mr. Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
He was thrown into a watermelon from the car".
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honored my race".
Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this  it was used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the evening", said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there", said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons  black writers, actors and artists who went above and beyond prejudice, just as she did, with buzzing, confident lines like, "How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand you".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into the American canon.
The road project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community started planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposed road.
"The resurrected idea of the five-lane road, would have been to put in what you would call curve speed, a real civic pride", said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
People from out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church here in 1993, started showing up in large numbers, and residents started checking the past.
Eatonville was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new library (bearing Hurston's name, of course) opened in 2006, on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like you're on a street from the past under a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Strangers who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A prior permission is required to do most interviews, and some things - like the murals at Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous and self-confident teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, so has a greater level of native pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, dumb and mixed.
It's a sincere sense of civic pride that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare come here, will have to think, 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to any other,'" says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it's a very nice city".
Around here in New York, everyone talks about finances.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the beehive offices that lie above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst "bad office day" since the 1929 slump.
Home delivery boys are still ringing their metal tea trolleys through the sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins to breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to crawl between locked apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric printed shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders.
Employees still wait in line for their bagels at vendor carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JPMorgan Chase branch, a line of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers sort their checkbooks, tourists look for directions to Macy's department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people were ahead of me, I was informed later by Starr, my "personal banker of trust", and they were in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places they had switched from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had drawn their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a building society), credit unions and savings banks in their home town whose branches only operate within the state of their affiliation, and which claim to treat customers like family.
During the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a buyer for the bailout.
The office and store workers who were standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank in what is considered a safe haven, which is what most bailouts on Wall Street are doing.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressed-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was talking about the matter familiarly as if they were complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, 50-something uniformed janitor from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, from Belgium, affiliated with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to introduce the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs that represent mosques with a red line crossing them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have been an attempt to hide the real motives of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's unclear if the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim worshipers as the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is bracing for a round of introspection after the right-leaning swing in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The two far-right parties that grabbed almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also expressed his opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At their last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the Islamization policy underway in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change was mainly brought about by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police issued the travel ban last Thursday after magistrates produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by solicitor Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Justice Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling abroad such as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person".
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as he was on the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
You must also notify the police of the planned date of departure seven days in advance.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and to minimise any risk to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he caught a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Magistrates Court in Uxbridge, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A Home Office source reported that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was reassured and delighted to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I catch the master off-scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels or flyers or opening costumes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration on performance to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
The artist aside.
The other, the person.
Separate except in intimacy, in those moments of being out of the public eye, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hand, carefree because they're not going to come on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, growing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, when looking at the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
My interest was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco players".
With the flavor of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, due to the choice of camera and material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the act of dancing, singing or touching itself, but the artist's personality, his character, that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the leprechaun who makes himself visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous figures of the flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter an instant in their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think that within photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or confront people, characters, who sometimes you don't even know, or who only give you a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 de la Mata Street, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel she writes is "a temerity"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown subjects, but even so, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to carry out the new project on which he is working, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If I were sensible, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime", he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the highlights of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience to whom the hour was made very short in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined way" to replace his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and redoing a lot; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience", Vargas Llosa stressed, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more uncomfortable", so he asked writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "assume responsibility" their vocation.
Climatology is diminishing the Pozoblanco fair, which also runs out of regions
The festival of regions that closed the ferry ferry to Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
The company, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the race.
The weather conditions have been a major reason for the fair, as two of its three festivals have not been held.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second scheduled bullfight from taking place.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a Castilblanco lockdown
So, only on Friday there was a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante sold his two stakes with greetings and an ear, which gave more to the stakes than his bullfight.
Of course, even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Los Llanos thing without pain or glory.
In his second bullfight, after a relief effort, he won the scolding of a large part of the crowd.
They're skipping a checkpoint in Alava in a van with 2,000 kilos of hashish.
Five to ten o'clock in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
Officers stop the two occupants of a van and they flee.
His cargo, over two tons of hashish, was not stopping.
The officers chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The individual arrested has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident occurred when several officials from the Traffic Unit of Álava were conducting a transportation control on the N-1, as it passed through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated abruptly, and lost control.
Officers began chasing the vehicle until it stopped a couple of miles later in the sand, at which point its two occupants packed up to run through a wooded area.
The ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2.178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish, so they took it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not match the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrested has also been charged with a crime of falsification of public document.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as said, and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A.A.J., 28, was taken to police headquarters for the following proceedings and will be taken to court in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the hit TV show Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers as she tried to exit her parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping on the gas, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and going backwards he passed several times over his sunglasses".
Shortly after, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear pull over on a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented", so the agents took her to a drug and alcohol specialist to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was ruled out from the start, although "as officers observed at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was booked into the local jail around 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from a treatment clinic in Arizona where he was recovering from an anxiety episode and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to take over its competencies in the Silva case
IU's general coordinator and Izquierda Unida deputy, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the regional federation of the formation will have to make a decision on the case of former youth and sports councillor Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of making deals for family.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competencies", Llamazares said of the action the party must adopt with the one it has so far counciled in the Seville consistory.
However, the IU leader defended the need for "transparency" in the possible investigations into the irregularities Silva may have committed: "IU has always defended that this type of matter has the highest degree of transparency".
In the same vein, he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions".
'May Blood', the epic bet of Garcia
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's Episodios Nacionales, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de mayo, the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a broad cast of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a film time of more than two and a half hours, is released in cinemas on Friday, becoming a future miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this filming "a childhood dream", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2 Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget provided by the Community of Madrid is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to create a portrait of "an insolent Spain that was wrong about the boss to fight for, because the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding like Alatriste or Goya's The Ghosts - more than double that of Sangre de mayo -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes captured in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
The director of "Rever a empezar" has therefore made a point of putting on stage his usual way of working, with actors, with whom he usually rehearses before filming starts and who he does not cast, because it seems "humiliating" and considers that "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and the cinema to find out what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre de mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee - one of which he won - Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, the Sangre de mayo, Seven tables of French billiards and the final selection, Los girasoles ciegos, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that should be made known", he has assured.
With this film, Garcia doesn't expect any awards.
"At first you think you are working for posterity, then you realize you are only working for prosperity, and now you are content to make one more film", explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to pay tribute to a dancer also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a freestyle dancer and an oriental dancing specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was amazing".
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of their dances have given me the impression of flamenco sticks.
So, "butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "serpent dance" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic", she says.
The installation features two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of his shows, as he did in "La puerta abierta"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilde plays Tortora as an adult, the character of maturity.
I'm happy that she's accepted to act in my play and I'm very honored by that".
The installation also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the cante of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all their extent, and who are always in love with them".
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have a huge influence in a certain era and now no one knows and much less values her work", says Bayón.
The show will start today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Cove of Light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
The Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has also acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America is less like without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
The line is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absent of Malice", and it gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, at the shocking thought that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
Still, it's been a slap in the face for everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond words, and I have now lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of his existence".
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerate.
A father of the motion picture and of the country had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and the markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately searching for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and men are virtueless and very few beings to admire remain, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
She embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and gained causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn son who died of an overdose to his homemade and organic food brand.
A gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The surge of admiration swept Hollywood regardless of nationality or passport.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said that not one man but an era had died.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has set a very high bar for all of us", said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping the demand for probity and having a serious private life away from the cameras high.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is an example.
He divorced once but then was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had plenty of opportunities not to be.
"But why would I eat hamburger outside if I have steak inside?" he used to joke to himself.
In heaven, he is proud that on earth his daughters match his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and devoted philanthropist", they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
It was called the perfect race, and in my opinion it was the worst race by far I've ever been in.
A heap of nonsense which, of course, if you took it as an evaluation and I examined it, it would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go through the parts and start at the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the backpack picking up, which makes you have to go before.
Which I don't think is bad, but if they already make you go they give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, you didn't.
Here you were only made to go to pick up the backpack (first nonsense, go only for that) and (behind the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What kind of world are we living in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only smaller T-shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a trifle compared to the race day stuff.
Besides having to go very early to pick up the chip, the line at the arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once we did, the pick-up was worse.
In addition, the rain amended the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by connotations of popular rebellion and assault on the house.
I think about 500 people are probably gonna have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they're not even gonna show up at the right time in the qualifying, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn't mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if you asked me about the perfect career, this would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown a breakthrough of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) by listening to what it hears in conversation.
Using a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words in their conversations.
Also group the attendees according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he is not from the group she is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if she's there to visit someone and says she'll be there soon.
All without blue screens.
That's really impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of its operating system, Windows.
There's been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will have fewer associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has found that if computers came with essentials instead of commercial garbage loads, they would go five times faster -- man, Steve, it's already for less.
A remarkable finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It serves the same function as your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true, you know.
It will never go away but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer just starts up to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the Windows environment.
What's half the applications that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo for this post was taken in one of the Microsoft employee lounges in Redmond earlier this month.
At the soda machine, a sign asks you to use your search tool - "Your Search. Our Future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not come in early 2009 but in late, rather pulling in 2010.
Microsoft will probably look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The telephone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to take its toll.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and it's part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start listing stellar appearances, we can trace back to the image of that pointy-whiskered outcast who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's cotton undershirt, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', as the English speakers call it, but the Marcel Fabuleux of Brussels stands out above all others.
First, by her rambunctious name - although she is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because she is named, according to legend, after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the rest for its excellent cotton, unisex cut, distinctive shield and the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag that the most iconic T-shirt models wear as a detail around the neck.
And watch out, because the Belgian firm's production isn't just focused on their tank tops.
Also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailor shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for comfort underwear.
It's a shame to leave them as underwear, though.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
Her enormous resemblance to her sister has not prevented her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is tiny but full of vitality.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than just beautiful, famous girls named after her.
He has been in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm does in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins at short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new Mango collection based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both love movies from the 1950's and 1960's.
Then I really like to get lost in a city and watch women dress, how they mix and match their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it all comes together and they have a lot in common.
I loved clothes when I was younger, and I longed to go to my grandmother's house to look through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to be careful about how I dressed.
You know, dancers love to make our own stylings for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you're given the costume, that's when you really find the character.
So, it all comes together, of course, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You're not that old, have you had a breakdown?
What's up?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that women are made, have experience and taste life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of the biological clock.
I've done the things I wanted to do since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me to be, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you're still waiting for a few releases you shot last year.
That's right, and I can't wait for them to see the light.
I, who am a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can not be.
I can't wait for the release of The Last Hour and Searching for Christ's Tomb.
Let's see what you think.
A few days ago, you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I was going up a catwalk to model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a while, to invite me to go to London to participate in a benefit parade for her organization Women for a Better World, and the clothes we were showing -- I took two pieces from our collection for Mango -- were being auctioned off to raise money for this NGO of Naomi's.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi's.
There are so many things said about her that, if I knew her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna keep that really good part of her getting involved.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he ever asks me to make the pine, so be it.
For the benefit of third world women, whatever it takes.
Drivers who have a history of alcoholism must install an alcohol lock
Interior wants drivers with three administrative penalties for alcoholism to have to install a system in their vehicle that prevents them from starting the vehicle drunk, or if they don't blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Attorney General's Office, which says it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose of this is to reintegrate the driver, so that he will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the General Traffic Safety Office, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will also participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers who are reported more than once for drunk driving re-enter the car.
The alcolock would prevent this as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow off the bottle; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than the permitted.
The cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the person who was sanctioned.
In this respect, a 2007 study in the USA showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% in the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 lives every year.
The measure is based on administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before it leads to criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and, however, the necessary reform by the criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's own resources are used for the financing of the projects.
In Mexico and no peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the time scheduled in the program, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced one to use one's hand as a visor to watch the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish but lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar, glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marines performing the salute of honor.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, is in the wind, very sober, not using her usual peep-toes, perhaps she had been told that there was a storm in the DF.
They give a smile and a brief stop to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the big four in the city, a female reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The most gifted fashion prize
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no designer alive more exquisite and good-living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Butón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her designs in the Mango window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it's the second largest store of the firm in Europe and it just opened with 1,335 square meters of floor space.
The first one is in London.
All these events, coupled with the desire to thank designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the competition, led to a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera House in Paris.
With the finest Chagals nearby, the presidential dinner table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken with grief and heart-breaking, by her brother's recent passing, put on a suit of House and some breath-taking Elah's trimmings, and her son Louis' arm - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in presiding over his tribute dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron de Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store in pants and a shirt - of her own design - and for dinner transformed herself in a sexy long black dress, was thrilled when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed hold of one of the bars and made a 'grand plie' amago.
Inés Sastre did not stop to walk around the palace premises, but instead showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight of Olivier Martinez - another motorcycle-driving cannon - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his sheets and towels and having asked in advance that there be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there it is, that's life.
1001, the stress-relieving number.
There are not a thousand but a thousand plus a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And if that wasn't enough, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself caught up in the hectic pace of life today.
The office is called tension and the computer is a pain in the back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily burnout and disconnection from the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less than, 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott has put together a menu of options in the pages of a book, tailored to the tastes and minutes of each person.
The anti-stress book is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will be coming to bookstores from the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that peace of mind cannot be found in areas such as work or in personal relationships, this 'handbook' refutes that belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is no longer running through your veins to restore your body's balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very awake telling us something about the day before, but children who talk in their sleep.
The first time it happens, you might get a little scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign sleep disorder called somniloquy.
It's quite common, especially in children and teenagers.
I'm sure more than one of you have heard that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month, etc.), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its occurrence.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (peeping in your sleep) or sleepwalking, but this need not be the case.
As mentioned above, they may also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
It's a little-studied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it appears is also highly variable.
He may speak in a calm tone of voice, with loose words, a murmur, or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches, etc.).
In cases where the symptoms are very severe, it is advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if there is something that is causing the child to become very anxious.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stressful picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who find it very difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a measure of inner calm.
This will help the child to sleep more soundly.
Once the sleepiness starts, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that happened.
Useful Tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his sleep.
Even though he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember, if you are very anxious during several episodes, you may want to check to see what is causing the child's anxiety.
If you can understand what he says (which is not usually the case), do not be tempted to interrogate him to get information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep and he's not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
Also, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to learn his secrets.
Not even for fun.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their home field after a long period of scarcity.
Having not played a good match, the team created many scoring opportunities and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very consistent during this encounter in which the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who brushed the squad with a shot from far away, Illhaeusern almost took the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from far away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the toe or also Diebold came to impede Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn't let the midfielder pass and left Riahi in the attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two scoring chances from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after opening the scoring for the Illhousiens with a goal from Marais, well placed to pick up the ball rejected on a first attempt from Diebold (53').
But the Illhousiens' goalkeeper will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the dressing room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not seize the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed up a bit to "compress" their defence, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major farful, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen angry
Before departing for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour around Britain.
The President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet his representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope he "will come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit coincides with the general meeting of the 'crisis committee' set up by Breton fishermen to get action on the rise in diesel prices, which have reached a record high of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesman for the Elysée, David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the employment and remuneration conditions of the seafarers".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy with their feet firmly planted.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
A filter barrier has been put up on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday by burning tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
Fishermen in La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges in the afternoon.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting on Wednesday at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the 'crisis committee' will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which did not support their motion.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen have not given up' and 'they do not want to move to Paris', said Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents a litre but believe that the financial break-even point of a vessel can be reached only with diesel with a price of less than 0.30 euro a litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of "Two Men and a Fate" has died of cancer, aged 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the movie legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recessionary threats weighing on the world economy.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, maintains its forecast deliveries for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, said.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell the aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would aim to sell more than 15% of its assets
American International Group, which has been bailed out by US monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets to repay its $85 billion loan, according to Sunday's edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to consider selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its U.S. retirement insurance, the paper says.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG intends to divest include its airline leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times reports.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity to repay its $85 billion Federal Reserve loan at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting it to the proper ratio among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris stock exchange
The New York Stock Exchange hit a historic low last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen on the stock market of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the day trading resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, a technology-dominant index, fell 199,61 points to 1,983,73 units and the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which was widened (extended) by 8.81 % (or 106,85 points), to 1,106,55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan", added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within a few days would come "too late".
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the US central bank, the N. of the Net) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities arranged for Wachovia's banking activities to be purchased by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing "not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis", the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has gone up dramatically.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 3.632 percent, down from 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond yield fell 4.161 percent, down from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
Friday's first debate between the two candidates at the White House was followed by another to see who has triumphed between John McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised mourning that has been watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant enough" to allow him to slow his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll released last Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that the Democrat did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out on top with 39% of those polled, while 25% of them give McCain the win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected performance of his fellow candidate, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts", Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining his opponent's "naivety" on these issues which were at the heart of this first row.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Without being puzzled, he was concise and precise.
It enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore America's image in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already", he replied this weekend to a Democratic television ad that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama denounced yesterday before 20,000 people who had gathered for an election rally in North Carolina under heavy rain.
He did not say the words "middle class" or "workers". "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the person most capable of saving the economy that is on the brink of collapse.
"Next week could be a decisive episode", estimated, yesterday, the influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless reduce taxes for 95 percent of Americans despite the upheavals on Wall Street, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving energy independence for the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, both candidates dodged the questions that concerned the 700 billion dollar (470 billion euro) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday afternoon by the extremely unpopular Congress.
"In Minsk, have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday afternoon on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the legislative results in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon after the closing of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, he must resign".
Some admit they did not vote: "Why, they will do what they want with my vote", says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime which has been welcoming the foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and asset freezes, could be lifted if the elections are deemed fair by observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We have been put on the side of the election commissions and our observers could not participate in the vote count", lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change", stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because it is who counts the votes that counts, and in our house, it is the executive.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
"But his entry into parliament may mean TV appearances, meetings in the regions and draft laws".
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debts to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don't reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent".
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not recognise the validity of the vote.
He stressed that turnout figures appeared to be too high and that the widespread early voting (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) had facilitated the manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections?" he asks the Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be at most five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones best suited to power".
The silence of the night returns again in the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And most of all, he regained the public's trust that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, national blood banks managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In the face of this tragedy and public discontent, the Canadian government conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, presided over by Judge Horacio Krever, to clarify the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent it from happening again.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his report, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been set up in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38 per cent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec", recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work over the years that followed, we have regained the public's trust", he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, reminds us that "trust is extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were seeing the emergence in Europe of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We therefore rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious illness may result from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by brain degeneration which inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999 we refused blood to people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But some years ago it was shown beyond a doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle applied made sense".
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that directly detect the presence of the virus in the blood of donors rather than antibodies against the virus, which were the basis of previous tests.
Nucleic acid tests shortened the time between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses could be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We can reduce the risk of certain donors being infected without us knowing and not being able to detect them.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-tainted blood.
"That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
So since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to get back to health without worry", says Héma-Québec's chief executive.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant", says Dr Décary, before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
"Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because more aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which represents on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood. "
All healthy persons 18 years of age and above who meet the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Hardship is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can't donate their blood anymore.
But it's hard to convince people to donate their blood, but it's hard to keep them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since life is so unbridled today, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood", laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was once considered biomedical waste, is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases like leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, the placement in the bank of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample and are expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We should start proposing it for grafts early next year", says Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this", since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL First Division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in summary finishes) win over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and deciding game of the quarterfinal series at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half with no goals from either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many scoring opportunities.
Roger Levesque was the only one who knocked Matt Jordan out for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the round-robin series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon at Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the rematch to take a 4-3 lead, but the Whitecaps nonetheless advanced to the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact are scheduled to face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short  Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn cheered the attack in a 3-2 Canadian free throw barrier win over the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the Tricolor's fourth in six preliminary games.
Kovalev won the game by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet", he warned the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable".
He tried to play his best in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He got a nice standing ovation".
Charest takes care of the North.
The Prime Minister does not rule out holding elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council ends, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected during today's by-election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern frontier': such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force by remaining on the broad lines at the end of the general council of the Quebec Liberal Party in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They showed, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Big media like during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening up of the North - the Northern Territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister did however explain why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but gave no timeline, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be developed more are: particularly hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, which is being boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This territory, twice the size of France, is our home, it's in Quebec.
It's not just our home, it's in us", he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely on its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future", he added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The north, 70 per cent of Quebec territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government", he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North", he said of the northwest passage, which will be opened every year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly the youth.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Quebec party deputy for Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting at which "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals before us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's rise to party power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois power station into the Adélard-Godbout reservoir.
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, to Lesage, who made the quiet Revolution and nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party forged the future", declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative one, the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that it was planned to be commissioned in 2012.
"This is between us, but I expect to be there", he told his supporters, drawing applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council to China and a Quebec-New York-York summit.
The general council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" which had no problem being accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party in particular demands the recognition of "Quebec specificity" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to grant them a right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we greeted the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The leader of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If she had done so, 'we would have made progress today' said Mrs Marois, standing next to her Jean-Talon candidate (voted today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the government's adoption of a Plan Nord.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show", said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - A country dishonored
It is Mr Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who last summer dared to say that Louise Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who fought a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says everything about the relationship between the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government which is the only one among all the Western countries involved which has not repatriated its national who is imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the events he is accused of were committed.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhuman conditions.
The only one who messes with a bogus justice system to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association in particular are supporting Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, certainly forever after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', that is the word Harper keeps repeating and it makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no morality: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the so far minority head of government wants (what happens after 14 October ?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has given up what it was doing to the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian discourse of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's largest gold company filed a six million euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution for libel, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to take a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that it would have had to present its view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, debates in Canada are normally done by changing ideas and not by baton blows.
It was enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could have clarified the matter.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate and disregard his views?
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, critics also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so mainly because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes of argument, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a persecution-bite (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada instructing them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold trial is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth, which are essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich corporations of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of much persecution, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to an objection.
The academic world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it is high time that governments put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stem the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular for better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized or not paid, and a right to control the salaries paid to the directors of the firms assisted.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican negotiator Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news just minutes after midnight yesterday, after a marathon of two days of negotiations.
"We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets", declared Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"It's the bottom line: if we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense", Republican Judd Gregg declared.
Negotiations had been winding down very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that a further failure would have on investors' mood.
The last time they had set was the markets opening this morning.
The two candidates in the US presidential elections, who have been late in joining the negotiations, were rather supportive of the agreement, without forgetting to express their dissatisfaction at being forced to go to this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach an agreement, particularly the one that would allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of the heads of the companies surviving by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, congratulations are not to be received.
But these measures are necessary", he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked on another network if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it".
"The important points I read [show] that it's something we're going to have to digest and move forward with.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable".
The 700 billion dollar plan is to use taxpayer money to buy off the dubious debts, risky assets and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other more common forms of credit bonds (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a break-up of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of elected Republicans who had the first draft deal changed last week.
We believe we have come out of the stalemate since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of troubled companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to smooth things over for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to take a five-year loss on this program, it could impose new fees that would purport to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In return for your help, Washington will get shares in the bailed-out companies that will pay dividends in case of profits and that it can sell again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the foreclosure proceedings on housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives starting today and the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this bill yesterday, both Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, declared to his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand".
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that is about taking advantage of the taxpayers".
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is a cheerleader for a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to say: we ask the Congress not to hurry and to examine carefully the way to go", he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we had proof once again of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Netherlands and Luxembourg Governments was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was not buying its bankrupt competitor after losing EUR 2 billion (USD 2.9 billion) during the US subprime mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not money wasted", declared Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we regain a voting right in the bank and influence.
It's just something savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain".
During this time, across the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and over 41 billion euros (75.5 billion dollars) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize at the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Her blue eyes represented her triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with the lovely smile broken free of his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident must have also kept him from the record of power that true sacred monsters have.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at age 83 of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American film icons of the glamorous years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he was very much like and who was long considered a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes great children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No overweening ego, the ultimate in quality.
Because it projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, the combatant of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before succeeding in theater, television and soon in film.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who was ranked second in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the world of show business that we do not know very well, disappear with him.
He's an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman has sent film buffs into a frenzy this weekend as his big roles collide on the black screen of memory.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual flux parades through it.
Many memories come back to mind as the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all its promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic Mango in the lavish movie The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and a vengeful man in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the role in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which won him his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes with age, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him best from George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in which Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team, is portrayed.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the Irish mob's godfather in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Unlike several film legends who left the business early enough, Newman stayed in the film business for a long time, denouncing Hollywood, its gems, its glitz and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in underplaying and judges its features too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of a young gallant than of a marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides of his true pudic sensibility not well known.
His 1968 film Raquel, Raquel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, depicted a female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
"Among the many tributes unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very sadly, "my life and my country were better because of his existence".
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the late actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there's also a great civil rights activist, ecologist, independent filmmaker, a challenger to Hollywood's excesses.
We have often seen his face reign over the jars of vinegar sauce, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a tasteless method, although it began as a gag.
The proceeds from these sales were donated to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, rather than settle for his myth, he'll be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that contained these words: "always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And it's a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What was produced at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
The criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will be opened very soon, on 8 October.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, as a business, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, among them the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, justifying the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public and municipal funds - some HUF 65 million in all - went partly into the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation and partly into the pockets of private individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were fake.
For this they obtained the stamps from the market in Józsefváros District and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question of which company to make the counterfeit invoice was decided among others in that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for his consumption and these served as a model for making the bills that he presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, as well as the City Council of the Capital.
These bills were signed mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this food centre provided food for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager of the center, not all the people can fit in at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For one hostel in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and no more than ten people could stay there in one night, yet the bill was for one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of large fantasy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft. food centre because in the bookshop of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he already knew that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp, our company name and ID number were in the wrong place".
He added: besides the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill 100 people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms that do not fit so many people.
In addition, the bill included meals, while the restaurant has not been operating for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoicers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organised only international trips, so that on the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated a journey within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency's invoicing practice.
In addition, as was found out during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, even though travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from tax.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of this company are not charged with 25 but only 15 per cent VAT, and the hotel employees only issued machine-made invoices but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "expeditor" made other mistakes as well, such as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as activity carried out the transport by road which - it became known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - does not perform the company founded as a consultant of investments.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate form of the invoice, false stamp - it became known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont were false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also failed to notice that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation, so the liquidation process manager - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They knowingly issued the invoices
Another group of counterfeit invoice makers are those who were aware that they were supposed to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about HUF four million in the name of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, also cooperated with Zuschlag and its accomplices and in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, without any real economic activity behind them.
There was no capital movement either, because after they canceled the bills prepared but forgot to include this entity in their documents.
The next group of counterfeit invoice makers include those who have some connection to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the fictitious Delta Trio SL based in Budapest, which was engaged in the trade of fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices for the sale of computer media worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices for the company's Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and collected the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they were not given work.
But he benefited from these companies, since at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company registration documents, they issued invoices in the name of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade issued a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecutor's office found that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the invoice amount.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri limited partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility of the Socialist Party.
They obtained HUF 500 000 respectively from the competition, but did not use the money for the competition's objectives.
To avoid this being discovered, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the bills found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably tell at trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the counterfeiting of the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
Well, his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not been done until now.
The question is: what interest does he have in doing so? Perhaps in return for the return of most of the money - HUF 50 million - the Socialists have reached an agreement with him that Zusi will take on all the responsibility.
Who, on the other hand, for these days even could be offended, since to ease his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of far higher value economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk free or at least can wait in their own homes for sentence, he has no chance for that.
Overlapping psychology: Why are we spending more money?
Participants in auctions are prone to spending more money and overvaluing the product.
Neuroscientists and economists at New York University have discovered the neurological-economic basis for this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose out on competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction, and the active areas of the brain of the experimental participants were examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants could win money, but during auctions, where betting more than the other is a fundamental element, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-reward" mechanism.
So according to scientists, the increase in gambling is explained as a prevention to avoid provoking an intense reaction of the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 prize.
The third group, on the other hand, received exactly $15 before the auction, but if they lost the auction, the group members lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that one group was highlighted as a success and the other as a failure.
However, testing the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the "fail-safe" group were willing to gamble even more than the members of the control group and the "win" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
The Commission has not yet been able to provide any information on the results of the auctions.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's Graduate School of Business.
Hepatitis: When should you see a doctor?
Worldwide, some half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is considered a leading cause of death in Hungary.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are being treated because many of the patients do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for several liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar - liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause are very different.
Hepatitis virus dependent on pathogen are spread by two main means: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with contaminated water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal humour, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers protect themselves by vaccination against A and B viruses, there are no vaccines against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating the infected food, and are manifested by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and whites of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, the urine dark and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Each year, one million people worldwide die from cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of the disease.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences. Without treatment, it can cause cirrhosis of the liver and even cancer.
Most people who are infected do not know they are sick because this pathogen gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms do not appear until 20 to 30 years later.
So early detection, systematic medical monitoring is very important.
The disease is much more common in three groups: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattoo wearers.
There are now about 200 million people worldwide who have chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can be detected with a routine laboratory check-up as well, it is worth consulting your family doctor if you experience any unknown symptoms.
The disease is curable if it is detected early, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus suppressing the infection and preventing cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
The aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic viral liver infections and the importance of early detection.
Does it hurt less for people who believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a calming effect that even alleviated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to see how religious belief influences human grief, reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In this unique experiment, they shocked 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists while they were all looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Using the human brain scanning technique, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
This experiment is the first in a series of research projects involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University.
The analysis was as follows: a sparkling instrument was fixed to the patient's left hand, which was then electrocuted.
Researchers asked participants to fix their eyes on two paintings - the 17th-century Sassoferrato painting of the Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century Lady of the Armour.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary's spectacle would stir up a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a calming effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in that period in four successive parts while looking at the painting of either the religious theme or the other.
Catholics claimed that looking at the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe" as "protected" persons, "reassured and peaceful in their hearts".
When they looked at the religious painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who was also involved in the experiment, thinks that with any image that shocks you can get a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find a portrait of a person they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases does change our personality", Wright added.
After these remarkable results, one question remains: What effect would it have on pain regulation if the Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of his size were shown to the faithful?
Would a high-quality vision of a Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say you are
On its tenth birthday, Google can claim: you can find it in people's pockets, as well as in the sky above their heads; you know where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who draw parallels with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to fulfill the original goals of the founders of Google: "we gather in one system all the information in the world!".
According to the Google leader, the company even after ten years of work that revolutionized the world is still in the early stages of the commitment to be able to process all information.
When asked what will happen in five years' time, Schmidt replied: "I wish Google could answer questions like 'What should I do tomorrow?' or 'What would be the best job for me?' - but software cannot answer seemingly simple questions unless there is enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their Internet browsing, the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages they went to when they finished the search are accurately stored.
For example, thanks to Personalized Search, which debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can revisit what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What if they use my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that not only do they keep, but in justifiable cases also cede to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most discussed example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over the information from its website, called Orkut, to the Brazilian government to identify pedophiles.
Instead, Internet users who care about people's rights were relieved in May when the company along with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully proved in court that they were right in their litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, by any of the constitutional clauses, to provide any kind of information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get under the pretext of enforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords from the last two months.)
So the opinion about Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their privacy is harmed by starting to use Google services, and they rebel against it as against the conservative-looking multinational companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see them as the next generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not their rival, Microsoft, who is labeled by its Windows as the conqueror of the world, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and looks more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet that has been produced by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that lists their music habits, then include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which the latest photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
We can know of numerous cases where it is clear that for example the bride, by seeing the flow of photos of the next morning of common friends, finds out who her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night with the night before or they can fire an employee of a company because he writes his honest opinion on his blog about the management of the company: one thing is for sure, the definition of privacy has been completely revalued.
A person's online life is what he shows of himself - this is the definition that lies behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to dodge Google's monopoly, can do so (starting with Scroogle, for example, which uses Google's search engine, but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who don't want to register on the social pages to avoid being found, but Google's online apps, from word processing software to image and news reading apps, can be replaced with alternative versions that don't connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
The public is almost openly waiting for the day when Google shows its true face.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten advertising agencies' revenues, while services that are being introduced more and more rapidly are causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software companies.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, top management flatly rejected the employees' protest after doubling the price of the company's daycare, deemed unlimited employee meals too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to Chinese government pressure and the company under the agreement leaked all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is ready to work, which is sure to be the predictable problems of the coming months and years that could rock the world: while some believe that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines will take on such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear its Health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it may provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, Scroogled, the popular novel by Cory Doctorow, describes in an Orwellian way that future, in which a man just from Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to wipe the tracks of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to substantiated suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the General Commissariat of Public Order of the province of Borsod.
The girls admitted to the crime they were charged with, and are currently being charged with the crime.
The two minors - reportedly two girls by the Hungarian News Agency - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
You can get up to five years in prison for complicity.
The accused in the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday .
You are charged with the crime of killing several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigation it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
Police are discussing the weapon and the circumstances of its use with an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
The 99 per cent of the shares are held by the Polish State, which intends to sell 60 per cent within a few months.
The Czech business daily E15 reported that the Polish bid was the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far bids have been made by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, declared last week that among the new owners the worst would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 per cent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 per cent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis as seen by the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second 9/11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - La Repubblica of Rome - the president has not been able to get even the support of his own party for the hastily made bill, which aims to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke of, it is more correct to speak of a "second 9/11".
According to a section of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, it was the mistake of the US political leadership that brought the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the US monetary system is growing and this will then have repercussions on the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote, the danger arises that Washington will not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored - notes the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life belts at faltering financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if, as the dominoes fall apart, more banks fall, then neither new funds nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over the fragmented financial markets.
The crisis-hit financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone, Der Standard reports, adding that there are growing concerns that European taxpayers will have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis, as did the Americans.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that is passing like a conium through the Old Continent .
The 'saviors' will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they could define: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to prevent a greater evil?
The intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What better way to develop technologies to avoid collisions than by mimicking obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the bee.
In a startling project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C-type robotic steering system for cars mimicking nature, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, RP and R&D technology director at the exhibition.
The honeybee's compound eyes play an important role in this. They can see in all directions at an angle of over 300 degrees.
To mimic the function of compound eyes, engineers used the laser-beam length-measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, at a 180-degree angle, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor which is immediately transformed into a collision avoidance maneuver.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle's robot, imitating the movements of the bumblebees, changes direction by turning the wheels as needed.
Unlike any system in existence today, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If this were not the case, the vehicle robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process must be done in a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
So instead of the endless possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the car robot the rotary motion and acceleration plus the braking.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, let alone the storage capacity.
This device only has to process a few input signals every second and react as needed.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data from the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
You don't need gigabytes of memory, or megabytes.
This is the first step in developing technology to avoid obstacles immediately, which Nissan estimates will be available in series-produced models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, dodging obstacles in his path.
This precious child has a name already
The draft law on the $700 billion bailout package is being prepared in phases to buy up the bad loans of the banks.
In the first phase, half the money will be spent.
According to Eastern Coast time during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on a financial rescue package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic US Congresswoman, stating that the agreement was only to be formalized in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: this program will work and be efficient but more measures are needed.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is, Sunday before 8 pm, Washington time (or before 2 am on Monday, Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
The bill called the 2008 economic stabilization emergency bill will be voted on Monday first by the U.S. Congress and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all 700 billion dollars to buy poor-quality credit-fund securities.
Now only half of the 700 billion dollars can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after the Congress votes, probably on Monday, out of this sum the Treasury will buy bad-rated credit-fund securities and the fate of another 100 billion dollars depends on the president's decision.
This program will be controlled by a special agency, which will also include the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion will be spent after a new decision by Congress.
According to the law the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities of credit fund securities, besides other "poisonous" type loans as well.
The purchase can be done in auctions or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial portfolio guarantees the items of concern, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
The law provides the necessary financial means, which may reach even $700 billion, to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it be the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
Instead, bank heads in trouble who are waiting for state help will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which American slang simply calls golden parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of aid given by the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the failed bank boss retires.
By directly buying the bad loans the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the bosses' compensation is not overstated.
In addition, the existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the restrictions apply only to new contracts to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that a legal limitation on the income of CEOs will be in place, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congressional Committee on Financial Services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, as they will ultimately even be able to make a profit from the transaction once the economy and the bank recover.
Under the bill, in the next five years, the president must present to Congress a proposal on how to pay back taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, there were reservations on both sides about the project.
This is not what the American people have entrusted to us, that is, they are not protecting taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were urged by the same people responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008 domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to prices last month and by 12.9 percent compared to prices in August 2007 - the Central Statistics Office (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices increased by 1,1% compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3,9% compared to the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices rose 0.7 percent from the previous month and 3.2 percent from the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only marginally by 0.1%.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors increased slightly, by 0.1 per cent compared with July.
The largest increase in price magnitude was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2,8 per cent), mainly due to the 4,6% monthly increase in bags and belts and the 2,5% increase in footwear.
The higher price level of the basic materials plastics and chemicals resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical materials production branch (1,6%).
Price decreases were recorded in the petrochemical sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9%) and - to a lesser extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1%).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing did not change.
In the rest of the processing industry, prices rose by between 0.2 and 0.9%.
The supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which are an important part of domestic trade, increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the increase in official prices from 1 July.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
The metalworking sector saw an increase of 13.2 percent, while the food, beverage and tobacco industries, which account for the bulk of the work, saw an increase of 11 percent.
Prices fell in the textile industry (2.5%) and in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3%).
In the other processors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1%.
Over the past year, prices in the global processing industry rose by 10.2 percent.
Prices for electricity, gas, heat and water were 18.7 percent higher than the previous year.
In August, the largest monthly price increase (0.7%) was recorded in the investment goods sector.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices rose by 0.3%, while prices in the energy and intermediate sectors were unchanged on the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest price increases were in the energy and intermediate industry sectors (16,8%).
The consumption goods industries declined by 6.8 per cent and the investment goods by 1.4 per cent.
The industry's export prices calculated in HUF increased by 1.1 percent compared to the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The price of our national currency in one month decreased by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungary visa waiver agreement to come into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about it in Chicago to the Hungarians living there.
In his view, 'virtually everything depends on the electronic access and control system being built on the other side of the Atlantic in time'.
He also warned that the new system will remove the entry requirement, but tourists must register before leaving their country of origin.
As of today, the Hungarian foreign minister is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, presenting her with the Medal of Honor of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with international policy advisers to presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the bank bailout.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates from the two major North American parties, on Sunday assured their support for the administration's $700 million bank bailout program, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Finance Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-style negotiations, announced early Sunday morning that they had reached a basic agreement on the bank bailout package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are more capable than their rivals of pulling the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by putting economic issues in the foreground, Obama regained some advantage and the advantage of McCain that he had gained after the convention of the Republicans with the candidacy of Sarah Palin for vice-presidency disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass legislation on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal included those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly (...) jobs, savings for you, entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are at risk", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that "we're all going to swallow this up with a heavy heart (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable path".
The Republican senator said the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the minister of fine arts and the limitation of the compensations of executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press magazine for the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious voters have become - Der Spiegel says about the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he discusses the reasons for the CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken office.
The Social-Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been anticipated for almost ten years was completed: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU won 47.7 percent, falling below 50 percent for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the province devouring its parents .
The socialists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong in the pace.However, the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the more conscious, more critical and more stubborn voters have become.
It is surprising that in recent weeks the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones that have moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, small industrialists, those with a high school diploma and those with a diploma.
Thus, the CSU's support fell to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper: "Who with whom?" - in its article entitled "The party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confused situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiation, the Greens are not yet willing to consult on the coalition.
The elections have already taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders barely let their decks show.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ chairman, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would surely not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will choose the opposition or join the coalition, these issues must be discussed without any doubt, within the ÖVP itself.
The BZÖ president, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take the responsibility of the government" - Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities opened today in Paris, hosted by France, which is also holding the Presidency of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, MEP for the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers at this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that afflict gypsy children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing foundation of their interests.
The high-level conference was opened on behalf of the French Presidency by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, the European social partners and representatives of the main European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of MEPs in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to employment discrimination, Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"Most young Roma have not finished secondary school and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible proportion can obtain a university diploma".
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The earlier a Gypsy student starts school, the more chances he has of becoming an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to a quality education and the abolition of segregated and low-level education", stressed Lívia Járóka.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU citizens who are eligible for EU funding for education and training.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer gypsy children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens", he said.
The aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting, which was held under the banner of the 'European Year for Equal Opportunities', is to provide a unique forum for promoting the elimination of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be made on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the top of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party chairman and Günther Beckstein, provincial premier, remain in office, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the critically acclaimed duo gave a hint: they don't hold on to their positions.
The aim was to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organisation, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences because of the loss of their absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career - the Socialist Christian Union reached 60.7 per cent, whereas now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they have only 43.4 per cent.
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopoly" in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the Conservatives still predominate in the southern province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, they will undoubtedly have to form a coalition with someone in the future.
As a first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was used for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly wiped off the stage the ambitious local politician.
The top leadership of the CSU is now investing all their energies in stabilizing Beckstein.
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber also who until now was moving the ropes in the background, the former head of the provincial government and former president of the CSU called September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to jointly enhance the CSU which played a pivotal role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the failure, the CSU's losses will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
This is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the welfare and stability that Alexander Lukashenko guarantees in the country, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the country's 10 million-strong legislature, made up of 110 deputies, has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDF) had hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his mandate for the fourth time after the dubious 2006 elections, would "allow" some opposition deputies into parliament this time as a result of the constitutional amendment.
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate its increasingly expensive natural gas imports from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, which owns the gas pipeline through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow Lukashenko and other high-level politicians entry because of its political regime being considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of relaxation when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on the positive phenomena rather than on the errors - such as the ban on participation imposed on one third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates were not allowed to appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
The opposition is now feeling an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is theoretically a federal state - has for a month now considered the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - declared to our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime is afraid to allow even one opposition member into this weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when they see the results, but rather try to get their message to voters about the need to make economic reforms.
- This of course causes us a lot of problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, local authorities are putting difficulties in distributing it, but even so I see that there are more and more who support change among the elderly too - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, which believes its main result is the creation of social security, is not considered adequate even by the pensioners, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country's debt and increasing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the decomposition of social security that "resembles the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich opined.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "people do not believe in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing but a testimony to the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, you have breakfast before you start work"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
But from today onwards, you start with this measure against the person who signs up and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during work hours.
This new approach was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors", says Brunetta, "are a tool for working better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services", the minister said.
"Now a new season of accountability and transparency is opening up.
This is Reformism", Brunetta stresses again.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
Masi said that "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
The general secretary said that there was no resistance from the employees: "it was a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on their part".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and half-moon.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In the case of Rome, the minister states that 'in three months sickness absences of public employees have been reduced by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people to work in one year'.
He adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
The Minister explained that the wage dynamics in the last 8-10 years have been twice as high as in the private sector and well above the inflation rate.
By now millions of public employees have joined together to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absence from work due to illness  writes the association of consumers  the people of the 'vagabond workers' is continuously increasing .
There are millions in Italy of honest and productive public servants who have united to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree".
In particular, the Tar questioned the exclusion of aggregate economic treatment for sickness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which medical checks are carried out on the sick employee, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 permanent disabilities.
By 2007, Inail data effectively confirms that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, the ANMIL is celebrating the 58th National Day for Victims of Work Accidents in all Italian provinces, which is celebrated on the second Sunday in October.
"The worrying data published by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is", says Republic President Giorgio Napolitano, in a message to the president of the Anmil, National Association of Workers with Disabilities, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the continuing association's commitment to workplace prevention, to the protection of injured workers, to assistance to the families of the victims and to raising public awareness".
"It has been a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics".
Mr Napolitano said: 'There is certainly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in schools to raise awareness more directly among young people entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is a duty to keep the attention on the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about the social gravity, to implement and improve the legislative norms.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the situation in the country.
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away the fact that the number of white deaths is equally impressive", said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'downward trend' to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that in general too little is still being done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and that the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
We believe that greater controls and inspections are necessary, but also a stronger intervention in training workers, starting from the school system".
"It is a further effort - he added - as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in relation to a phenomenon which represents a social emergency".
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
"The objective is to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - he added  so that the fate of the injured does not have to depend on the gifts provided by the legislator every time".
Mp3 players under indictment, endangering the hearing
Listening to loud music for a long time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent damage to hearing.
This is the view of the European Commission, which in a statement published in Brussels quotes the opinion of the European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSERIS), published today.
"From this scientific opinion  it appears in the footnote  that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day with the device at high volume risk permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high sound levels may unknowingly ruin their ears beyond repair", says Meglena Kuneva.
'The scientific evidence  shows that the EU is responsible - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and keep pace with new technology.'
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to look into the problem, seeing the high use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
'Scientists confirm that this is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical and related devices.'
There is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern is growing as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing noise exposure levels and time.
The European Scientific Committee considers that users of portable music devices who listen to music at high volume (over 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the currently applicable limit for maximum permissible noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
This means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives the Commission the road map for the future of the capital
It starts today, closes in March, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been installed this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commissioners will be discussing the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official cake" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas  tends to emphasize German  It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who make political decisions, the board and the municipal council, can then be endorsed.
There is no role position left, only the will to have a place to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March, when the work is finished, it will be gone, because this experiment must have a definite temporary end.
In June  the Mayor announces  we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless because its opinions are not binding, Mr Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as it was in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure it is in Rome, its contribution will be essential.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that repeatedly manifest themselves.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future".
The Commission is not a useless institution or a triviality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro and it will serve to engage and reason with the best minds of the capital".
Germanos view is that "a strategic design is needed as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a genuine leap forward, which we absolutely need, thinking with a united spirit about its future".
The future, he said, "will not be limited to the current communal boundaries but will look beyond" the future of the city and its legal status as capital, but "also considering the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He wrote an American political note that he is interested in passing off as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and established relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a Web site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big stone face: he thinks he'll win the highest office in the nation that has had two black governors and five black senators!"
These are really attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good lead.
Here too, there are those who speak with their heart but not with their brain.
An editorial in a Mississippi newspaper in the heart of the southern United States said: "Once in the voting booth, we will know for sure who the American patriot will vote for".
It's a side of the American mindset that's covered to the last man.
"Say what you want, we'll figure out where to put the cross later, whether it's Obama or McCain".
Some people swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before now, that it seems almost certain the black candidate will succeed.
Yet despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people what mistakes Bush made during his tenure, and 89 percent said Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicked in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq for most has been Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge duty to perform.
The economic collapse is also being felt by journalists in the US: it is a time of newspaper cuts.
Five hundred American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is going down the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against issue.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are breaking through the Internet, seen by many as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that "it will do something good" for journalism.
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers  i.e. the editors  and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationally are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with "job security".
The executives who think they'll lose their job in three years are 47% nationally.
For the news staff, it's 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and it becomes a take it or leave it question.
Editors are almost always well paid, while copywriters can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning gets complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to come to 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his own admission, get "sick" all the time during the year.
It's all a matter of weather.
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the measures in question.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be allowed to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being sued for bankruptcy in the scope of the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl escalation pact.
In the course of the arrest process, last week, he obtained house arrest, transforming it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence against him.
The elite in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout plan put in place by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
Yesterday's New York Times confirms that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old, moderate, East Coast soul, supportive of federal institutions and the business community, and its new, conservative soul, hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, strong especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, indeed, that has become overbearing with the vote of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake heralds: not only in the United States but in the whole West and not just here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe the crisis seems to have been working for some time as an accelerator of incubation phenomena which with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category of state and sovereignty in relation to a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balances of families living in a single country and a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and families who are also voters.
The crisis appears to be economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be largely out of the question or to have little to say: the crucial proof is that the European Union, divided as ever between different interests and different state strategies, cannot decide on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects intervention, rescue and recovery plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment you get to court it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances which no market and no organisation will probably ever be able to dispose of to the same extent.
This new emphasis on the nation-state is perfectly in line with the crisis, especially as the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the web of ever more sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to deal more and more with the less intangible things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, notice, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally absolutely bound together in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign certainly has many more cards than whoever is not, and whoever has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second news that but portends a fracture.
When you say Territory, State, Government, you inevitably say Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request for someone who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, of economic nature, was revealed inadequate with many dark areas.
And together they bring something deeper and in a disturbing sense: a discredit, a bigotry, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of Western countries in growing numbers.
It seems that in various parts of the population, the conviction is increasingly growing that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites up to now in the ascendancy, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be more alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, fuels underground a branching but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in an electoral "riot" or in the sudden changes in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and also layers with the victory of the right in Italy that have something to do).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, I would say, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent what is taking shape today are the deep layers of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially shakes in disproportionate.
In the face of all this, to speak of a 'mass revolt' today is frankly an exaggeration.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue for walking on walls
Defeat the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on walls like spider man.
It's the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come pretty close.
With a stick of only one inch [2.5 cm] square, scientists have been able to glue a 100-pound body onto a vertical wall.
THE STUDY  The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The beginning of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the gecko's paw, which is covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal's perfect grip.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the reptile's legs and at the same time "it easily detaches from the walls", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through walls exactly like spider man? Layers, yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of California, Berkeley, is also searching for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, California researchers have presented an adhesive made of hairlike micro fibers that cleans itself of dust when moving on a surface to maintain perfect adhesion at all times.
Medicines: never with fruit juice
Watch out for grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some drugs, their absorption is altered, increasing or decreasing according to the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
The risk of fresh fruit juices being packaged is associated with the use of certain medicines. David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia is sending a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice had already been under indictment for being held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines.
RISKY DRUGS  The same Italian drug agency had reported the news in a newsletter two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to be careful what they drink if they are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE OPPORTUNES  According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call from Michele Carruba, head of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan: "These findings are generally reported to the various international and national drug agencies who eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines we take and if there is something we are not clear about, do not let ourselves be impressed, ask clearly the doctor or pharmacist stressed the expert of the Ansa agency.
The Economics Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration's most vocal critics of economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, in those days when Enron was going bankrupt, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A forecast that has been highly controversial and for years was criticized by economists, but has now been shown to be accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset that the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has so quickly disappeared from public view", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a "very aggressive" publicist, particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, echo the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package
Today is the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by the volunteer developers, whose backs are watched by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the less crude review interface, are added more consistent ones, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention is also paid to multifunction with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some specific functions of some modules are interesting, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it by e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
On this front, you can always create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine typical Adobe graphics with elements from a spreadsheet or word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, they can intervene in different users, avoiding conflicts of modifications, in the preparation of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and was added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace.
And if the topic of free can be a hook for the dissemination in the homes, it is in the business field that Open Office suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to already have several projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there are also those who offer training, consultancy and assistance services which are ideal for small and mediumsized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened up.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows you to work in the database; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive. It's the fourth doping case.
New positive case in the Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third place and winner of the best climber shirt.
The news is coming from the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive Epo rider of the third generation, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those carried out in recent weeks at the laboratories at Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm he's positive, the Austrian will lose his third place at the Tour and face two years of canonical disqualification.
The news of Kohl's positive drug test for third-generation Epo is being confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he has notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has been placed on the podium behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the best climber's shirt.
Immigrants: New York Times asks, is Italy racist?
Italy has only recently become a prime destination for immigrants who are treated with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has been devoted to the debate on racism in Italy based on the case of the young man Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case illustrates what the New York Times calls the "Northern Paradox": Northern regions are both where "more integration and more work" are recorded but also where anti-immigrant sentiment is highest in the country and support for the Northern League is highest".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation that the Lega wants to tighten the brakes on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The trend is marked by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedetto XVI in the Congress has asked that the State and the Church work together to combat racism".
Students hit by high rent, up to 900 euros a room
The university rental market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study for a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain  explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani  in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to the point of triggering a process of generalized increase even for residents".
In addition, in most cases, lease offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, no-fee limit, linked sub-leases.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the market is not affected by the increase in prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, they are about 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, they earn 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University ((San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) they charge you about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The economy is only made if you change the peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in the area Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, a room costs 400-600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, a bed costs 250-350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EU nationals is more frequent, a further anomaly is recorded: a 25/30% increase in the fee to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic theaters
The historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas in a blind city, is like a face without eyes".
The image provided by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centres and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of large meticons in the outskirts and the consequent disappearance of the mono-salons in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear is almost always a historical place, full of memories, "it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom you shared a piece of space and so much emotion, had died", observes the director of the new Paradiso cinema, the film that twenty years ago won the first Oscar and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living cinema that perhaps lost forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main trade association, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, with the major payers being the cinemas in the main cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 fewer in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected by the closures are Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the multiplex is responsible for its disappearance, these three Italian regions have registered the largest number of new Métis cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
The Italian exercise has developed irrationally observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of existing ones, because when a town hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds for the merchants: the previous state debt is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
The sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year to sustain it.
Interestingly, Bologna, the first Italian city to be concerned about the closures, decided to repair itself by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the single-screen cinema both in the historic centre and in the outskirts.
The rules envisaged include tax relief measures for operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special parking fees.
I like this initiative observes Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by putting in place other measures.
True, to contrast the extra power of the meticons, traditional theaters have to improve the quality of sound and picture because the audience today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is an issue that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in via Nazionale, which are now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, to avoid seeing the posters blackened by dust, I turn the other way.
The link between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the Municipality elections for those interested in the Piromalli area".
The charges brought by the magistrates of the anti-mafia Directorate of Calabria against the intendent and vice-intendent of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the intendent of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted of criminal association mafia and to indemnify 10 million euros.
"Despite any legal and moral norms, and with good sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed to the mafia family  write the judges- to enter officially inside the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean".
The arrests this morning add to those of last July after police announced the beheading of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of Udc at the time of the dissolution, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the city council.
I call in the case the vice minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even gone so far as to ask for the variation of the project of the A3 road.
The environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, show "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families".
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come on stage.
It's an extinct field that occupies over 70% of the planet's surface and is being discovered now, by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources that big companies like Chevron are looking at.
The possibility of harvesting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, together with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was shelved, but now environmental concerns and the new rise in oil give the sector a boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated that by 2007 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by implants that exploit the movement of the sea waves.
This would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants today.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
"Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy", a spokesman for a company associated with the US oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the US continues to drill for oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to drill further.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are following the path of energy that comes from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, because marine energy has no doubt a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are many: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas connected to each other.
The force of the waves, which moves the boa up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside the boa.
The pressure makes a turbine spin, which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through underwater cables.
There are four such implants currently in development, pending federal approval, some of which could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines on the East River in New York.
The movement of water when there's a tide, it turns the turbine's blades, creating a rotational motion that powers the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Particular interest, say the Institute for Electrical Energy Development, is now due to the potential of tides.
Although intermittent, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It's mostly about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that are near the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and are planning a $35 million investment by 2009.
