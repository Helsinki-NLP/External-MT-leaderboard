This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already widely held, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists state that the skin of this animal was chestnut brown at the top and light or carotenoid-coloured at the bottom.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of the rhyoid in birds.
Because dinosaur rachis do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of rachis  barbs and barbules the researchers concluded that rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other features.
The structure of the tail suggests that it was not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or viewing. The researchers suggested that, despite this being the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult tail and not the slender, soft tail of the young.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the fur of a phallus.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters insulate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter seals the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter's list of names.
French electoral law codifies the procedures quite strictly.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process.In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with a veiled face.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with killing her son.
She is in custody pending charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be influenced by the fact that her photograph has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and courts consider the publication of portraits as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be putting themselves in danger by publishing photographs and other images of suspicious persons".
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the revelation, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine must base on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other reported topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel calls for a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave this presence for five years only.
The additional pest control test tubes had to be closely monitored by the forest rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited under the amateur sports shooting association (Sporting Shooters Association) hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly left a new seven-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods damaged by overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it had been informed of the 27 incidents related to the apparatus.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry of Finance responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no reported damages in the nation.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographer later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He was trained as a midwife and started work at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins started investigating premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if administered hormonally, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung of the infant.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' which are the flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two summers. A truly unique character. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as unusual as...maybe even more than me...I love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
From 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believes Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of those polled agree with this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the vote, 29 per cent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games relays, but his complaints raised doubts about his fitness.
He could not take the medication needed for his pain as it is forbidden by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime until January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to the earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the call as "paroles and political stupidity".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being put in and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have lasted much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's sponge, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant sponge, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes.It can be rolled into small moulds.
It can be drawn in a thin wire, which can then be twisted and rolled.
It can be made very thin, and it can be fastened to other metals.It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used for decorating hand-painted pictures in books called "colored manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes colour depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (lH in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry powders together and then, with clean, washed hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will be felt and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women would meet together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket.Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere blocks some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet long to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in ways that we can't even begin to describe.
He brought with him the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much larger prey such as insects, rodents, mice and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and which prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of cats, and live in large groups called prides.
The groups (prides) are made up of one to three related adult males, together with a maximum of thirty females and young.
Women, in general, are closely related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and sisters.
Groups of lions behave like groups of puppies or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour, and are also very fatal to their prey.
A good athlete in every way, the tiger can run (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times the strength of a healthy human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can bark loudly.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a sentence of clumsily uttered words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if possible, although almost all animals it eats are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find food (prey) by scent, holding the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move around in stealth, too.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (such as if they move over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back) they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not even be called the same species.
Species are the result of the evolutionary process, and they are the result of the evolutionary process itself.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing but other mosasauri.
Its long, narrow passage was lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as another set of roofing spikes, meaning that anyone who came its way had no chance of escape.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included shellfish, big fish, other molluscs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans did in fact have a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, peacock, buffalo, and a type of rodent-like rat that sleeps a lot.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on the benches, the rich men enjoyed a communal feast where they sat on their knees while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include the food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was considered to be the house of the deity.
People brought sacrifices to the deity and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the deity through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and, behind it, an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the goddess.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were simply open roadside stalls.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the movie "National Treasure", you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large parchment-made document (measuring 29⁄4 inch by 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added merely as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed had liberated the North of France, but the South still remained unfree.
It was run by the French "Vichy", who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the South of France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people living and working cooperatively, society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also defines the size of society.
Cities and states are the precursors of nations.Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge from several generations, a persistent cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, they were uncooperative.
He had no power to overturn the laws of taxation and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and the states took the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) and, therefore, this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago".
The origins of Taiwan go back to the early 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, begins a transformation in aboriginal wheat production practices and employs Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces take control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declare Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Much of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the most simple integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS family of formats) are equal to this aspect ratio, or very similar to it.
The much abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal frames (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has held European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common peasant.
One of the core Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether this principle was being achieved.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain was placed under a naval blockade by Germany.
The strategy proved effective, halting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, thus endangering even neutral shipping.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a future repeat of such a situation.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with pennies on his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting the different periods of time; each stage of China and each ruling family were distinctive dynasties.
There were also periods of instability between each dynasty, with provinces being divided, the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms era which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During these time periods there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China where thousands of human beings died fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on rank, army classifications were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also spurred many other people from the repressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became known as Hira on the Mount of Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, clearly shows the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
On top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if anyone knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around.Few things of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World to have survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small crypts, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' mark appears as a V and the 'down' mark as a steeple or square without a bottom.
'Up' means you start at the tip and push the lever, and 'down' means you start at the ring (the place where your hand is holding the lever) and pull the lever.
The upper strumming of a stringed instrument generates a softer sound, while the lower strumming is louder and more assertive.
You can make any mark you want with the pencils, but remember that bowing marks are there for a musical reason and so, normally, they have to be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two sons (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a violent mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a car surrounded by a crowd of angry people shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to keep their carriage windows open.
One member of the crowd beheaded the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the Queen who was in disgrace.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay the bulk of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you have to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time in which the events occurred was commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a course beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged car bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borne out by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of western Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status deteriorated during the 12th century, mostly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices that were valued above what Byzantine markets offered.
At this time the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
First, the dress was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because communication channels move slowly, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people started to use buttons to get things done.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture undertaken to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses native raised seeds for ecoregulation in conjunction with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically many farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel rejected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often indicate their membership by using a distinct and symbolic style, including mannerisms, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialisation is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not socialised by adults while growing up.
Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's serious intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are alleged to have been bred from animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When fully bred by non-human animals, the wild animal exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular animals that have taken care of it, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
The idea is to provide support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but even the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalised in the software and aims to ask, prompt, and explain procedures that might have been too challenging for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it still happens.
We consider the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which it was taken before.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach of uses and satisfactions.
For example, learning and socialization have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and ongoing relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, the facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his document 'The President's Speech', pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of a brain injury are, however, able to assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination blur the variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food (milk, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high quantity of protein containing all essential amino acids.
After all, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees living in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is the process where you deliberately wake up during your normal sleep period and go to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using relatively quiet wailing that will bring you to your senses without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you are sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, and this will force you to get out of bed to find it.
Other alternatives based on the diet involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, thus forcing the person to get up to pass urine.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of stress in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of present life.
Everyone can become enlightened.The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were enriched with the love-making spirit of mahayana and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
As a principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through the visualization of multiple gods one cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates an enlightened consciousness.
Germany was still common in World War II, and it led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war the disagreement in the system, process and culture led to the countries fighting.
Just two years after the war ended, the former allies turned into enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and it was to be fought in earnest, by alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was for it to withdraw and reorganize itself along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became almost overnight obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the frontier of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War, in which the Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to overcome Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that moved to the hills or other grazing areas, and were often attended by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly smoother roads of the time.
Crossties were introduced quite early to keep tracks in place, but gradually it was realised that tracks were more efficient if they had an iron strip at the top.
This became common practice, but iron caused more wear on cartoon wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.
The first known means of transport was walking, and humans began walking standing upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning standing man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk standing up in a habitual manner.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases.However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the source of the problems, and we should disable it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been increased by mankind's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have shell-tipped feet and pointy toes, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer parlance.
Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with the Bat, which are insects very suitable as parasites of humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are brood parasites, adapted to live in their nest or host's habitat.
Around the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the interests of their offspring, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main aim of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides much of scientific research.
However, experimentation is not alone, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations is also a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed physiological and behavioural rhythms often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic indications, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycling period of free running even without external indications.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a phage, or virus, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are microbial lineage cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts interested people to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, and visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
An example of this is to visit, take photos, and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the country's smaller towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose place of work is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is, in some way, connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has moved the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaint about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual cars and vehicles between two locations and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, the traffic flow study is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back in place along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot retract their wings are the mazzarell and the mayflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System went around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth does not feel moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at some points six miles wide.
In all, the Amazon provides 20 percent of all the water that the planet's rivers discharge into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids remained the largest in size and the best in technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their predecessors which, at the time, were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of many of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be discovered in nature in indigenous forms and it is relatively simple to mine them using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also have an alloy that contains small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them sit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the lapes was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing came into existence, the lapes was relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now write messages on computer screens, and they never have to go to the computer.
Who knows what the keyboard will become when something newer is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to nucleate many protons and neutrons.
Similarly, if you push a heavy carton onto a ladle, the splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to split with little effort.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km wide at its nearest point and 100 km wide at its farthest point.
It is thin under the sea and thick under the highlands.
There may be more moon rocks on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories are centred on finding out what makes people happy or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of attitudes can arise when managers start managing their former colleagues.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, carry out evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unknown individual who feels that he must change everything the team has done and brand it as his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often causes rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the use of the virtual teams would be in line with the principles of the e-government.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams can meet according to varying time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?One of the goals for the realisation of the learning organisation concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, an organisation's process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuous Sequencing approach as a method being used to help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition.
The correlation between the pathology of the mind and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things became separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as built in various home computer software applications and videogames.
Field trips are a big part of every class.Often, a teacher likes to take her pupils to places where there is no possibility of going by bus.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is replaced, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help to improve students' spelling.Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually leads to this situation changing.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog starts working to improve the writing so that it is not criticized.
The need to satisfy the interest of the audience inspires students to be more engaging and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students will be able to define their own positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant and bilingual capital and is home to a range of art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north are the untapped natural beauties of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what it means to be Canadian by outsiders.
Larger areas further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited natural state areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent for it when we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling say that she is married, whatever her current status with regard to marriage.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider a nuisance and it is not uncommon to be followed, hugged, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to insist on your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meronids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of geegaws, but all are tourist-oriented.
Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which covered most of the city streets, particularly the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to ascertain the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for trekking to the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the boda (motor taxi) to cycle around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short cycle.
In addition to its relative lack of accessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a sleepy city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special series Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African elements.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the North East of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the East, Zimbabwe to the North, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is regarded as the model of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, daily fees are applied for conservation and park admission.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either selections of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island (Hong Kong Island) gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The building's layout that forms the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a bar chart with a bright light due to its appearance in the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangroves in the flatlands - they include some of the last remaining stands of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer with ticks in the area.
Buses depart from the Inter-District Bus Station (along the river) during the day, although many of them, especially those heading East and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
As the inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts have small Japanese Coaster Bus services, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two arches 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical gap under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is today eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made a living by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounter with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and games may also appear here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley next to the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although it is possible that the UK and US currency will be accepted; we spoke to the owners in advance to see what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to change the Falklands currency outside the islands, so change the money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals still live in the wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
As docile as they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the right distance. e animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they lose their space.
However, be aware that the odours attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odours and keep the countryside clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-nineteenth century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the main Tupua leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, as Auckland lies between two harbours.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour district) covers the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all are sheltered by sand with a safe swimming area, and the majority have the shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located within the Port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sandy beaches for the family that are occasionally filled and have a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines probably travel better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of coffee being called flat white is unfamiliar. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is filled with lots of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is by Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but it's excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round, and accidents due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, you should take advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to security messages.
The box jellyfish is found along the beaches and along the estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Although sharks do exist, they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport and even flight-hotel combined packages.
They can also reserve the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any amendment or request for a change must be passed on to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival goers decide to camp on-site, and many consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close you have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be sections of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, take a good look at the cabin, as the sound of passing through the ice is horrible for those most affected.
The cruises in Saint Petersburg include time in the city.The cruise passengers are exempted from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximise the time and money spent by guests.There are generally no windows and clocks and it can be difficult to find the exit points.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers, to keep the guests in good spirits, and to keep them on the spot.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who will be driving at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with snow and ice, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on dry asphalt.
During heavy snowstorms, you may get enough snow to get you wet in a short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow fall or snowmelt or by condensation or snow on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in most countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focal point for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to the on-land journey for observing the wild and wonderful African animals, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move towards cars and near standard equipment that allows good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes seen in the wild and are best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "footing") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March many coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and typical tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
The walkway on wet clothing can help them dry.Many hotels have a walkway and a board to walk on available to use, even if you do not have one in the room.
If a walk-in dryer is not available, or if you do not want to wear long-sleeved socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Care should be taken not to let the fabric become too hot (which could cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, if you let the water for a minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travellers may encounter furry animals that they are not familiar with in the regions where they are staying.
Pests can poison food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, give poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, do not generally qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, as it passes often through isolated backwoods passes.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep hills, narrow seats and sharp turns are prevalent.
The maximum speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict compliance with them is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, mobile service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastas are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, and cooked apples are used in the pies all year round, and chickpeas and turnips start in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts, jelly, and other tree nuts.
If you want small but rich pastas, try the ones called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a spice-based dish, along with meat or vegetables.
The cask may be 'dry' or 'wet' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers the great variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of simple savory dishes, and the predominant flavourings favourite of the Javanese are carrots, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese Indian coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The poles are support for the rider's feet which cross each side of the railing.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues due to the potential for the rider to fall into them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he may be caught if the horse runs away.
Firstly, most of the riders wear riding boots with heels and a flat, rather narrow chest.
Subsequently, some exits, particularly British exits, have safety bars that allow the staff skin strip to be detached from the rail if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley (Wied Cochamó) - The main destination for Chilean fishing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with several large walls of granite and rock.
The highest points include spectacular views from the summits.Springboarders from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes amidst its endless potential for climbing.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving downhill skiing on snow-covered ground on skis or snowboards attached to feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many amateurs, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning whole holidays around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  the cave paintings showing skiers go back as far as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking with skiing: This activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but generally does not involve, ski touring or alpine-style mountain climbing, the latter of which is done on a standing foot and requires much harder skis and boots.
Consider the skiing route as a similar hauling route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking, but it is only very rarely that you will have the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries.Typically, to travel through several countries you have to pass visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you remain in this area, you will generally be able to cross the border without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture around trade is also important for many people who have other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and had reindeer mainly as heavy-lift animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern trades.Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although used extensively, especially among non-Romani, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also consider consulting the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory report is a concise summary of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are often too quick, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
The term 'severe weather' is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rain, and fires in uncultivated areas are types and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, windstorms, sea storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include severe snowstorms, hailstorms, snowstorms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Any organiser of a visit to a country which could be considered a war zone must undertake vocational training.
Searching the Internet for a Hostile environment course probably posted an address for a local company.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Courses are usually 2-5 days and involve role play, many first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but there are not many publications on war zones.
Travellers planning surgery for sexual reassignment abroad should ensure they are carrying valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies equally widely.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow of a wave that breaks off from a bay, often in a trough or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and may form a fast current to the deep water there.
Many deaths occur from fatigue after attempting to swim backwards against the current, which may be impossible.
Once the current is out, it is no more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be caught again or, depending on your skills and if you have been spotted, you may prefer to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock precedes culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and may be more intense.
Travellers who find it easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your cultural habits.
When you arrive, people may at first be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country will need to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also required for travellers returning home.
The sound and light display of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the stillness before the show starts.
The sound and light story is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with six active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.The largest is King George Island with the colonization of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the still active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost region of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula mountains here join the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, scattered in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern or central part of Sentinel has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its summit reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you must be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need to communicate remotely with voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option among those planning a year-long break from studying is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, and allows them to take a year off before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during an interval year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education back home.
Typically there will be a tuition fee to register for these educational programmes.
Finland is a great sailing destination.The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need to go to the sea.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the distinguished cruises in the Baltic include an extended visit to St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, returning at night and sleeping on the ship.
If you only leave the country by using onboard excursions you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in the leaflets.As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never been on a plane before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions that many people have for other things.
For some, a little understanding of how airplanes work and flying can help them overcome fear based on the unknown or things they have no control over.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly.Often, time is very important in the case of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If you have sent the goods by air, some routes may take days to clear for customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to come up with a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This is not cheap, however: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economic zero for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
In general, it does not make sense to look for discounts for business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain important group of air travellers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge for these things.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and bustling business center, built around a huge beach and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red-tiled houses, the 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more European Mediterranean atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
At the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain graves.
You will not regret spending half an hour strolling around the intriguing village.
Towards the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron's boastful description of its great beauty.
The Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, in the North, visit the large Sanctuary of the Madonna of Fatima (Kappella), a place of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember that, in essence, you are visiting a site of mass significance, as well as a site of almost incalculable meaning to a significant portion of the world's population.
Many men and women are still alive today who have managed to survive here for so long, and many more have had their loved ones slaughtered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.Between them, half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most of the people understand it, and almost everyone can practically speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used extensively in public transport and other facilities.
Regular alerts in the Metro are made in Catalan only, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, cold, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to camp in Paris is to behave like a good boy, and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred).
The unfriendly attitudes of the Parisians soon fade away when they are shown basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes nature park is covered with many trees, mainly beech, spruce and spruce, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude.
The reception area also contains an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, rooster, lynx, wildcat and wild boar can be found there, along with many more common species
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear veils that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Many of the monasteries provide unprepared women's shawls, but if you bring your own, especially one with a colorful hood, you will receive a smile from the priest or from the nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear neckties that cover the knees.
This can also be seen from the stock in the entrance but those clothes are not washed after every person has worn them and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these shirts.For men there is a one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in each plate.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and available condiments such as cheese, tuna oil, etc.
All nouns, next to the word you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
This certainly facilitates reading, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on which vowel follows them.
Similarly, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means car, while carro means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain as museums, or educational venues.
As light pollution at their best was not the kind of problem we have now, they are usually located in towns or on campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom display, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the daffodil was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom fests were hosted by the emperor for him and other members of the aristocracy only around the Imperial Court.
Plants are at their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even a "single" sample.
If you visit a garden organised formally, the collection of "samples" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But when placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will need to face both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good subject for a vacation.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine valley or cruise to interesting towns on the Danube or cruise the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of popular paths for long walks and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
It is the tradition to spend the Easter evening in an exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands were brought here by swimming, grazing or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey and so the giant ferret became the main grazing animal within the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs have been introduced.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be fairly dark all the time.
As the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard work clothes, and colleagues call each other by nicknames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the emphasis being on group effort rather than encouraging individual achievement.
Workers often want to obtain the approval of their superiors for any decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions unreservedly.
