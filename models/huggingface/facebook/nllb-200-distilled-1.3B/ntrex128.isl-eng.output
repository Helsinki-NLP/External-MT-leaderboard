Welsh councillors are worried about looking like a bat
Some ministers are concerned about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns have been raised by a proposal to change the name of the Council to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament from all parties are concerned that it could make them laughable.
One Labour councillor said his party was worried that it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means crazy and pwp means sour.
A Plaid Cymru councillor said the party as a whole was "dissatisfied" and had made other suggestions.
A councillor from the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open minded" about the name change, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to u in Icelandic.
The Council, which is currently working on a legislative proposal to propose the name changes, said: The final decision on all names applied to Council members will of course be up to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the council published the results of a public opinion poll showing strong support for calling the council the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of councillors, the council chose the WMP (Welsh Parliament members), but the MWP received the most public support in the polls.
Council members are reportedly now making other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for Council Chair Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform programme will also include other changes to the way the Council operates, including rules on the withdrawal of councillors and the organisation of the committee structure.
MEPs will be able to vote on their title when the debate on the Bill begins.
Macedonians vote in name change election
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country in Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was held in an effort to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbors equals a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed their applications to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said he will not consider the election valid.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said, however, that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bell sounds churches in Harlem are in trouble
"The elderly people I spoke to said that before, you could find a bar and a church on every street corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, neither is found there.
He said that it was understandable that the burden would decrease.
"People have other ways of meeting" nowadays, he said.
Bars are no longer the center of the neighborhood where people gather regularly.
As for the churches, he worries that the money raised from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect and that sooner or later they will be back on track.
He added that churches might be replaced by apartment buildings that are full of people who will not help save the neighborhood's remaining shelters.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, he said,  and will therefore accelerate the closure of these churches for good, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a center for blacks - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation broke up in the 1940's.
A congregation of the Witnesses who had been working in the area took over the building.
A congregation of Twelvers took over St. Martin's Church, led by Sir John Howard Johnson, who had taken the initiative to blackmail shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who insisted on hiring or giving them promotions.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but members of Mr. Johnson's congregation made plans to rebuild it and also had the clock made.
Sir David Johnson, son and successor of Sir Johnson, called the clock the proud "Clock of the Poor People".
The expert who played the clock in July called it another name: Cultural Treasure and Unique Historical Instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell ringing in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved on to a larger bell ringing at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not gotten anyone else in his place.
In recent months, numerous architects and builders have made their way to St. Martin's, some hired by church leaders and others by the diocese.
The church council - which oversees the parish and is made up of church leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese might be trying to pass on the costs to the church council, even though it had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy who was scavenging for lobster in California
According to authorities, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while digging for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been digging for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then crossed with a group of others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a thrill of catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
All his bones were torn apart", Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains critically injured.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Coast Guard Chief Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained severe upper-body injuries.
Authorities closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security reasons.
Giles said that over 135 different species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's with plans to take over the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's intends to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a supermarket-style beauty shop and a dedicated support staff.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which is growing while sales of fashion and home goods are declining.The larger cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out in more stores next year if successful.
Cosmetic investments are part of a way for supermarkets to use shelf space that was previously used for telescopes, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it plans to double its cosmetics range to 3,000 products, including brands on board with Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given additional space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store also plans to resume sales of its boutique beauty range, with the majority of products vegan-friendly, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test the availability of two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon in south London last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the increasing tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily from local shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores would be increasingly similar to shopping malls as the chain tries to compete with the low-cost grocery stores Aldi and Lidl with more service and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has installed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since the two chains were bought two years ago, which they say has increased sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The store's previous attempt to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical divisions was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried a partnership with Boots around 2000, but it ended due to a dispute over how the proceeds from the sale of the drug in the supermarkets should be shared.
The new policy follows the sale of Sainsbury's's 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds pharmacies, for £125 million three years ago.
Under the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a large selection of luxury leather goods, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the look of our beauty stores to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be in hand for consultation.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the pleasant surroundings and convenient locations make us an exciting beauty store that transforms old shopping habits.
Peter Jones is out of the game after Holly Willoughby signs a £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, has become a "star" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby terminated an £11 million contract with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-grown and accessory brand, Truly.
The company had been likened to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark.
Willoughby, 37, host of This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den, with a sore throat by leaving a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on exciting new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was in the middle of a tough meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the popular TV personality admitted she didn't have enough time for the home goods and accessories brand Truly due to new deals worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was intended to double Willoughby's assets, but their estimated value is £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was retiring from Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source said: "Truly was Holly's longest priority.
This was to be her future job, which would provide her with income for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was completely unknown to everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went on sale.
There's a full stockpile of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters ready to go on sale.
Experts believe that the failure of the This Morning ad, which features one of Britain's most popular stars, could cost the company millions in heavy product investments, from pillows and candles to clothing and home goods, and potentially further damage sales.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends with Jones and his wife, Tora Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin, a television production company.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV series I'm a Celebrity.
A close confidant of Jones' said last night: "We don't want to say anything about his business dealings".
Tough conversation and then we fell in love
He was facing criticism from the media for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for a president, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader's garden.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump, and he was roaring for the reporter's voice.
I haven't left anything behind.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
However, talks on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's top envoy, told international leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received an "adequate response" from the United States to North Korea's first steps toward nuclear disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States kept up the trade to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his speech.
"We have a very close relationship with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of lives would have been lost.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - the missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the remains of American troops had been returned home.
He also criticized his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into the crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause widespread damage on an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's inhabitants were forced to flee their homes, no emergency was declared, but that is the prerequisite for international relief efforts.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they will not seek international assistance, so this is difficult, said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear when foreign aid workers will be able to start working in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country's disaster management agency, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international aid should be allowed to assist in relief efforts.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly ill-prepared to withstand them.
Flood defenses have been built in Aceh, but they are a rare sight on other coastlines.
So it seems that the number of deaths from floodwaters in Palu has continued to rise, even after the warning was issued.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more difficult.
An ambulance that has been docked in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site.
President Joko Widodo made the restoration of Indonesia's dilapidated highways a major campaign goal and has invested heavily in roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr Joko's government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with persistent interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim-majority have embraced a more conservative religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with swords, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equalises against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was sent off by Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal. His team was down 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to hit the goal towards the goalpost.
The ball flew high over the goal and toward its right corner.
The ball finally passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
"I just wanted to try to get in that position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and touch it once and didn't think too much about it, just took the shot.
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the attack, the Chelsea striker passed the ball with a header to Mateo Kovacic and then bounced from the centre into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic was running the ball fast in the middle.
Then he passed the ball beautifully and sent Hazard in for a wickets.
Hazard evaded the defenders and scored from the corner with a left-footed shot to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Premier League semi-finals at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after floods in Indonesia
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization, told a news conference that several people were buried when buildings collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake, which caused waves up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O'Hagan, the investigator, said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have caught something on their cameras to contact us, because they might have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside an apartment.
This afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are working to notify the victim's next of kin.
A train driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours may pass before they can reenter.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area now appears to be a crime scene.
A weeping woman came on the scene.
She keeps saying, "This is so horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the marked police area and one car was just outside.
A number of police officers were stationed inside the marked area, monitoring the residential buildings.
Anyone who may have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Hotline anonymously on 0800 555 111 and provide the number 247 as of September 30.
The British Parliament statue of Cromwell is the latest monument to be accused of rewriting history
Banning the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of his ultra-orthodox Puritan followers in so many of England's cultural and religious centres.
The Cromwell Society, however, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was "fascist" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be the subject of a battle.
The end of the English Civil War against the cultural order was neither an order nor an act of Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistakes would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The glittering statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a symbol of the spirit of the 19th century and is part of a story that many still consider worthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to have been the protector of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this description is entirely accurate remains a matter of much historical debate.
However, it is certain that the conflicts of the mid-17th century have shaped the course of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known figure who represents one side of those conflicts.
His achievements as a protector of the state are worthy of our praise and remembrance.
A pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him
A pig attacked and killed a Chinese farmer at a market in southwestern China, according to local reports.
The man, whose only surname is Yuan, was found dead with a rotting corpse and covered in blood near a flea market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning, the uncle found him dead and found the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He said that inside the passageway was a large pit with a bloody mouth.
A court investigation confirmed that the 250-pound log had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's legs were bloody and bruised", said the uncle, surnamed Wu, to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The owner of the market told the Evening News that the pig had been locked inside to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market's owners are in talks to compensate for his death.
There are recorded cases of pig attacks on humans, although these are rare.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig in their home in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had been trapped by a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife had ejected the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that bloodshed can trigger aggression in them.
They're just playing.
They like to play and they're curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the respect they deserve", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it passes over a cooler bay off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa became a Category 1 hurricane with winds of up to 86 miles per hour [136 km/ hr] at 5 a.m. eastern standard time on Sunday, and was located about 370 miles [600 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is scheduled to head north on Sunday.
At the same time, it is forming across the Pacific Ocean and will move eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa reaches the Baja California Desert on Monday as a tropical storm, it will be followed by a large tropical storm moving northward into the southwestern United States.
Rose will be accompanied by up to 10 inches of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical storm will mix with the approaching low, forming a large and widespread precipitation over the southwest over the next few days.
Local precipitation of 2.5 to 10 cm can cause dangerous flash floods, soil movement and possible desert erosion.
A major tropical storm will cause up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The possibility of flash floods with rapidly worsening conditions is due to the distribution of tropical rainfall.
People are strongly advised against going out into the desert on foot when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn a glacier into a raging river, and thunderstorms can bring hailstorms and dust storms.
The approaching storm will bring localized discharge to certain areas along the coastline of Southern California.
There's a chance of about an inch of debris that could cause slight movement of the soil and a bump on the road.
This is the region's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical storms will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before precipitation spreads over larger areas late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across four states on Tuesday and end on Wednesday.
Expect large temperature changes throughout the United States in October as the Arctic cools, but the temperature belt prefers to remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this can cause large temperature swings over short distances.
Consider a striking example of a heat wave in the central United States on Sunday.
There's almost a seven-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer clouds will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures of about 85 degrees Fahrenheit [25°C] or higher from the lowlands in the south to the northeastern United States.
New York City could hit a high of 85 degrees on Tuesday, about 40 degrees Fahrenheit [65°C], above the national average.
Our long-term forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in early October.
Over 20 million people watched the interview of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1990s.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, and television stations paused their regular schedule to report the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, proposed a bill that would allow the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was certain Kavanaugh had drunkenly attacked her and tried to undress her at a school party.
In an emotional statement, Kavanaugh said he was certain that it had not happened.
More people likely watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported watching on Friday.
The company recommended viewership on the television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other television stations that broadcast the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has trouble measuring people's opinions in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the most viewers of the day's interviews were Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest continued to be high after the trial.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After the office of this Republican congressman announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameramen obtained footage of him being shouted at by protesters on Friday morning as he tried to enter the elevator to attend a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes as shame rained down on him on CNN.
A woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you".
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
The crowd said to him, "You have a kingdom, and many women are giving birth".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would rather speak at the committee meeting.
The cable and cable networks were all live later in the day as the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominee next week, but a Democratic minority has urged it.
Flake was partially convinced after a conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, a Democratic senator.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators after that.
Flake's vote was a turning point, because it was clear that the Republicans didn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has authorized an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
May, UK Prime Minister, accuses critics of being "in the political game" over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" on Britain's future and putting its interests ahead.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attends the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published alongside her cover interview, Boris Johnson, her former foreign secretary, condemned the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said the proposal that Britain and the EU should levy tariffs on each other was "totally reckless".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU's star quarterback.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
Authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, saying that Sims lost his glasses in the shootout.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's genetic material on them, according to WAFB, CBS' sister network.
Police say Simpson has admitted in police custody to shooting and beating Wayde.
According to his lawyer, a $350,000 insurance policy was in place.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's office issued an emergency report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and down the neck.
Authorities would like to thank the Louisiana State Police, the Crime Stoppers, the Southern University Police Department and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU athletic director, thanked law enforcement for their "effort and dedication to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played baseball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "shocked and devastated" by Wayde's passing.
"It's something you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcanoes spewing ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexican cities on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it became more active, with 183 cases of gas and ash being recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was watching the tremors and tremors from the volcano.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in clash with Catalan separatists just before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands took part in a protest marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence vote.
A group of masked separatists sprayed eggs at the riot police and threw powder paint that formed a dark haze of dust on the streets, which were usually crowded with tourists.
Attacks also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to keep the pressure in check.
Groups of separatists chanted: "We will not forget and we will not forgive" for several hours while their opponents shouted back: "Long live Spain".
Fourteen needed to be hospitalized for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the autonomous region a year after the referendum on October 1 was declared illegal by Madrid authorities, but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but turnout was low as most of those who were against separation ignored the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed last year when police attempted to stop the vote at polling stations across the region, but clashes ensued.
Groups of independents had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the country's police.
The opposition continued but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, joined the secessionist protests with his wife and said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's independence.
Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to get married, but now we're fasting", he said.
Despite a necessary but narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalonia's independence parties have struggled to keep their composure this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in voluntary exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the vote and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police rally on his phone, said politicians from both states had called for the dispute.
"The tension is rising", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backwardness of democratic values and the repression we have seen the Spanish government apply, he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car was driven into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after driving into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7.30pm UK time.
Bob Blemmings, the investigator, said that the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It's also possible that the shot was fired from a crossbow in the direction of the vehicle.
Menga scores in a 1-0 win for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal guaranteed Livingston the win
Livingston's team, who had been relegated from the lower division, entered Rangers on a free transfer and Steven Gerrard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Mark Dolly Menga scored the goal and Gary Holt's team is now second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have yet to win a Premier League outright this season and face Hearts, who are eight points clear of the top-flight, next Sunday.
For that game, the Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and Holt's head coach has yet to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities with uninvited guests
Holt's team should have been over long before they scored, but their leg-splitting caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot past after running through the defence to receive a shallow pass from Graig Halkett across the net.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them in peace, knowing that they could cause trouble for the visitors in the right places.
And that's how the big goal was scored.
Rangers took on additional demand and Livingston worked to create market opportunities. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly assisted Menga, who took the pass and scored from the centre of the wicket.
At that point, the Rangers had the ball, but the home team's defense was unassailable and Liam Kelly, the goalie, didn't have to put in a lot of effort.
And so it went into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot from the net after a shot from Livingston.
Questions were continually brought to Livingston's whip but were dismissed, and two requests for a whip - for Halkett's defense against deputy Glenn Middleton, and one for a hand - were dismissed.
Livingston's clear - the analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at the Tony Macaroni Theatre
A brilliant performance and a result for Livingston.
For the average person, they stood out and continued to exceed all expectations in their upbringing.
Their style of play and teammates have hardly changed since their return to the top flight, but Holt deserves much praise for having pulled the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the quarterback, was incredibly good and led a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes the entire time.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they've been under Gerrard, they've far exceeded expectations.
They were having a hard time finishing their run and only managed to open the home court once, so this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
It was a bright and smiling Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the two NATO nations.
The two countries have been at odds over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey itself.
Police used security measures to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also spoke out, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The two opposing groups reflect the controversial nature of this visitor, who is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Deptford crash: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped and the paramedics provided medical assistance, but the man died at the scene.
The accident came months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
Police said they were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
The road has been closed and buses are being diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured when rioters broke into a maximum-security men's prison, according to a prison officials report.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9.30am local time on Sunday and are still raging.
Tornado Special Forces have been called to the area to try to contain the riots, which have left eight inmates injured and confined to one cell.
The guards were relieved of their duties due to minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Department of Corrections said: "Specially trained prison guards have been called in to handle an ongoing case at Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees have been discharged for injuries.
There is no violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can expect to spend even more time behind bars.
Long Lartin Prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden had been hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, riot police were called to the scene to deal with a serious breach of the peace, where workers were attacked with billiard balls.
Tropical Storm Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical storms are rare in Arizona, but they are likely to hit early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rose sweep across the southwest, threatening flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is scheduled to make a direct run across Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with a drop.
The Phoenix Weather Bureau said on Twitter that only 20 tornadoes have maintained their strength to qualify as tropical storms or hurricanes within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center predicts 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with some up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest are likely to see 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, including the central Rocky Mountains and The Great Basin, with the possibility of single precipitation of up to 10 cm.
For those not at risk of flash flooding, Rosa's experience could be a blessing because of the severe drought in the area.
While floods can cause great damage, some of this precipitation will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Drought, at least 40 percent of Arizona is in extreme drought, the second-highest category, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall in the Baja California Desert in Mexico.
Rosa, still classified as a hurricane Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 86 miles per hour, is located 400 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm moves across the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, diminishing its strength.
So it is expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or Monday night.
High rainfall is possible in some parts of Mexico, with significant risk of flooding.
"Somewhere between two and six inches of rain are expected in Baja California and into northwestern Sonora, with a chance of up to eight inches", weather.com said in a statement.
Rose will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, then continue through Arizona and reach southern Utah late Tuesday.
"The worst-case risk of a Rose or its remnants is extreme precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern United States Desert Region", said the National Hurricane Center.
The resulting drought is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the deserts and mountain ranges.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 0400 hours British time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area at midnight, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
Police have asked witnesses who may have phone records of what happened to turn themselves in.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has been embittered and angered" by the Democratic Party
"A vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the ruthless and vile practices of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally of supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has been subjected to the anger and resentment" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently denying claims by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the Republicans had seen Kavanaugh's brilliance and humanity and courage the day before.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most brilliant lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a glorious career as a public servant", he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a direct reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters participating in the midterm elections.
It's five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not proposing, but I'm really doing it, he said.
That's why I go to great lengths to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats were working to "defeat and obstruct".
The first key vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is set to take place no later than Friday, according to an aide to the Republican leadership in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the death toll is likely to rise
At least 384 people died and many were washed away as huge waves washed up on the coast as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high swept the beach at sunset, washing a crowd of people out to sea and destroying everything in sight.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami formed yesterday, people were still on the coast and did not flee immediately, so it killed people", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The wave didn't come alone, it took cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the wave had travelled across the open sea at 500 miles per hour before hitting the coast.
Some climbed trees to escape the floodwaters and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and unused bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes affected an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Food and Technology Administration said in a statement that the tornado that released a large earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow creek, may have increased the size of the tidal wave, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "substantial" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death toll and property damage could be higher along the coastline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communication is down and no information is coming from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", the Red Cross said.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though officials said that the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, a man was heard shouting from the top floor of a building to warn people on the street below that a flood was approaching.
Just minutes later, the tidal wave washes up on the coast, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that cut off communication and made it difficult for authorities to organize relief efforts.
The army has begun sending aid by air from Jakarta and other cities, officials say, but people who have been helped by the area are still in dire need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport has only recently reopened for relief work and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, the president is going to visit a refugee camp in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from a tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision workers from Donggala have made it safely to the city of Palu, where they are seeking shelter in tents set up in the park outside their offices.
"People said they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
It's very bad.
Relief groups have begun the difficult relief work, but some have complained that highly skilled foreign workers are being discouraged from traveling to the island.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies, and personnel can only begin to arrive if the disaster area is declared a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
It is still a local disaster area, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared this a disaster area, we can open up to foreign aid, but no announcement has come yet.
As the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the still missing man held out hope that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous stories that cast hope on the dismal predictions that accompany natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a raft.
On Sunday, aid workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian volleyball team, had been the coach of two now missing volleyball players for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others locked inside the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a man with years of experience in this field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that hours after news broke inside the simulator team that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent a WhatsApp message of despair to the contestants staying in Palu and participating in the beach party.
However, his message showed only gray, not blue, marks.
"I think it means the messages were not received", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from a fast-food joint in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee filling up a Newport Express Bank on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport Police.
The driver of the car had been using a speed bump at the amusement park and was filling it with more cash, said police officer Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was at work, another man ran from behind and stole a purse that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the report, but police did not disclose how many were involved.
Anyone with information about the suspects is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: Veran formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Arianna Grande on the show, but she left for "emotional reasons", the show's producer said.
West has previously said that this name has religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortened form of his current name.
"I think ye (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm me, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- just being a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former partner, has also written his name with and without a ribbon and a hat.
The president-elect of Mexico is called not to use the military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the new president of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country commemorates the 50th anniversary of the bloody student uprising.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador vowed to never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest in the square, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were sweeping across Romani America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly stipend and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of academic skills are driving youths into crime.
The United States should double its investment in artificial intelligence.
With China's increasingly active use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, says inventor and AI researcher Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The recommendations were made after various U.S. government departments issued announcements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal comprehensive plan for artificial intelligence.
However, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
It would be a good start to double the amount of money spent on AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we look forward to seeing the next big breakthrough in AI, Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
He worked on artificial intelligence systems in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, won Best Actor in America for Othello, and later was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese division.
Lee spoke about previous technology competitions, which were held by the US government, such as the Department of Defense's robotics competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to see what the next initiatives would be.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
It is not China that is the main target, but the companies, Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its AI research.
I think that those with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically get a residence permit, he said.
The Chinese National Assembly released its Future of Artificial Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
The Natural Sciences Institute of China provides funding for people working in universities, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will work with both industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation designed to create a safety council for artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, and it claims that the name of its northern neighbors is tantamount to a claim to their territory and therefore denies them membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the identity of Macedonia's majority population of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that the turnout will reach the minimum 50 percent required for the vote to count.
The question on the ballot paper is: Do you want to join NATO and the EU by agreeing to the deal with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a fair price for Macedonia to join alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While the result is not legally binding, many lawmakers have said they will follow it and enact it.
The name change would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate.
The Election Commission said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe, said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on whether to change the country's name, which would pave its way into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, worked to prepare a small stage and set up benches in front of tents erected by those who would ignore the vote.
We are committed to NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the service doors, said Kavardarkov.
We are a poor country, but we live with dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to something else like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed funds to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
I believe that the vast majority will agree that over 80 per cent of the country's citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said that acceptance would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that is below the minimum required.
Another poll by Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would say yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not passed, it could be the first serious blow to the government's policy toward the West since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all the defenses of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were lightly behind Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the attack.
He blew past three Brighton defenders and then went out into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He passed one defender and then passed several more just outside the Brighton winning area.
Then he turned left and found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch inside the wicket to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play on Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the field.
"Aguero is in some kind of foot trouble", said Pep Guardiola, City manager, to reporters.
We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues their first goal of the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a shot at the Brighton goal in that attack.
He sent a magnificent long ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball a few times and then sent Sterling towards the goal line.
City's striker sent the ball into the net just before he went out.
City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a playoff game against the Rockies.
With the Nationals being shut out of the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to push for a second start.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a shot at the playoffs, as they are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Conference.
The Rockies earned at least a wildcard spot with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still looking to win their first division title.
Even if we play for free, at least we can play for the electrifying atmosphere of Denver, as well as the team we're sure to meet after playing their best game of the year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in a situation like this?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the starting pitcher in Sunday's game, but it's believed they'll let Scherzer pitch under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start his 34th game, took the practice roster on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his day off.
This right-handed pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to visit West Virginia
The president was indirectly referring to the issue surrounding Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters participating in the midterm elections.
Everything is in the bag in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are some of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running anyway, which is why I'm going to the polls to fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, radical bunch of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the cruel, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them.
He said that the Democrats were working to "dismantle and inhibit".
And it's been seen for the last four days, he said, and he said Democrats are angry and mean and cruel and untruthful.
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was met with a roar from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who locked the file?
What?
No, look, no, I was waiting for one... it was a really bad physical, the worst I've ever seen.
The working class is no longer a conservative church.
He Does Not tolerate the Expressing of His Thoughts
When the Momentum movement in my party chose to give me a recommendation, it hardly came as a surprise.
I am, after all, the last of many Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome, just for expressing our views.
My congresswoman, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was a fierce opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the proposal to give me a recommendation came about because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having responsibility for economic policy, for national security, for Europe, for Chaldean-like issues that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders about.
The announcement for the Nottingham East meeting on Friday said that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
In my eight years as a Labour MP, Friday meetings have long been just that.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "better and milder" governance has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that there is no difference of opinion in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged on whether the party leaders find them acceptable.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues, who I thought had similar political views to me before, began to expect me to take a radical turn and support views that I would never have previously agreed with, whether on national security or the EU Common Market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it makes little difference what I say - I am followed by a barrage of insults on social media calling for my break-up, denying centralism and telling me I should not be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those who have to endure the ravages of sexual or prejudicial abuse every day but never stop.
One of the most frustrating things about this political era is how much assault and abuse has become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should embrace a more tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a conservative church, and with every vote of no confidence or change in the electoral code, the party gets narrower.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years about not being too heavy, not being too light, and then I'd be fine.
But I chose not to get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, spurred on by the Thatcher government's negligence that left my schoolroom in disrepair, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, whether I was on the city council or in parliament.
I've never hidden my political views, not even from the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I just want to say that as the country heads for Brexit, which will damage our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to devote my time and energy to loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my only message, which I would like to send, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threat of outrage or political disruption will deter me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr team to the top
Two late touchdowns could have made a difference in the final score, but there is no doubt Ayr had a clear victory in today's fast-paced game in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the list and the only team out of 10 that's still undefeated.
In the end, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the home team more successful and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
We have had tough opposition in our games so far and are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "They deserve credit, they took their chances better than we did".
Mark Grant Anderson crossed Ayr in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo returned the ball, but a yellow card on the Scottish striker, who was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo extended Ayr's lead by a wide before he scored with a kick just before halftime and then a touchdown to give Ayr a 17-5 lead in the second half.
But Melrose opened the second half with a touchdown from Patrick Anderson, after Baggot returned the ball, narrowing the field to five points.
Gera then needed a long break to deal with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to retire, and Ayr then extended his lead with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo returned the ball.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's captain, was then awarded the yellow card and Melrose again used a man-over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-fought attack.
However, the home side came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson was given the yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's goal, after extra time.
Climo returned to the attack, as he did again just after the restart, after Kyle Rowe managed to kick David Armstrong from the wicket and send it to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown.
The star of the show Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, star of the show Still Game, seems ready to move into the restaurant business after it emerged he's been hired as the CEO of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which he writes and stars in alongside his old show business partner, Creg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it appears Kiernan has plans for Craiglang's life.
According to public records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source with the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the "living restaurant industry" of Glasgow.
The ocean is ours: Landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen access to Pacific Ocean
There are guards at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly blue flags.
Naval stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.
Yet, for all the rest of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline, lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict, is still fresh in mind - along with the desire to sail across the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Criminal Court in The Hague on October 1 after five years of litigation.
Bolivia is full of strength, unity and integrity, and of course awaits the verdict with a positive mind, said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's demand that Chile be obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea after decades of difficult negotiations.
Monday's ruling is also very important for Evo Morales, the country's Indian-born president who will be in contentious competition for re-election next year.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific, he promised in late August.
However, some commentators feel that the court's ruling in favor of Bolivia is unlikely to make much difference if it did.
The court, which is based in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction to grant land to Chile and has ruled that the ruling will not affect the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the court's ruling comes just six months after the final hearings suggest that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Sárate, a Syrian expert on international law.
It is also possible that the past four years have not been a matter of progress for Bolivia, but of regression.
"The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea", said Zarate.
Morales' military propaganda has drained Chile of all goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will have talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and the country's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to open a new relationship with Chile and to end a 139-year-old dispute, to the benefit of both countries, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Romani America, was using the issue as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to make amends with the past.
North Korea says it won't give up its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, says the country will never lay down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri made his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow through on the commitments it made at a meeting of world leaders in Singapore.
His recommendation comes as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "dream" to think that the continued US trade embargo and opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever crush North Korea.
Washington will not accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes concrete steps to disarm its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are serious doubts that Pyongyang is serious about disarming what it likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Show presents the latest line of large headwear that will be coming to fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely exposed to the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased a variety of oversized, curly hats for their SS19 line at the Paris Fashion Week fashion show.
A number of photos of incredible hats have been posted on Instagram this summer, and these designers have had their latest creations on display at fashion shows.
Valentino's masterpiece was a large light brown hat with wide feather-like bands that covered the models' heads.
Other accompanying items in the oversized display included watermelon-shaped gimlets, a seashell hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a number of strange masks, just in time for the Halloween season.
Many of the colorful masks had a folded beard and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than festive.
One mask resembles a chewing machine with a breathing tube and glasses, while another resembles a melting ice cream in the shape of bread.
If you want to be a fashionista, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats may soon be available in your local fashion store.
Large hats come close to the heels of La Bomba, a wooden hat with over two feet of weight that has graced heads from Rihonna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The logo on the back of the very unassuming hat, which was seen on all social media, was the inspiration for another large accessory that appeared on the fashion scene  a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The orange street suit, with the straw bars and the white leather handle, was the centerpiece of La Riviera SS10's Jacquemus Fatale at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stylist, told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer - with the designer having made such an impact, it should be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland are known for their students' outstanding achievements and this has continued in 2018 with new, magnificent test scores, further enhanced by individual and team competitions in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
These schools have a total of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) on their behalf, and they strive to provide the best possible services to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools are designed to prepare students for higher education, for their chosen careers, and for their status as global citizens.
As teachers who can design and teach according to customized curricula, we see that new languages continue to be popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart.
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show us that languages are at the top of the list with the highest percentage of students passing tests in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language got A's.
The data, collected from 74 schools within SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received A's in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received A's.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a necessary skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an elective, are given the same status as science-intensive subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for difficulty in hiring were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, this skill is essential in a crowded world.
Whatever career people choose, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future, but it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will give a polygamist an automatic advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two-letter prosaic, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for today's children to invest in language learning right away.
Multiples, especially in emerging markets, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the language taught varies from school to school.
A select number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, he will always be able to choose from a choice of languages in private schools with qualified teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It cannot be denied that in this time of global business, language continues to be essential for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be seen as international communication skills.
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
It's the right thing to do.
John Edwards is chairman of the Scottish Council for Private Schools
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' head coach, has announced that James will play in Sunday's season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be longer than a minute and shorter than 48. " Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers news anchor Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James would likely play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't have to play pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Timing for Trump's campaign rally in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a series of campaign rallies, the first of which is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he'll also make stops at friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his selection of a new Supreme Court justice now on hold, Trump is unfortunately trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of the House when the vote is in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to preside over the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, amid tensions over sexual harassment allegations.
But the main goal of Trump's meetings is to help the Republicans get better, as they face a tough election in November.
So the message from Trump's campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, are aimed at "filling the void and supporting the Republicans' drive to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and Congress", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so essential to the president's plan that he will travel to as many states as possible as the second term of his campaign begins", an unnamed Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's game will be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and is expected to draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's meeting will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, having won by over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, but he's down in the polls.
"It's not in Morrissey's best interest for the president to come and try to increase his popularity", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting will to keep hope alive for Sunday's individual competition
After three one-sided rounds, the four-game series on Saturday afternoon could be just what we needed in this Ryder Cup race.
The swing of success is a sporting concept that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in a competition like this.
Where would they say success now lies?
"They were six points ahead and now it's four points, so success is more on our side now, I guess", said Jordan Spieth as he started the day's race.
Europe, of course, is ahead, four points ahead with 12 more to go.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their sails and they can be hopeful about a lot, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played a great all-round role model.
The cheers rose as he entered the ring and he put down an important puck to guard all four points in the game after he and Thomas were down by two points after two games.
His punch, which gave them victory on the 15th hole, was met with similar cheers, the kind that tell you he believes the U.S. team still has a chance.
'You just have to dig deep and think about your own game,' said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup champions.
This strange but fascinating European couple has won four games out of four and can do no wrong.
Moliwood were the only couple to get Saturday afternoon school, but they also managed to avoid Saturday morning school, Friday afternoon school and the nine-hole course on Friday morning.
The game and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud spectators clearly shows that they are a couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a possible victory for the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun is setting over Le Golf National.
The best thing to do is to do it both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went easy on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's quarter, where he played with Alex Noren.
School and two doubles on the first nine holes drilled the Spaniard and the Swine into a hole they never managed to climb out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The foursomes and foursomes are so exciting to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, their advice, the advice they don't give, and how the game plan can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the final day, but this quarter-final also showed that the American team has the fighting spirit that some had doubted, especially other Americans.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's quarter-final and quarter-final, with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
All-star quarterbacks Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods, and have four points at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorn, eager to reclaim the trophy they lost at Hazeltine Stadium two years ago, showed a huge lead over the US team in the morning's foursome and won 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games but failing to close the points gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight, and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a spectacular weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quadruple sculls, they showed great teamwork, defeating Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius on rare occasions, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fours and quarters, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was exhausted for the morning's foursome, returned to his teammate, Henriks Stenson, in the foursome and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world rankings.
On this mild, sunny day southwest of Paris, however, Europe was not in the clear.
Three-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record by two points on Saturday.
They narrowly won 2-1 against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in the quarter-finals and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quarter-finals after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team won four points at the start of an individual event, although Fury's team needed only a draw to keep the trophy.
After two days of second best, however, Sunday's attack seems to be overwhelming.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament is "impossible" without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued trade bans only increase distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for the country to unilaterally dismantle its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "numerous acts of goodwill" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, shutting down the nuclear test site, and pledging to stop developing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the US, he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons first.
While Ri reiterated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special in that he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament outright as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim called for working towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and Trump issued a pledge to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease a strict trade ban on North Korea.
The United States demands that nuclear disarmament take place first and increases pressure by using a trade ban to achieve its goals, even opposing the declaration of an end to the war, said Ri.
It's just the fantasy of people who know nothing about us to think that a ban on trade can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that the continuing embargoes are adding to our distrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had discussed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister referred to three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, adding: If the party to this nuclear disarmament agreement were South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the standoff in the nuclear disarmament issue in the Korean Peninsula.
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the US mainland after "the devilish President" Trump called Kim "a suicide bomber".
Last year, Trump threatened to "degrade" North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courageous steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that trade bans would continue until North Korea had destroyed all of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: The Security Council's trade ban must remain in place until complete nuclear disarmament has been achieved and confirmed.
The Security Council unanimously extended a trade ban on North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, claiming success, but just hours later North Korea condemned him for making "ridiculous demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down its missile site and nuclear facility if the United States took "corresponding action".
He said Kim had told himself that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes in the middle of a break
A new study at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing tendency of students to stay up all night studying with the help of caffeine pills.
A study found that students at the world's best universities often know little or nothing about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the program, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the program after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on academic performance.
And at the end of the lecture, this girl came up to me and said, "Why is this only being told to me now, in my senior year?"
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which will be held for the first time this year, will explain to the students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and even promote general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the school's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after noticing that students were sleepy during the week.
The course is one hour long and includes a series of practical activities.
One section shows a room in a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, window boards, exercise shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how poor sleep can impair sports performance, as well as the importance of a good sleep routine.
In a second part, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school district with helpful symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of students at all.
But we feel that they have a right to know, just as a person has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that celebrates those who stay up all night studying still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the filtered pressures on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that students get enough good quality sleep should be their "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid becoming overweight, since lack of sleep increases the brain's demand for food, making the body sweaty.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physics student from California, helped Professor Czeisler put together the course, but he had attended one of the professor's courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a class for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master's students to complete similar courses before they start university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock to remind them to go to sleep and to wake them up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LEDs, which can disrupt the body's internal clock and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
The Rangers were still struggling in the outfield. Stevens Gerrard's team was split. They had to settle for a 1-0 loss to Livingston, on a goal from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox were looking for their first away win since their defeat at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrards' side only their second defeat in his 18 games as manager, now eight points behind Hearts, who are top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers seemed to lack all inspiration and were never likely to match.
Rangers now fall to sixth place, but Livingston moves up to third, just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
Rangers could face further problems after linebacker Calum Spence was placed on injured reserve after an object was thrown at him from the visitors' helmet.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the team that swept Ayr out and reached the quarter-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, kept the same Livi 11 lineup that reached the Hearts' level last week and he would have been pleased with how his well-trained teammates prevailed over the opposition.
The Rangers may have had more balls, but Livingston created more chances with the balls he caught.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when the first pitch from Menga came from Scott Pitman in front of Alan McGregor's goal, but he missed.
Long extra questions from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up on Craig Halkett as Alan Lithgow, his defensive partner, shot past the bar.
The Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live in hope rather than faith in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt he should have been given a pass in the fourth quarter when he and Steven Lawless were tied, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's call.
Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half, but Liam Kelly, Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, didn't have to do much to defend a bald from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Levi came in the 34th minute, despite the other team having the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, if only because of their perseverance.
The Rangers again failed to make any of the long extra time from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not break when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and chose to pass to Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard took over at halftime and sent Ryan Kent in to replace Coulibaly and the switch had an effect almost at the same time the fullback Morelos came in, but Kelly broke in quickly and ran up to close on the shot.
Livingston continued to urge the guests to play the very game they enjoyed, and Lithgow and Halkett each managed to get the long show on the other's feet.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor managed to deny Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to the goal from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' vice-captain, wanted another shot at him and Jacobs fell together, but Thomson turned it down again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here's a page from our Sunday Morning calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and THIS is the day that the futurist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for measuring and calculating radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called a Geiger meter.
The Geiger counter has since gained a firm foothold in the scientific community, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: What the hell is this?
This is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive materials on the surface of uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms from the radiation in the rocks.
It's really raining right now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "detect" and kill dangerous cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Treatment involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancer cells and inject it back into the patient
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from various types of cancer.
In one woman, ovarian cancer disappeared after more than 18 months because the vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory to detect a protein called HER2, which is found in many types of cancer, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Cancer Society in Bethesday, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that the vaccine is very effective".
HER2 causes various cancers to stop growing, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar technique, in which immune cells are taken from patients and used to attack cancer cells, has worked in treating one type of white blood cell.
Kanye West gave a lengthy speech in support of Trump and wore a MAGA derby hat after appearing on SNL.
It Didn't End Well
Kanye West was booed in the studio on a Saturday Night Live episode after a lengthy speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great derby, he spoke at length against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've spoken to white people so many times who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I would have been deported from the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a tease in which Hollywood star Matt Damon mocked Britt Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment allegations.
Although West's long-running show was not broadcast, a recording of it was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by releasing the tape.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received a poor reception from the back because of his mask choice.
I was put in a back seat.
And they said unto me, Go not up to the stage with this dove.
They put me in a cage!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole", he said, according to a report in the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the deep hole?" and said he was going to put on his superhero costume because that means you can't give me orders.
Try the love.
His reviews were met with audience applause at least twice, and SNL actors seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, with one bystander telling the paper: "There was a rock-solid silence in the studio".
West had been invited to appear on the show to replace singer Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his performance of "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA party, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for showing so much resistance".
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being himself and that's absolutely wonderful.
But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) who I feel is supporting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now veran who was previously known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and not to be forgotten is the music idol Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charges after knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of the Triple Crown, criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent adventure series The Crown.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has criticized the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such roles on screen often mean that young boys feel they have to be tough on themselves to earn respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow Olympic gymnast, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had "strong opinions" on how to handle the matter.
Personally, I feel at the moment - what has gone wrong with masculinity?
What have we taught men growing up about the problems we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to the very masculine characters on television.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be a certain type of man?
I think that's one of the most important questions of our time -- how do we change this?
Because it's obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not be starring in any other Kronilia series after the series ended next summer, saying that he had had enough of the battlegrounds and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about playing in the Commonwealth Games was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on these shows, so they somehow gave me my future family and my life after that", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's mistress, played by Kit in this Emmy-winning show.
The couple married in June 2018, in Leslie's family hometown of Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV or suffering from diarrhea.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted through sexual intercourse, a change from the previous situation.
Previously, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China because of donations of contaminated blood.
The number of people infected with HIV in this way has again fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or who are dying from it has increased by about 100,000 people year after year.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still a lot of discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the country's conservative policies, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections result from inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked documents from Republican senators, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "communist theories".
Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her staffers had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations came from "far-right" campaigners and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by unidentified sources on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over sexual harassment allegations.
The doctor arrived sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Content sites including Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP numbers that identify the source of the information were linked to Waters' office and published information about one of her employees, according to a Capitol Hill source.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and a lie", Waters continued.
My employee - whose privacy and security are now at risk because of these false allegations - was in no way responsible for this leak.
This unsubstantiated accusation is utterly false and a lie.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
"This denial is full of anger", wrote Fleischer.
It suggests that she has no aptitude for parliament.
When someone is unjustly accused, do not react with anger.
There is no resistance.
The reason for the accuser's accusation must not be questioned.
It must be calm and considerate.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's response to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said appeared to be overly angry at Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"A big deal if it's true", he said.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement of these false claims.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are found, she continued, and that they are held accountable for all the actions that are shameful and dangerous to all my employees.
The film critic for Johnny English Strikes Again - a spy thriller starring Rowan Atkinson - is showing little power.
It's become commonplace to look for Brexit references in all the new films where Britain is mentioned, and it seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series - which started in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just came back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this satire of how obviously miserable we are be a new export vehicle for the country?
Whether that is true or not, the outspoken, greedy, and clapping Johnny English has been granted a second renewed license to mess things up - his name, more than anything, indicates that he is a work of art designed for display in non-English-speaking countries.
He's, of course, the clever spy who pretends to live off of a stunning personality, but he's a little bit of a mix of Clouseau, dass of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the man who played one note for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the traveller and mysterious global citizen that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he got all upset.
There's a good thing or two about this latest Johnny English movie.
I loved watching Johnny English ride a helicopter wearing a medieval brooch and the helicopter blades in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his comedic abilities, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superficial, especially now that more serious films like James Bond and the Mission Impossible films also offer relentless humor.
The humor seems more for children than adults, and I found the adventure Johnny English ended up in not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent comedy in Mr. Bean.
The continuing premise of the film now is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A hacker has managed to break into Britain's secret intelligence network and uncover the identities of all British spies, much to the dismay of the spy on duty - but unfortunately Kevin Eldon is playing too small a role.
This is the final straw for the arrogant and controversial Prime Minister, already in great danger from massive political adversity: Emma Thompson does her best in her role as a persona reminiscent of Theresa May, but the script is not up to many fish for her.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who has already sat on the sacred stone.
And then Johnny English himself comes into the story, now principal of some fancy school, but also secretly giving lessons on how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes English is offering on a spy school reminiscent of the movie School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and there meets Bough, his former long-tired partner, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine captain, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite get to let her light shine.
The spy who messes up everything in Her Majesty's service is now back in the saddle and meets the high-class Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being charmed by the fascinating billionaire in the tech industry who claims to solve Britain's computer crisis: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their falling-out: they light up a fine French restaurant with a waiter as their waiter, they make a mess when they sneak into the luxury villa of Volta, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get a glimpse of the interior of the Volta house.
There is nothing to spare in that final scene, but while the film is lively and energetic, it lacks some childishness in its entirety.
It's a medium grade material.
And just like with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British film industry let Rowan Atkinson get a role that really matches his talents?
The Labour Party denies that it is planning a four-day workweek for the British, with the same pay as five days a week.
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants to let executives take advantage of the savings from the AI revolution and let employees benefit from one extra day off.
Then the workers could enjoy three days of long weekends, without a reduction in wages.
Sources say the idea would fit  the party's economic plan and its policy of improving the interests of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has supported a four-day work week as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A spokesman for the upper echelons of the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
The change will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is a goal that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy in favour of workers and with the overall party policy.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day workweek in its 2017 election campaign.
The aim, however, is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: The four-day workweek is not on the party's policy sheet and the party is not considering introducing it.
John McDonnell, the shadow commerce secretary, used last week's Labour conference to articulate his ideas of social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the "unknown directors" and "herb collectors" of the grain companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back as the Labour government could be subject to a "reduction" for alleged wrongdoing.
He has also approved plans to put workers on corporate boards and to create a joint-stock fund to give 10 percent of private company assets to their employees, who could receive £500 a year in profits.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say 60 minutes to see if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week of confusion in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether its findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I told you when the trial started, I told you I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were filed and said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, steadfast, unwavering.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be unchanged.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take an incredible prosecution to change that", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it firmly", Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one she names could confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new going to change.
What is the International Day of Citizens, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which will take place on Saturday in New York City, is an annual music event featuring a series of big stars with similarly powerful policies; ending poverty around the world.
In its seventh year, the International Urban Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to Central Park, not only to hear music from Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Day of the City, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international campaign that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who would pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or using other valid means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But with 12 years of planning, how successful has the festival been?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free music a real way to convince people to call for action, or is it just a so-called "snapshot" - where people feel they are doing something important by signing a demand letter online or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million actions from its supporters, calling for a variety of different causes.
It says that these efforts have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and targets worth more than $35 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had 390 commitments and announcements due to its activities, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have so far directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
One major commitment comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investment and executive organization that works to "help children enjoy themselves to the fullest", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end water scarcity, after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK Government, donors, governments around the world and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of food a thing of the past said Tracey Ullmann, spokesperson for The Power of Nutrition to a concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 petitions were sent that Britain should improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
Among the frequently asked questions on the group's website, one is: Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?
Global citizen replied: It will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail repeatedly.
But, we will reach our limits, just like the movements that fought for civil rights and the elimination of segregation before us, because we are stronger together.
This year's event will feature Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York City and will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as "obstruction" to block Russian energy exports, says interior minister
"If necessary", Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State, according to a report in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's assistance to Syria, especially since it works for the legitimate government there, would be a boon to exploring new markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy like they do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of it", he is quoted as saying.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and means to prevent it.
The US can use the navy to ensure that sea lanes are open and to create a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that energy from them does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at a meeting organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charitable group that calls itself the "Voice of the Energy Consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying it was more or less the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use less and less energy resources and replace them with others, he said, adding that Russia has only one card in mind with an economy that would depend on fossil fuels.
The announcements come as the Trump administration wants to increase its natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials in the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop its participation in the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 project to build a new power line, which Trump says would make Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the current 110 billion cubic meter pipeline, is purely an economic project.
The Russians say Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their own supplies, said Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The United States' position has been criticized by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to change the EU's policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very unhappy that an outside power is taking over our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, she says
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider running for City Council in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and shape our government, and then we need a woman as a leader", she said, according to a report from The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump at the meeting and said he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been unpopular in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that "of course we have to have the FBI investigate this before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that a majority of voters in Warren County do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent saying they favored his possible candidacy and 48 percent saying they were against it.
Other popular Democrats considered for the 2020 presidential nomination include Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont.
Biden said he plans to make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks about the shock-dispute issue Track Palin at the Donald Trump campaign rally
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"My son is going through a lot of hardship after returning, I feel for other families who are affected by the shock of the conflict and the emotional wounds our soldiers are coming home with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "come back a little different, they are hardened and wonder if there is any respect for what their comrades in the army and air force and other branches of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to obstruct a domestic violence report and carrying a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support the challenge to new asylum policy
Eleven states and Washington, D.C. support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the city filed a court filing Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who oppose the policy, according to an NBC News report.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal government has not been released.
She said that her husband and his violent gang members, sons, had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was taken into custody in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where gang-related and domestic violence problems are on the rise, and many asylum seekers in the United States come from these countries.
The new asylum guidelines reverse a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board to allow undocumented migrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Washington Attorney General, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of federal, state and international law".
Federal law requires that decisions on all asylum applications be made based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule, the court report said.
Lawyers further said in the report that the policy of denying immigrants entry was harmful to the U.S. economy, and that immigrants were more likely to start businesses and provide vital jobs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
"Those who leave their home countries because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum", said Sessions in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Health care was never meant to solve all the problems, not even the serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in a race to find survivors in Palu, as death toll doubles
The situation will become more difficult for the survivors.
"There is a lot of tension in the air", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her ailing son at the relief center in the city of Palu.
Ambulance buses are bringing bodies in here all the time.
There's little clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through the water for their belongings in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, lay outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were being evacuated due to the continuing strong aftershock.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how the earthquake had shaken his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up against the walls, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, saying his family had been in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "visiting" with "spyware"
A week after China's official news outlet published the last four ads in a U.S. newspaper discussing mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the Chinese newspaper's advertisement in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections.
Trump's claim that Beijing wanted to interfere in the US congressional elections marked what US officials told Reuters was a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in a escalating trade war, with new tariffs on imports from both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hurt immigrants in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, which exports much of its agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper that "China is now adding to its persecution by publishing propaganda in our own free media".
"In its broadening campaign, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's beloved freedom of speech and our free press by running a costly ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said in his article.
In contrast, few protest rhetoric can be found on newsstands in the streets of Beijing, and no real reflection can be found of the different views that Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic policies, with the media locked in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's largest newspapers had turned down an offer to publish his article, but he did not specify which newspaper.
Experts warn that Republicans are making women voters think twice about them before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh affair.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections, because many Republicans have backed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment.
There has been a lot of excitement around this issue and most Republicans have already publicly indicated that they want to start voting.
"You can't go wrong with this stuff", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Jeff Flake, the Republican senator from Arizona, would call a last-minute FBI investigation to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and not in November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a spokeswoman for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. news outlet.
On Friday morning, "November is Coming!" protesters began to gather on the Senate floor as the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of voters will skyrocket", said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news website.
People will say that there's already been a lot of interest, and it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president, but rarely vote.
Analysts predicted a setback if Republicans pushed for Kavanaugh's confirmation, even before Ford's testimony, in which she described her allegations of sexual harassment by him.
"This has become a major scandal for the Republican Party", said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be allowed to sit on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have handled her", Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps vote Democrats, told the news conference.
However, Americans seem to disagree on who to believe, based on the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, with the vast majority supporting the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to a report by The Guardian.
Ford testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 and that he was under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh used to carry his genitals in front of her when they were both at a party as students at Yale University in the 1990s.
The man who invented the Internet is planning to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to start a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech giant, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, an open source Berners-Lee platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do this now", he said of the motorcycle company.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses technology from Solid to allow people to create their own personal data store online or POD.
It may include a list of contacts, to-do lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work-related items.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it "personal choice using data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the tools, processes and appropriate expertise to help make Solid available to everyone.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security engineer who was bought by IBM, a few programmers who were hired as developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own standalone apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not be in discussions with Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would turn their current business model upside down overnight.
We don't ask them for their permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday on Medium that Inrupt was "aimed at creating a business powerhouse and ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based Web".
Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and president of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he establishes Inrupt.
"I am optimistic about the next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest and World War I recipient of the Victoria Cross honored
The only English priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a soldier has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Sergent Bernard Vann, a lieutenant colonel in the army, received the Cross on 29 September 1918 during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, and he was never told that he had been awarded the British Army's highest decoration.
Two of his relics were unveiled at a memorial service in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his sons, Michael Vann, said that it was "marvelously symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's dedication.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his squadron across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, through very thick fog and under heavy parachute and machine gun fire.
Later, he ran to the line of fire and with "great courage" led the line before attacking a paratrooper in his unit and overpowering three soldiers.
Lieutenant-Colonel Von was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's heroics were "something I could never do, but something that makes you humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid wreaths after the procession, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the legacy of a true hero is shown by the support that so many people show".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 instead of seeing Gurru Pig
Imagine, having stayed up all night to watch the overcrowded Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The schedule featured 13 battles from San Jose, six of which were on the main page and were broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers got an unexpected twist when the broadcast changed to "Growl Pig".
Some were dissatisfied after having stayed up all night to watch the battle.
One Twitter user described the baby-sitting shift as "a kind of joke sickness".
"According to official rules, the content was not suitable for viewers at 6am, so they had to switch to children's content", said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the show.
- The pig, yes.
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they would review their schedules and include UK viewership in the future.
"I think, when I think about the re-shows, we could probably work this out", Coker said.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday there, and we can't solve this until Sunday, which is Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show was switched, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise this won't happen next time.
We're gonna limit the night to five fights instead of the usual six, but we tried too hard and we got ahead of ourselves.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt "disempowered" by his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling discriminated against because of his sexuality, but that it motivated him to succeed.
Daley, 24, said that he did not realize that he was "different" until he went to law school.
On the Desert Island Discs radio show on Radio 4, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that his parenting had distracted him from winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host, has taken a few months off for health reasons.
Daley was able to appear on the first episode of Laverne and said that he felt he was "less of a man" than everyone else when he was a child because "it was not accepted in society to be liked by both boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those feelings of being unworthy and different have given me the strength and vigor to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when it finally came up about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has made a name for herself as an LGBT supporter and used her participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he felt lucky to be able to live in public without punishment and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but said the age difference had never been a problem.
When you go through so much at such a young age - but he took part in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find a peer of his age who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that all his views on life had been shaken.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son is baptized in memory of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had received their medals for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was not until his breathing stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I just knew I'd dreamed of this all my life, to dive in front of the home crowd at the Olympics.
It was also the inspiration for the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and dead sitting on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he's got to find his old rhythm again so that the record isn't surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who is playing in the tournament for the 12th time in a row, was benched after referee Jim Furyk's decision to postpone Saturday's quadruple sculls and fours.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has been so often before for the United States, the five-time champion splits his day between being a fighter and practicing his moves on the court in the hope of correcting his own problems.
Mickelson, 48, was never the one to shoot straight with the drums, and he's not the best player for Le Golf National, where long shots often get a penalty for a bad shot.
And not only is the course a challenge in itself, but Mickelson will also face Frances Molinari, the British Open champion, in Game 9 on Sunday, with Molinari and rookie Tommy Fleetwood on the team, and together they have won all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in their first of 12 singles matches, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be a game changer.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but he could hardly say much else.
"He understood the role he had today perfectly, patted me on the back and hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's been such a huge asset to the teams before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I had more in mind, but that's how it ended, and we decided we had to go that way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached quite as high as the second-most in his record.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence had a certain ambiguous impact on the team.
He is funny, he is cool, he is funny, he likes to make fun of people and it's great to have him in the team room, he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed playing him this week, too, and it was fun to watch.
He gives so much more than just the golf game.
Thomas Bjorn, the European leader, knows that much progress can be quickly lost.
European champion Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good lead on the final day of an individual Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where the side under striker Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but managed to claim victory at the end with the lowest possible score, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, but just right", said Bjorn, pictured here, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 on both Friday and Saturday and take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
This story will show me and everyone on this team that this is not over.
We'll all be on the ground tomorrow.
Let's go and make it right.
This isn't over until all the points are on the board.
We have our goal and it's trying to win this cup, we're focused on that
I've always said this, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're very aware of our mothers on the other team -- the best golfers in the world.
Bjorn was very pleased with the way his players had handled themselves on a difficult pitch, adding: "I never outperform myself in this.
Tomorrow, everything will be different.
Tomorrow, it's the performance of the individuals that counts, and that's another thing.
It's great to play with a group when everything is going well, but when you play alone, everyone's golfing skills are tested.
That's the message we need to send to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and you have to play your best game yourself.
Unlike Bjorn, his mother-in-law, Jim Furyk, will try to make his players perform better in individual matches than with teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this great transformation of the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed the miracle in Medina.
"I remember every fucking word", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, who died in 1999, would have pushed his players forward for the final day.
We got 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to start fast like you did in Brooklyn and Medina.
As the crust builds up, it puts a lot of pressure on the central players.
We sorted our players accordingly and let them play the way we think will work best tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defense and plays against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
I chose these players in this order because I think they cover the whole way through, said Bjorn about his selection of players in the individual competition.
Germany's new warship delayed yet again
The German Navy's newest warship was supposed to be built in 2014 to replace older Cold War-era warships, but it won't be ready until early next year due to broken systems and rising costs, according to local reports.
Construction of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to sources from a Navy spokesman speaking to Die Zeit.
The ship was scheduled to be commissioned in 2014, but serious problems after delivery hampered the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the aging Bremen-class ships.
They must be equipped with a more powerful parachute, multiple anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and field equipment on board with reduced radar, infrared, and sonic signals.
Other important features are longer service life - the latest ships should be able to be used for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, persistent reports indicate that these new-fangled warships - which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate its strength at sea - will be obsolete when they are finally put into service, says Die Zeit.
The F125 made headlines last year when the German military officially refused to accept the aircraft and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to its manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but the German press reported that many women were seriously "caring about software and machinery" that would render the warship useless if sent into combat.
The gaps in equipment were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be manned by a crew of 120, half the size of the Bremen class.
It also became apparent that the ship was becoming too heavy, which was reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to make future repairs.
The 7,000-tonne ship Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the operator - has become problematic.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), from an original estimate of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing the latest ships are particularly important in light of warnings that German naval superiority is waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defense committee, admitted that the navy was in fact becoming a "super-corps" with a working ship.
The delegate said that the problem had been solved over time, since older ships were being retired but not replaced.
He was disappointed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class' orders could be used by the Marines.
The National Trust Conservation Society spies on the secret life of the leatherback
A new study in a rural area of the Scottish Highlands aims to understand how leatherbacks use the landscape when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these solitary flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor different types of leather blocks in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key sites around the site to monitor the behaviour of the leather blades over the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be taking surveillance trips with handheld sensors.
Specialists will analyze all the recordings to determine the frequency of the calls, the leather blocks, and which species are doing what.
Habitat maps and reports will then be published to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the findings will shed light on which habitat is most important for the leatherbacks and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the costs of habitat management, for example by creating a meadow, and how best to maintain forest land for leatherbacks and other related species.
Leather blocks have declined dramatically in the last century in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lights can also pose a risk, as can airplane paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Leather blocks aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to fishing for sharks, since they are used to fishing at night.
They use sophisticated rock-climbing techniques to detect insects and objects in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes leather blocks very seriously.
The organizations have a staff of ten specialists who regularly perform inspections, stock checks, and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even established Scotland's first and only leather-block farm at Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten leather-block species.
David Thompson, the farm manager, says that it is the perfect area for them.
"The area here by Threave is great for leather blocks", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and lots of good housing.
But there's still a lot that's unknown about leather blocks, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to clean.
He stressed the importance of checking leather blocks before maintenance is carried out on farms, where possible accidental destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 female and juvenile leather blocks and affect all leather blocks in the area.
Leatherbacks are protected and it is forbidden to kill, harm or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about leather blocks, and we don't know how well how many of them work".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called allegations of rape against him "fake news" and says people "want to draw attention" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers that they were "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
"What was said today is fake news", the five-time world champion told the camera.
These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's only natural.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over what they have called "unacceptable publication of a suspected privacy violation", according to Reuters.
His lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would seek a fine of the same amount as the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney's Office in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was a 99% good person who fell for the 1% temptation.
The documents claim that Ronaldo agreed to the couple having sex, but that it was with their mutual consent.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had her effects photographed in the hospital, but eventually agreed to settle outside the courtroom because she was "scared of reprisals" and worried about being "humiliated in public".
She now says she wants to end the relationship because she's still in shock after the incident.
Ronaldo was close to moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape allegedly took place, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain would 'look back forever' on losing its car manufacturers
Britain would "look back on it forever" if it lost its position as the global leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, says Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "of concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border losses if a no-deal Brexit became a reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production lines in our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement on how to conduct cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are what carmakers say are supply chain risks if a no-deal Brexit becomes a reality.
Toyota's production line is based on "last-minute acceptance", where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from stock in both the UK and EU for cars produced to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that the industry believes could lead to shortages and supply shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for a future relationship with the EU is specifically aimed at countering these views on borders.
We need to have a deal.We want the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only success in the present, but also an opportunity that we can take advantage of, he said on BBC Radio 4.
The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers as well, shows that we must be able to move forward with very effective interventions.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the longer term, higher costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee of the factory's workers' union, said that his colleagues were increasingly worried: My experience is that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.
The Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House announced on Sunday that a crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, assistant U.S. attorney, could be "postponed for another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Roberts Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of the president's legitimate agenda.
For weeks, there have been rumors in Washington about whether Trump will fire an assistant U.S. attorney, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, but he was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't" want to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then adjourned to coincide with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has sued him for sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There's no date set for him, it could be this week.
But we'll take care of it and I'm always happy to inform the media.
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the small number of meetings was not because of dissatisfaction with the fact that television journalists had "visual personalities", but she did say: "I don't disagree with the fact that they have visual personalities".
She then gave hints that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
The President answers more media questions than any other President before him, she said, without citing sources: We have reviewed these figures.
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me".
We're trying to do a lot of that, and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace press conferences when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
Perhaps the president showed why in New York this week, when he displayed a disrespectful and at times bizarre behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Health minister writes to EU health workers in Scotland over Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working within NHS Scotland to express the nation's gratitude and wishes it to continue its work after Brexit has been passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter when less than six months remain until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to cover the cost of work permit applications for EU nationals working in the public service sector.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: "Over the summer, talks between the UK and the EU over the Brexit have continued and a decision is expected in the autumn.
The British government has also been preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
I therefore want to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the work of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the healthcare system and benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is so truly your home and we want you to stay here forever.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a report by Mike Organ, a reporter for the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters the impact had begun shortly before the half.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there", Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before he was put on a stretcher and carried out for further examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was still little information about the nature or severity of the impact and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, a senior in high school, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before he went out, bringing his total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be squeezed for higher premiums when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher premiums when they buy property in the UK, with the proceeds going to help the homeless, under a new Conservative plan.
The move will undermine Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The National Trust plans to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher premiums when they buy property in the UK, with the proceeds going to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promising affordable housing and taxing the underclass.
Individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher premiums, and the surplus will go to government measures to help the homeless.
The increase - in addition to the current premium, including the increase imposed two years ago on extra housing and rental property - could be as high as 3%.
The government estimates that the increase will raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of new housing in London is being bought by foreigners, which is driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to enter the market.
Many economic areas of the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in incentive payments to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to end quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing deficit".
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of significant housing reforms, including the rental department and an end to evictions without charge.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would devote myself to restoring the British dream in my first term - that each new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our broken housing market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for foreign parties and companies with headquarters abroad to buy a home as it is for British nationals.
For many, the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the stigma of homelessness is even more real.
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to coach Scotland".
Jack Ross, Sunderland manager, says his "top goal" is to become Scotland manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scot is now taking on the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East club, now in third place in the Premier League, three points off the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after re-signing St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I injured my knee and that was the end of it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland a lot in Hampden with my dad, as a kid, and there's always something that's pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I managed to coach the division.
Ross' previous coaching positions at Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such big names at such a big club, but he had previously turned down coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Even so, I will measure my success by thinking, 'Can I get this club back in the Premier League?'
This club is unquestionably at home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities, he said.
It's not an easy job to get him up there, but I'd probably only consider myself successful here if I got the club back up there.
Ross has only three years' experience as a coach, following a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division, and turned St Mirren, who were on the verge of relegation, into league champions the following season.
Ross says he's more confident now than he ever was in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real time-trial", he says of the time when he became Alloa's coach.
I really believed that coaching was for me, even more so than playing.
That sounds strange, because I was doing well, making a decent income, and having moderate success.
But making changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of the stress and pressure of my job, but coaching just seems right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I've never felt better about myself in all my adult years.

The best time for a beer is 5:30 on Saturdays, according to a poll.
This summer's heat wave has been devastating for British baristas who are rich in basil, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales at pubs and bars rose 2.7 percent in July, while sales at restaurants fell 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and England's unexpected success at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when bar sales rose by 2.8 percent, except for even lower restaurant sales.
Restaurant sales fell 1.8 percent in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, which are primarily focused on selling liquor, lasted the longest with more excitement while restaurants plummeted.
Pubs selling food also had a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems like people just wanted to go out and drink.
Pubs and bars' beverage sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of the analytics firm RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales at out-of-home markets.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups are still struggling, although a 4.8 percent sales drop between months is especially painful on top of continued cost pressures.
This long, hot summer could hardly have come at a worse time for a diner, and only time will tell whether temperate temperatures, such as we have had in August, will improve the situation.
The overall growth in pub and restaurant sales, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the pace of opening.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK pub-bar and restaurant industry tracker, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is the industry benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents
One in five children under the age of 11 has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in the number of Instagram pages
News reports have raised concerns about the publication of pornography
Twenty percent of the students say they have a total bill that they show their parents.
One in five children under the age of 11 has a secret social-media account that they keep from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a huge increase in ger Insta accounts - a reference to the website Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean bill to show their parents, as well as a secret one.
One mother, who had stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site, found a teenager who was encouraging others to rape me.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Council of Chief State School Officers (HMC), showed that 40 per cent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: It is worrying that so many young people are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle to become the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Athletics Commission
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive chairman at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful female freestyle swimmer and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said the appointment was a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her vast experience at international level over the past decade.
Eilidh is highly respected within the sporting community in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are sure that sport in Scotland would benefit greatly from her being on the committee, said Beattie.
Doyle said: I am very interested in speaking on behalf of the athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help to take the sport forward in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now is a regular on the BBC, was paralyzed after a brief hemorrhagic stroke.
He tweeted: "One month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It has been hard work, but I have made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and am exercising today!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!
Breast pump advertisement that compares a mother to a cow causes an online controversy
A company that makes breast pumps is now making headlines online because of an advertisement that features dairy cows being milked by mothers.
Elvie Company released a related advertisement to promote what it says is "the world's first portable sound breast pump". The ad, inspired by music videos, is meant to show the freedom that the new pump offers to mothers who are breastfeeding their babies.
Four real mothers dance in a bowl full of hay and cum to a song with lyrics on the table: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any hair on me" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't juices, these are my breasts".
The appendix goes on: "Pump, pump, I'm feeding the children, pump, pump, I'm pumping milk from the Christmas tree".
However, the ad, which appeared on the company's Facebook page, has caused a stir online.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and has received mixed reviews from viewers, many of whom say it has captured the "craziness" that comes with dairy farming.
Really bad decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become calves and give birth to produce milk, except that the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born", said one commentator.

Another viewer wrote: Really hard for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can hold their babies?
Another added: "This ad is totally out of date".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "the best".
I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought one of these if I still had a baby on my chest.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of my body.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
"This is a genius", wrote one of the spectators.
Another said: This is a funny ad directed at mothers who pump milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cum.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the ad, the women's group shows that they were all dancing with their breast pumps folded into their helmets.
The idea behind the campaign is that many women say that they feel like a pig when they pump out milk.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or leads, and fits comfortably on top of the bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and president of Mother, said: "Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a high-profile promotion that would make a splash.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to shine a spotlight on the breast pump and all its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made the news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared at a fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved into tents at the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has increased sharply even though the number of those crossing the border monthly has remained somewhat stable, in part because the tough policies and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made it harder to place the children in foster care.
Usually, the adoptive parents have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they are afraid of jeopardizing their chances of staying in the country by offering to adopt a child.
The threat increased in June, when government officials announced that prospective adoptive parents and other adults within the household would be required to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the Senate that his agency had arrested a number of people who applied to adopt single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on record.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in foster care are in the country illegally, and many of them are illegal immigrants on record.
'We will continue to search for these individuals,' said Mr Albence.
In an effort to speed up the process of resolving the children's cases, officials announced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of being placed in custody, rather than the previous standard of 60 days, according to a law enforcement official.
Many will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their legal position before an immigration judge.
Children deemed unfit to enter the country are quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent behavior or attempts to escape, according to emergency workers and reports released by the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution like Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that a child is having difficulty because of the number of children.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without giving them sufficient time to prepare spiritually or to say good-bye to friends could add to the trauma that many of them are already experiencing.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish "teams" to withdraw now instead
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in a speech to the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were in Syria illegally, under the false pretense that they were fighting terrorism, and that they would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told parliament.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy fight until we clear all Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and all illegal foreign elements.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return and he taught some Western countries to spread unjustified fear that encouraged refugees to stay away.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return, he said.
They create a government out of something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN recalls that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone at the last major bastion of the conflict has created an opportunity for continued political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had a "definite deadline" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and that they would be eliminated.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN ambassador, hopes to attend the first meetings with a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to negotiate a constitution for Syria after the war and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to overriding the decisions of the current government, and warned against any interference.
Reasons why Trump will win a second term
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would win reelection in 2020 unless impeachment and shock ended his presidential career, as many liberal observers likely expect.
In what would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to a presidential career ever!
As it is, the audience shows no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has peaked at 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to, because this is something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a government employee who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comic book writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The bus driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he comes to make me laugh,'" Miss Scovell said to me.
There's a fun thing about chaos.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, the reunification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privileges can afford to stop watching.
And yet it's more than being an informed citizen when you look at the sixth time a panel of experts has argued for Bob Woodwards' use of "Fear" as a source for his book "Fear", or the $15,000 strawberry jacket that Paul Manafort wore (a look that's stuffed with pride, the Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's detailed biology of Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes you feel like a reality star is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", discussing the Trump show's staffing and daily storyline changes (such as starting a fight with the NFL and praising Kim Jong-Un in the park).
You can't miss one element, or you lose the wire.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, it was 85 degrees outside his home on the North Shore of Kauai, but he stayed inside and watched MSNB while he taped CNN.
He couldn't stay away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
I remember when we were making all these crazy things in the old days and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out people were right.

Money out of circulation in the closest election of the Middle Ages
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing the money flow in, thanks to a redistricting that has seen two representatives run for the same seat.
The newly redistricted Pittsburgh area is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election last summer.
Lamb is running against another representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which is in a major dispute with the new 17th District.
The map of the electoral districts was reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were organized in favor of the Republicans and that it violated the Constitution.
The race for the new 17th District has been the start of a campaign finance rivalry between the two major funders of both parties, the Democratic-Republican-Congressional-Congressional-Congressional (DCCC) and the Republican-Republican-Congressional-Congressional (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after his narrow victory in a special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which was widely watched.
Republicans had previously held the seat for more than a decade and Donald Trump, the president, won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight head start.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners removed the Trump administration team from the coalition.
State Department officials decided to recall the US ambassadors to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received US$140 million in aid in 2017, including for drug control, development work and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, which has high unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from migrating to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking delegates made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, thus ending any doubt about sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to address the summit, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of how important it is to the administration, the minutes said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the discussions described by the three U.S. representatives, including two foreigners, who agreed to discuss internal allegations on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside commentator who works closely with the administration and also spoke on the subject on condition of anonymity.

The next big scandal could be the report by special counsel Roberts Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, but that accusation is backed by a wealth of public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress is controlled by another party, Trump may have to answer for it, as he prepares to meet his constituents again, and possibly a retrial of his fellow senators.
These are very uncertain, however, and I do not want to imply that the fall of Trump is certain, nor that the fall of his European colleague is.
We all have a choice, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler if only the Western powers would give him the support of the Czechoslovak people in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the disastrous years that followed.
The story revolves around these crucial points and the speed or difficulty of the unstable progress of democracy.
The Americans are facing some of these critical points right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the man who's in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad spot since this newspaper reported last year that he had proposed secret recordings of the president and discussed his incompetence.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is not true.
How will we respond if the newly-commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we elect a midterm Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail this test, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that had been in my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I but look to our future with a positive eye?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers team captain, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing a win against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to progress from Europa League Group G. Rangers drew a magnificent draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to better results.
"It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team", said Dorrans, 31.
We started the game believing we could make something happen and ended up taking one point.
We might have been able to claim victory in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came in stronger in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another big night for the Europa League.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did well in their last game, but with the fans behind us, I'm sure we can handle this and get a positive result.
Last year was a difficult one, both because of my injury and the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the area.
The team's good and the boys are enjoying themselves, the training's good.
Hopefully we can move on now, put the last game behind us and make it.
Women lose sleep for fear of losing their retirement savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of it, but it doesn't take the right steps to have those conversations", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's how you start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not make your wishes clear to them well in advance.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you will receive care, as these options can make a big difference in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor involved: Your advisor can also help you to find a way to cover these expenses.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with a long-term care plan, mixed life insurance that pays cash to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get a healthcare professional so that you can appoint someone you trust to supervise your healthcare and ensure that healthcare professionals follow your wishes if you cannot express them directly.
Consider also getting a proxy holder for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to see that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Remember the details: Imagine that your aged parent has an emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Make sure that you have a written plan to give these details accurately.
It's not just about the money, but also who the doctors are, said Martin.
What are the drugs?
Who's gonna watch the dog?
Have a plan ready.
Man shot multiple times with a shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air gun while walking home from a night out.
The victim is a man in his 50s who was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, groin and hand.
The MPs describe the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 local time, as a "handgun attack".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The man was not seriously injured and police have called witnesses.
Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people died after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With all communications down, relief workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu and near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were displaced in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and flood struck.
Donggala is a district that stretches over 380 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is administratively a county, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Floods have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a flash flood that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, there were floods in western Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the active Pacific Ring of Fire and is prone to earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and floods of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra struck on December 26, triggering a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing tsunami waves along the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of a province in western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing 10-meter-high waves that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya district of Aceh, causing devastation and fear, as people remember the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No floodwaters formed this time, but over 100 lives were lost as buildings collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists on the island.
Eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, has been arrested on a charge of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, attempting to obstruct a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report a suspected crime.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su station awaiting trial and is being held on a $500 bond, according to a news release from KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty, but was asked to plead guilty or not guilty, according to the news outlet.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the intended attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing a domestic violence report and carrying a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by activist groups in 2016 after she gave a shock-discussion lecture about her son's violent behavior after his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications systems are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing the incident are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tidal wave hit the beach.
Prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that left eight people dead, a rare death sentence that has not been used in the state for federal offenses since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have hired a Home Depot van to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" inflicted grievous bodily harm, according to the death penalty application, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges could lead to a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of criminally negligent homicide, which is usually used by prosecutors in prosecutions of organized crime, and one count of violent disorder and one count of vehicular manslaughter.
The attack involved "a number of premeditated acts", prosecutors said, describing Sapiov's actions as "terrible, brutal, and immoral".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was wounded, injured and lost to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, says the will.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last handled a death penalty case.
The other defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was in 1953 in a New York court case involving Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was sorry for what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he got the idea for the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction for life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the impact of this incident for all concerned, said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "activate the People's Army" today at a protest at the Conservative Conference.
This former Ukip leader said that politicians should "stand up to pressure" from EU sceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone told a Birmingham protest that Britain "would be leaving" now if Mr Farage was the leader of Brexit.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling a deep rift between her own teammates was even more evident as Conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, joined other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers plan on track and is under criticism from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
Allies claimed she would continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - forcing those opposed to Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and 'uncertainty'.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest march in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of the Chequers scheme.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to take part in and assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out of here by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: I will support Brexit but we must get rid of the Chequers plan.
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: We do not fight world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone pointed to evidence that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: The idea that the British public has changed its mind and will to remain silent is completely untrue.
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative Brexit supporter, was also in the protest march and told reporters: "I simply want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the public and the opposition will not vote for it, it will be unpopular with our party members and activists who are out in the streets voting for us.
Do it, stop with the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a direct message to May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.
Mr Farage said politicians would be "pressured" to back down from the decision taken following the 2016 vote.
It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political party, he said.
They want to try and cheat Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not let you get away with this.
He added in his message to the crowd: "I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is on the verge of breaking away from Brexit.
We are activating a people's army in this country that won us Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.
Meanwhile, supporters of the EU held a protest march in Birmingham, ending with a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists fished the anti-Brexit Conservative flags after the group was formed over the weekend.
Adonis Loward, from the Labour Party, made fun of the Conservatives over a security issue that came up in the party's phone app when the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computers and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for borderless, for free trade with Ireland without borders", he added.
This is a complete shock.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren is going to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she intends to seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to a report in the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the focus of speculation about whether she could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th in the form of a town hall meeting with residents of her constituency since Trump took office.
One of the people in attendance asked her if she had any plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then we also need a woman as a leader.
Arrest following fatal shooting at LSU Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that they have arrested one of the suspects in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Murphy J. Paul, police chief, told reporters Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, with a weapon in his hands, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-2 guard from Baton Rouge, who played in 32 games, including 10 starts, last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel hands him the winning seat at the behest of his teammates.
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas took the front seat to Lewis Hamilton at the pre-race on Saturday that Mercedes' commands would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton after defending his position in the first two corners and inviting Vettel to fight his team-mate.
Vettel took the lead and let Hamilton drive into the end zone, but that should have been the deciding factor.
The Mercedes went into the ditch one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton emerged from a close fight where the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inside after being at risk of being left behind after a defensive attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started late in the group and was seventh at the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race, postponing a tyre change to try to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He finally went into the ditch on lap 44, but could not increase speed on the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
This is a tough day because Valtteri has been doing great all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me get ahead.
The team has worked incredibly hard to achieve this", said Hamilton.
That was a really bad show.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for her claims that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "wild and cruel and untested".
The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and hurt and cruel and uncontrollable, he said.
When you see the exposures and the lies and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you get this?
Remember her answer... you unlock the file - oh, ha, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I'm not gonna stop it.
Now, just wait a minute.
"Let's stop... no, we're not", he said, and he followed the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, setting out Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and was leaked in early September.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not cover up her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to a report by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I did as she asked.
But her denial didn't seem to go over well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday, "I'll tell you, that was a really bad show.
Maybe she didn't leave anything out, but that was the worst body-show I've ever seen.
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, and warned that Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to regain power, no matter what the methods.
You see the cruelty, the desperation, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overpower to gain power and control", the president said, according to a report from Mediaite.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their Elite League defeat on Friday against the Belfast Giants, by winning their next game, 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early two-point lead after scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game at home, but Dwyer then brought the Giants back across.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
This was Adam Keefe's third defeat of the season in the Elite League, but it was a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth quarter, at 3:35 p.m., after a punt from Kendall McFaull, followed by a punt from David Rutherford when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
There was a lot of pressure in the first few minutes, and Sullivan brought the home team back into the game with 1:10 left, and Cownie then tied it after a substitution from Matt Marquardt in the 15th minute.
Dwyer saw to it that the Giants crossed the line before halftime when he scored his second goal of the game late in the first quarter.
The home team rallied and Bouchard equalised again after a goal when they were one man ahead in the 27th minute of the second leg.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together and helped Nielsen to get Dundee over for the first time in the game late in the second quarter, and he secured his team's victory with the fifth goal as the final quarter was half over.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will take on Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller gives his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane survive an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he gave his life to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Large aftershocks continue to hit the area, and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Twenty-one-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, even though his colleagues had escaped the control tower that was hovering above the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was about to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could safely take off.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He later died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News in Australia.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
We are very sad to hear this, he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could exceed 1,000, with the country's disaster agency saying access is restricted to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the organisation.
Waves of up to 20 feet [6 m] have caused more devastation in Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
The military and airliners are bringing in relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's very little clean water.
The small markets have been looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN in an interview: The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to find survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the Indonesian military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said a CNN report.
Earlier this year, earthquakes struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one is missing after plane crashes over Lone
The airline, whose plane crashed into Lone Star in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, after earlier reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon it was not aware of the abduction of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's details, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Marine Corps both said the plane had landed in the bay just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane's approach was very low.
"It was really good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to dive to the bottom of the water and find emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were scared and screaming and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to fix a pier also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
Air Safety Authority data show that 111 people have died in crashes involving PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, spent hours in the courtroom as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He then described to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the travels of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had been able to obtain location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his earlier claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When records showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was a "lie, because my car was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said she knew Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, phone calls and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defendants are scheduled to deliver their final statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be heard later that day.
What is a conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to combat negative attitudes toward the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins as it contained a political message and dealt with social issues.
They want to trace the origins and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York foster parents sue a couple for breaking and entering after a "disrespectful" text message
A foster mother in New York is suing a couple for unlawful rape after she received a surprise text message from her mother complaining that she was a "real black person".
The couple therefore deny any prejudice and liken the law to "censorship".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure when she discovered her new fetus, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, the "embarrassing" Plasco-Flaxman, Mrs. Maurice, said that their former foster mother, who was a total stranger, had been in poor health and that she was expecting a Filipino woman, according to a New York Post report.
Miss Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice is now suing the couple and demanding damages for the violation of the tax, $350 a day for the six months of work she was originally hired to do, although no contract was signed.
I wanted to show them that this is not the way to do things", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know this is discrimination".
The couple have denied the accusations of prejudice and say that it was the right thing to do to fire Maurice because they felt that they could not trust her after her abuse.
My wife sent her a message she wasn't going to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people", said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But who would trust their children to someone after they have shown such stupidity, even if it was surprising?
You had your baby?
Don't be like that.
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "coup d'etat", saying his wife was seven months pregnant and in "very difficult circumstances".
Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
It's not very nice", said Plasco, who works in the investment industry.
The case is still pending, but the public has been vocal about the couple on social media, and they have been shamed for their behavior and rational behavior.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very funny now that we know of Paddington's enormous success.
She said her father, who worked as a photographer for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a small teddy bear, had taken the rejection of his work with a roaring positive, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "delightful" after his passing last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of the family", she added that her father had shown a silent pride in his success in the end.
"He was a very quiet man and not used to being rude", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who did something, and you're proud of it even if you didn't actually do it yourself.
I think he's the one who's ever looked at Paddington's success in that way.
Although Paddington was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the credit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but to no avail.
Nad called me regularly and told me that her condition was very bad, that she was not expected to survive, said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me and said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart beating were slowly losing their effect and were being eliminated from her body.
She had died a short time before and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I could not cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing of her plight.
"No one knew anything", she said.
I was shaking my head and crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt very sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hang messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women whose loved ones attempted suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I have to every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room.
He stopped working before he died, for he was "sunk down to a very dark place".
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler found his brother dead from a suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about the aftermath".
Ms. Davis created the message to let people know that it's okay to go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit and say nothing - you need to talk to someone.
Miss Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about feeling bad or depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his temper.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She said that his death was a shock, but that they needed to work through it: "This rift has affected the family.
This is tearing us apart.
But we must persevere and fight.

The future of Bret Kavanaugh hangs in the balance. The FBI has its own investigation.
I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study with limited time and scope - we might be able to reach some kind of compromise, Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was being split amidst a dispute between the parties where everything was backwards.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigating this?
Their movements are due to timing.
With the midterm elections only five weeks away, on November 6th, if the Republicans do not fare as well as expected, it will seriously undermine their efforts to get their man elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senate to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its investigation report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit as they are.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to secure at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him as Supreme Court Justice.
The number of people fleeing North Korea is declining under Kim's rule
The number of people fleeing North Korea for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Unification Council of South Korea, said 1,127 people fled last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees charged to people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those who flee North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded neutral zone between North and South Korea.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return home.
Relations between North and South Korea, still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that focused on postponed nuclear disarmament talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in broad terms to work together towards a nuclear-free Korea.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told U.S. businessmen about the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally dismantle our nuclear weapons first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "maternal sickness" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, "maternal sickness", and said he was too shy to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi dropped those words in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever left like this, she would have been called a maternal disease", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and getting a kick in the neck when he spoke about his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him "abhorrent and planned homicide" that was orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he showed a bias toward Democrats.
"I think these statements and the way he attacked the Clinton wife and the Democrat shows he's unfit for the job", she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's removal if he is confirmed and if the Democrats gain a majority in the Senate.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's in", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law Roe v. Wade, where he is considered a conservative judge.
During his interview, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a morbidly obese, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say 'How wonderful is this?'" said Pelosi.
And women need to take advantage of that.
It's a fairy tale, months and years of passion flowing out of her, and she won't go away without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
I don't think that's uncommon, do you?
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said she cried when she got angry, too, but she had developed a technique so that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to her mentor, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off.
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.
In part, tears are permissible expressions of anger because they are misunderstood in basic terms.
One of my clearest memories from my first job was in an office with mostly men, where I started crying from a rage I couldn't express, and an older woman came and grabbed me by the ankle.
"Don't let them ever see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're pissed.
They think you are stupid and are glad that they have got you.
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president, but she was then a Democratic senator from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught red-handed on board a boat called the Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Mrs. Schroeder, in a rage, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said to me, laughing, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Whitey and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign running late, she was behind on fundraising, so she said she would not run unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not run, she was so overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude to the people who had supported her, resentment toward the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and focus on voters rather than representatives, and anger at the racial divide - that she broke down in tears.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown", said Ms. Schroeder, recalling the media reaction.
You'd think Kleenex would be my strength.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my headstone?
She was crying?
Why a U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were glorious, and while the war is far from over, the trade between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired his first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's main exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, taxing almost half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in kind each time, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has been known to respond to U.S. tariffs, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to leave anytime soon.
To make Washington bow, you have to waive the demands, but it would be too degrading for Xi Jinping, the President of China, to publicly bow to the United States.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing is right, the pressure of the trade war with the United States could have a long-term positive effect on China, reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
The fact that a hasty political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that leads to a recession in either country is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged, said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses primarily on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria ready to welcome refugees back, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to allow refugees to return willingly and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al Moualem, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, said that the situation in the country was improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to restore normalcy by rebuilding areas that were once the strongholds of terrorists.
The refugees are now ready to return willingly to the countries they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic policies that threatened their daily lives and jobs.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country are in need of relief.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian authorities would gladly accept help in rebuilding the country.
He stressed, however, that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The 2018 Ryder Cup was won by a European team, defeating the United States by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight games on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team, led by Denmark's Thomas Bjorn, scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, the most difficult player of the tournament, hit his opening shot over the water on the 16th hole, a par 3, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has scored in every game, becoming one of only four players to reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, but he was at the bottom of the European team rankings.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the world's best golfers list, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who was playing in what may be his final Ryder Cup match.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, an eight-time Ryder Cup player, became the tournament's all-time European leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the Cup back.
It's about the team, and I was happy to help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He is the country's John Rahm of the match, but he defeated the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I was incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup competition.
This is an odd result for one of the greatest players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find their footing all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played well throughout the tournament.
Team USA coach Jim Furyk said after disappointment with his team's performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime this morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down there.
I'll take it up for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and we move on.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their leader.
You gotta take it up.
They played better than us.
Breaking news from the pines: density decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
Recent news from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in the density of the pinnipeds in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more worn-out garter blooms have been reported in certain areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting declining density.
The sand dune extends for some 125 miles [200 km] from Pinellas County north to Lee County south.
The unique flowers can be found 10 miles from Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
There have also been reports of thorn blossoms in Pasco County.
Moderate to high density was reported in or near Pinellas County last week, low to high density outside the coast of Hillsborough County, very low to high density in Manatee County, very low to high density in or near the coast of Sarasota County, very low to moderate density in or near Charlotte County, very low to high density in or near the coast of Lee County, and low density in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory distress in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory distress was reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
