Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic guy.
Crowds gather to hear him deliver and heal.
He was in his teens when things started happening in his life that I couldn't explain.
Today, through the Franciscan, others are experiencing it.
The mass of liberation and healing, which Father Witko is conducting, draws crowds.
One day, the parents of a seven-month-old baby came to him with a hole in his heart that was only a quarter inch [7.5 mm] in size.
He was supposed to have surgery.
Father Josef Witko was praying over him.
Later that day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The doctors were amazed and said: "No surgery necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying with joy.
After the Franciscan's next prayer, the hole disappeared completely.
The clergyman began to experience the Creator's wonderful works as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him for help.
I was awakened at night and told to pray for the dead and those who were dying in the moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.
My body started to change.
I lost all human traits and began to take on the appearance of an animal, he says.
An invisible force was lifting him up, and he couldn't get his voice out.
He felt lost.
Then God showed him the way.
"Dipped in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was released and returned to human form... " he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
He was ripening for a calling.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
He did more than preach about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the charismatic community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people attend the healing services that Father Witko holds in the hope of getting rid of the disease.
The minister, however, emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical.
The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
Today (26 September) afternoon, Kolping FRAC team won the championship against the current Polish champion Bogorie Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTTO Super League Table Tennis.
The Jaroslavs, with the lineup they've put together against the Grozny, have little chance of winning against the league champions.
He showed that in a duel with Dart Bogoria.
The team still lacks a team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the squad, the Jaroslavs would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han is not yet old enough to win against the likes of Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowsky.
The competitor from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorsky Street in Jarosław.
Both in the fight against Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei he was a class by himself.
After three matches, Kolping FRAC was leading 2-1.
Kou Lei probably beat Mark Badowsky and Daniel Górak after an exciting five-set fight with Pavel Sirucek.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
There was still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han couldn't match Badowski.
There will be no additional testing for seniors.
Why? Why?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive testing for seniors aged 70 and 80 years was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been approved by the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
The Agency explained in its explanation that the target group had been poorly selected.
These actions may even affect the detectability of individual disease units, which may contribute to greater difficulties in accessing NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result, it said.
The president of the capital doesn't understand the department's decision.
The money is ours, we've planned it.
The government is just afraid that if people get tested, they'll go to the doctor later, which is absurd because it's about getting to a point where prevention can be done faster.
All the professionals know that this helps in terms of the burden on the health system because it helps in the early detection of diseases and in the fair treatment of health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand", said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I can't imagine experts saying, 'Don't get tested, because there will be longer lines at the doctor's, and if such specialists advise the government, I'm not surprised that the health service is in such a state,'" the PO politician added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the country's new government tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's promise to annex the occupied Palestinian territories.
"If the next government of Israel, which will be formed, goes ahead with this plan, we will cancel all agreements signed and withdraw from all commitments", he said.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely", Abbas threatened under pressure.
It is our duty to defend all our rights by all means possible  no matter what the consequences  by fully engaging in action to enforce international law and fight terrorism, said the president of the Palestinian Authority, who made similar statements in July.
Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel, was re-commissioned to form a government after the September 17 election.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would annex the Jordan Valley and incorporate all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also promised to hold a general election in the Palestinian territories during the UN General Assembly.
The last one was in 2006.
"On my return to the country, I will call for local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem and anyone who opposes them will be held accountable to God and the international community", the Palestinian president declared.
Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, which is a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the powers of "full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader ended his speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to fully respect the provisions of the United Nations".
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas's speech, saying the Palestinian leader would rather focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel than fight calls for terrorism in the Palestinian Authority under his leadership.
Danon, however, did not mention Netanyahu's announcement of annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories, the agencies said.
Paramedics want defibrillators in the neuralgia points.
The story from the border crossing shows that an automatic defibrillator AED can save lives.
The Provincial Emergency Medical Service in Przemyśl wants to put these devices in the most vulnerable areas of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Medical Service in Przemyśl.
The applicant Daniel Cyrnek, the senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officials of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemysl.
On August 28, a Polish-Ukrainian border guard at the Medycy border crossing saw a man lying unconscious in a pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died in custody after being tortured.
He wanted to exercise his constitutional rights.
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, received a call on September 23 from the Communist Party secretary from her home village to inform her that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
The cause of death was not disclosed.
At the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body butchered, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood", the woman said.
They wouldn't let me bring my cell phone and there were a lot of police around who wouldn't let me get close to Wang.
The police pressured her to sign a statement saying that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an "accident".
105 million zloty for video game companies from the National Center for Research and Development
Almost 105 million zlotys of funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of GameINN on Friday.
The almost 30 projects supported by NCBR included the development of a real-world mapping AR game engine-based game development platform with an application that allows users to upload data; a test and training platform for the verification of practical workplace skills and professional development using VR and AI; and an innovative simulation game for real production process management using a novel game model based on virtual world interaction with the real world using the Industry 4.0 concept, NCBRAP said in a press release on Friday.
The aim of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game sector on the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10 percent per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the already PLN 300 million in support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme are a major impetus for further dynamic growth of the Polish game industry, the press release says.
The video game industry is a great example of how we can use the potential that we have in Poland.
The government's incentives for entrepreneurs who are innovators, such as R&D incentives, skills development programmes, IP box and support programmes implemented by NCBRs, are driving innovation and enabling them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market, said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the statement.
The head of the science department points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets  three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R & D discount in 2018 than the year before.
The amount of the deductions for R & D activities was PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in savings of over PLN 300 million for the companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN, the Deputy Prime Minister stresses.
The Director of the NCBR, Dr Wojciech Kamieniecki, recalls that in the two previous tenders for funding, worth a total of over PLN 211.2 million, 78 innovative projects were awarded.
The high level of interest in the third call and the diversity of applications show that the video game industry has the ideas and skills to grow and increase its competitive advantage.
It is particularly encouraging that among the projects selected  as in previous editions  are projects on solutions not only for entertainment but also related to Industry 4.0, he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of funding of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, so that 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in co-financing.
Details of the results of the third GameINN competition are available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme shall be implemented under the Smart Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the programme in 2016 in response to an initiative by entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admitted to stealing a watch from Kasper Dolberg.
The incident happened on September 16th.
Dolberg, who had been travelling from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch was missing from his dressing room.
Not just any one, it's worth 70,000 euros.
The next day, the angry Dane didn't show up for class, citing stomach problems.
The case was a mystery from the beginning.
The players have private lockers in the locker room and the clubhouse is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Dane a refund for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.
He arrived in Nice at the age of 13 and made his first-team debut three years later.
He's played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but  according to L'Equipe newspaper  the club will probably terminate him with immediate effect.
He's initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands properly
We all know that we need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before eating).
But what not everyone knows is that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that the autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds for washing to remove harmful bacteria and viruses from your hands
And most of us wash them shorter!
Just warm water and regular soap  it's not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even discourage it).
When washing, rub not only the bottom and top of the hand but also the fingertips (combined or singly)  rub them with circular movements around the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (cross your hands, rubbing your fingers together), the thumbs  each thumb is covered with the other hand and in this embrace, we turn it momentarily to the right and left.
In an emergency (when you can't wash your hands), wipe your hands with a wet towel and then use an antibacterial gel (from $5.00 at the drugstore).
Do not touch the door or the door handle with washed hands after using the public toilet (recommendation of the General Health Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
The Iranian president says he rejected the US offer of talks, Donald Trump denies it
Tehran has not held talks with the US side during the UN General Assembly in New York despite the US offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
US President Donald Trump commented that the Iranian side had asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans have offered to lift all sanctions on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rouhani: Iran will not engage in talks under maximum pressure
The Iranian president said he refused to have the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He said he met with American diplomats because he was being asked to do so by France, Germany and Britain.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not engage in talks under "maximum pressure".
"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be", Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he was not ruling out talks with the United States, and he accused European parties to the nuclear deal of supporting U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran following the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal were a precondition for dialogue.
If we can get past this precondition and if America can lift sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America", he declared.
He added that he did not rule out meeting with US President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a conversation last week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: Iran asked, I said no
Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the Iranian request.
Iran wanted me to lift sanctions on them so we could meet.
Of course I said "No!" tweeted the US president.
Tension with the nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the UK are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran to somehow salvage the 2015 Iran deal they signed.
It stipulated that in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and place the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the US withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed their desire to keep the agreement in force.
So far, nothing has worked.
Washington is using maximum pressure tactics on Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive permission to export the raw material, it will reduce its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw and husband of hatter Emilia, who  according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp  participated in stalking judges, was reinstated on Wednesday by the NSA.
The plea in law states that he has not been disciplined and that there is no reason to maintain the order of Wojciech Mazur, President of the WSA, to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, the disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, opened an investigation against Schmidt in late August, but it has not yet turned into a trial against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the WSA president's decision within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge who publicly spoke about his wife's mental health problems to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office because of suspicions of being a member of a hate group, will return to the courtroom and render sentences on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Schmidt denies any involvement in the hate group.
He claims there's no evidence of that except for the fake screens and the words of his wife, whom he's divorcing.
The other judges with ties to the Kast said the same thing: they're all innocent, there's no proof.
And they're probably gonna go for it.
Because the prosecution has not waved a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, they are also silent about the contents of Emilia Schmidt's phone, which she seized in June in another case.
The police did not shake a finger to secure the devices of the people who were targeted in a February report by Judge Waldemar Żurek.
There is no evidence. There is no Schmidt case. There is no Kasty case.
There's also no case of NIK boss Marian Banasi renting out a house to pimps and hiding his income.
CBA's running his property records.
He'll check when he checks.
And the Committee on Parliamentary Ethics will not deal with Banasi because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee somehow met to make a curious decision to dismiss Banasi's deputies and appoint him as his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
It reminds me of a movie, an American novel, I think, about a wife coming home to find her husband in bed with his mistress.
She's so shocked and devastated, she can't say a word.
She stands at the door, bewildered, and her lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses, and leaves.
And the husband makes the bed.
When the wife gets her voice back and screams, "What is this?"
Who is this woman?
The husband says calmly, "What woman, honey?"
Except that the case of Kasty or Banasi is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.
The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt implementing acts laying down the rules for the application of this Regulation.

Kamilla Lytchwinko in the high jump final
Earlier this season, the bronze medalist from the 2017 World Championships in London, returning to competition after a hiatus, beat 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92.
She didn't get to 6'9" until the third approach.
I'm glad to see you.
I showed I could fight because the first attempt was a complete failure.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically", admitted Lićwinko to Eurosport.
The best finishes in the elimination round were achieved by American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karina Demidik  with 1.94.
Both of them were the only two players who didn't fall off any height.
The women's high jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Start time is 7:30 p.m.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in critical condition.
He's in the hospital, and the doctors say his condition is critical.
I should add that he's conscious and alert.
We believe that it will turn out that he will win again.
We are all praying for his recovery, an anonymous person close to Kornel Morawiecki told reporters at Super Express.
In the upcoming election, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"My closest family and politicians are keeping me alive", Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview with Super Express two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been admitted to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for tests.
I had some strange, disturbing symptoms and I checked into the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was ahead of me.
When the CT scan showed that I had pancreatic cancer... "Oh", the Prime Minister's father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a major operation at the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs hospital in Warsaw.
According to Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was a success.
I know a lot of people have been praying for me, and I thank you so much.
Fortunately, I'm not the one with the metastases.
I don't know if I'm going to get chemo yet.
I'm putting myself in the hands of doctors who are specialists and who are more of a good-natured people.
For now, after this major surgery, I need to get back to some sort of usable state.
I hope everything will be fine', Kornel Morawiecki said in January in an interview with SE.
"If I had given up too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this scoundrel already"...
Krakow: 14-year-old girl is missing
Officers from the Krakow City Police Headquarters are searching for 14-year-old Nel Stoklos.
Anyone with any information about the missing woman is asked to contact us.
She left her home on the evening of September 26 and has not returned or made contact with her family.
She was last seen at Stary Gościniec Street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklos is 14 years old, 5'7", blonde hair and blue eyes.
Last time she was seen, she was wearing a blouse, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone with any information about the missing woman is asked to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of tin jumps.
The title of the report of the amateur sports competition, played on Sunday afternoon, September 15 at the racecourse on Oleandry Street in Oławia, may be confusing for some.
The road to true power is a long one, but that's what they call a kind of horse race...
A power show is a contest in which the rider and the horse overcome increasingly high obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed six feet [2 m].
It is worth noting that the long-standing and still unbroken world record, set in 1949 by Chilean Alberto Larraguibel on Huaso, is 7 feet 8 inches [247 cm].
Of course, no one has jumped that high in Ołwa, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is not among the worst...
The competitions organised by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists In the saddle, were a demonstration part of the Rainbow Horse Racing held there a little earlier, which we write more about in this issue of the newspaper on page 22.
Eight Amazons who trained in the Olav JKS entered the competition.
Four competed on ponytails and four on big horses.
The best of the first group was Nikola Szaldra, riding a crazy Sprinter.
This small but dynamic horse began by overcoming obstacles spread out at a height of 16 inches [40 cm] and ended at a station with a top beam 75 inches [125 cm] off the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and was only disqualified from further competition by the jury after three consecutive rejections.
Amelia Pawlak, riding Fame, took second place in the pony jumping, and Lena Boruń, on the Harmider, took third.
The youngest contestant, Inga Aksman, was ambitious, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small mare Carmen.
Even more exciting was the Amazons and the crowd at the big-horse race.
The most dangerous falls were suffered by Paulina Szewczyk, who was riding the Declaration and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding the Lotce.
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither the Amazons nor the horses were harmed, so they continued to compete.
The young stallion, Vinneta, had a lot of problems getting on the parkour.
She needed either an assistant coach or another steam horse that was being chased by a little crazy Vineta.
After passing the obstacle, she also drove down with a full beam, so it was dangerous in the pits and in the stretcher. "Everything is under control!" said Jan Sienkiewicz, reassuring the frightened spectators, especially the youngest.
Since the start of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska has been doing great on the parkour, riding a beautifully presented Whisky.
This worthy mare, paired with an experienced Amazon, after the second approach in the final stage, first jumped 135 cm and this was the best result at that moment in the competition.
However, after a while, Paulina Szewczyk on the Declaration, Veronika Łuczkiewicz on the Vinet and Anastazja Abramenko on the Lot also scored the same height.
So all the contestants went out together to decorate the flo and to receive the prizes in the form of riding equipment, and finally, together with the Amazons on ponies in the rhythm of the Radecki march, they performed an impressive round of honour, ending this interesting and exciting competition.
Thank you .
The Siodle Equestrian Sports Club would like to thank the sponsors of the 16th Rainbow Equestrian Competition: the Ołwa City Hall, the Ołwa Water and Sewerage Plant, the District Municipality and the Mustang Company.
Max Kolonko is cutting off from KWW Patriotic Revolution
The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which Mariusz Max Kolonka's #R Revolution political party was to run in the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution was aimed at a younger, right-wing voter.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions came to fruition, and even the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko did not manage to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his association with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect the police to cross my name out of the name.
I kindly ask that my person be kept away from the entity mentioned above", he added, adding that more information would be forthcoming.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether this is the end of the #RRevolution formation.
On July 4, the US Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, based in the US, reported the creation of a new political group - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for hosting the YouTube channel Max TV, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
We've had enough of politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It's time for the people to take over the government and rule for the good of the people, Kolonko said.
The party's programme included issues relating to the judiciary (she should be elected in general elections), tax reforms (equalizing the amount of tax-free for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to the countries of the eastern flank of NATO, with particular regard to Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of deputies or introducing single-member constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Mark Jakubiaki.
In late July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions were ever formed.
UBS: Gold close to break-even
The euro will remain at around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, accompanied by weakness in global markets, predicts Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
Expectations of a solid growth rate and a stable monetary policy are conducive to stabilising the zloty at the current ceiling, the expert said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
He said that despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council would not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.
If the zloty is properly valued  the euro should remain around the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months  he believes Polish bonds are not very attractive.
Emerging market bonds offer much better returns than Polish bonds, says Michael Bolliger, head of emerging market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
The global slowdown may continue to worsen, but it should not lead to a severe recession or at most to a slight drop in GDP growth below zero, predicts Michael Bolliger.
Investors should be wary of global actions that could be hurt by the lack of prospects for a resolution of the US-China trade dispute and other geopolitical risks, including the impeachment of Donald Trump and Brexit.
Europe should be the weakest of the stock markets, according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.
Eurozone stocks should perform worse than US stocks because they are more vulnerable to heightened uncertainty around global trade and concerns about a slowdown, the document says.
Michael Bolliger believes that after the boom in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of German 10-year bonds even to minus 0.74 percent, further declines are still possible.
However, in the longer term, the decline in long-term yields should not be limited to short-term yields, as banks ease monetary policy.
The Fed has the biggest field to cut rates, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the coming years.
The long-term break-even point for euro quotes is the $1.29 ceiling, which would represent a potential 19% strengthening of the single currency against the dollar.
We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a reduction in global monetary policy disparities.
Current and budget deficits may not be able to sustain the dollar's strength in the long term, warns Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr is losing weapons.
Confidential report from the German Ministry of Defence
The Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 rounds of ammunition since the beginning of 2014  according to a confidential report prepared by the Ministry of Defence of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The news was reported by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the parliamentary secretary of state in the Ministry of Defence, Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one piece of weapon and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have been recovered so far.
Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 assault rifles, four G36 assault rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 MG3 machine guns are missing.
The situation has been expressed with concern by the deputy leader of the Left Party, Martina Renner.
She told RND reporters that the number of missing weapons and ammunition was "staggering".
Especially since the investigation has only been able to find a small part of the lost equipment.
Martina Renner summarised the effects of these actions as a "balance sheet".
She also criticised the fact that the list does not show whether the weapons found during the investigation against Bundeswehr Lieutenant Franco A. were also there. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe charged him with preparing a serious act of violence that threatened state security and violated the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.
The officer was accused of plotting to assassinate leading German politicians for far-right and racist motives.
Among the people on his blacklist, which was taken over by the prosecutor's office, were then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally entered possession of four firearms, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition and over 50 explosive devices.
Crying babies on a plane.
How can we avoid them?
There is a solution.
Japan Airlines recently introduced a feature designed for people who find it a nightmare to travel with a crying baby.
The airlines can check the seating arrangements on the aircraft via their website.
If a minor is travelling on a flight under the age of two, the child icon appears on a specific seat reserved by the parent or guardian.
The carrier thus has the option of choosing a seat away from the child's seat.
The BBC reports that airlines have already reported the shortcomings of this solution.
The child icon will not appear if the ticket was booked by a third party or if there is a last-minute change of aircraft.
As you might expect, the idea has divided netizens.
Some Twitter users suggest that the problem of traveling with crying babies can be solved with noise-canceling headphones.
They're children, we used to be.
"We must learn tolerance because soon we will need a map of seating for mouth breathing, drooling or drunk people", wrote G Sundar.
Another user remarked that he used to be bothered by crying children on a plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There are also supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children on the 13-hour journey", wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Majorca is counting losses after Thomas Cook 's travel agency went bankrupt .
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not be coming to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, a travel agency, announced Monday.
The Balearic Islands' autonomous government's representative Marc Pons said on Friday that among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of their October holiday in Mallorca are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers who will have to cancel their holidays in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of a British company are from Germany and the Scandinavian countries.
However,  as Pons  argues, since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic Islands between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic Government had already started negotiations with international operators on entry into the Mallorcan market following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that over 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Mallorca.
About 800 of them are laid off employees at Thomas Cook's Palma office.
The rest of the people will lose their jobs, mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, as Thomas Cook declared bankruptcy, many Mallorcan hotel owners demanded that guests pay extra for their accommodation.
This situation was experienced by dozens of tourists from Poland, among others.
The Balearic government estimates that as of Thursday, dozens of hotels in Mallorca have been suspended until at least the end of October following the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its affiliates.
On Friday, the daily Diario de Ibiza reported that most of the hotels in Ibiza that have partnered with Thomas Cook do not plan to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reports that on this Balearic island, a British bankrupt has cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish government for €100 million in aid to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected in the archipelago, some 36,000, are in Majorca.
According to the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook owes local tour operators, mainly hotel operators, around EUR 5 million for the execution of contracts for the period July to September 2019.
The FIFA women's ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA in first place
The Polish women's national team is ranked 29th in the ranking published on Friday by the International Football Federation (FIFA).
In the same position, the team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous, July list.
Weak team matches.
How's October going?
The leaders were the Americans, who had recently defended their world title.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, and the third by the remaining Dutch women.
The Poles are preparing for the ME qualifiers.
They were supposed to start with a home game against the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed by a year because of food poisoning.
In this situation, the Poles will open the qualifiers with a meeting with the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
The Red and White will play two friendly matches on 3 October against Cyprus and five days later against Brazil in Kielce.
The group of Polish rivals includes the national teams of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the three best second-placed teams advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six second-placed teams will play in the knockout stages for the last three European Championship places.
The 16 contestants will be joined by the host nation, England.
The Polish men's national team in the FIFA September ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
Smog has overwhelmed the government
The effects of the Clean Air Programme are poor and the coal-fired furnaces will burn like never before this winter, says the front page of the 'Clear Air' today.
To date, 82,000 applications for funding totalling PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48,000 decisions have been positive.
The total amount of the accepted proposals is over PLN 915 million, Rz reports, citing data from the spokesman for the Ministry of the Environment.
The newspaper notes that only a fraction of the costs are reimbursed.
The results of the highly publicized program are described as "modest".
Local authorities cited by the Government see the failures of Clean Air as too much bureaucracy.
The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, invoicing by post, possible sampling of implementation.
This would improve operations, says Jacek Wiśniowski, the mayor of Lidzbarek Warmiński.
Activists from Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of the campaign, less than 1 percent of the target of replacing 3 million boilers was achieved.
As the Government notes, although the program's budget is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, or PLN 10 billion a year, this amount is virtual.
The budget of the National Environmental and Water Management Fund for this year is just PLN 1.4 billion, we read.
Congress approves F-35s for Poland
Now for the price negotiation.
The U.S. Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35s to Poland.
This is one of the last steps before the contract is signed, but not the end of our work, Mariusz Błaszczak wrote on Twitter.
'We will negotiate hard to get the best price possible', the Polish minister added.
Polish F-35 contract
The Polish Air Force will supply 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US State Department approved their sale to Poland.
The Communication stressed that the investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO ally which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for the fighter jets.
But that's not the final price.
The State Department indicated that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and staffing services and related logistics and program support and staff training.
The Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter
The F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine, fifth-generation multi-role fighter aircraft produced by Lockheed Martin.
The aircraft is capable of close support, bombing and typical fighter air-to-air combat missions.
Thanks to stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable by short-range radar.
Recently, Belgium purchased the F-35 in a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want them to replace the aging F-16s.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also considering buying American fighter jets.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Other, of circular cross-section, of iron or steel
Barbie's manufacturer has launched a line of gender-neutral dolls.
It's a way to fight stereotypes.
Barbie manufacturer has launched a line of gender-neutral dolls
Along with Barbie, a doll with a variety of skin colors, figures and hairstyles, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls.
The toys in the Creatable World series wear wigs.
So kids can decide if their Barbie wants their hair short or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can turn from girls to boys and vice versa.
They also come in a variety of skin colors and clothing styles.
The emphasis on gender characteristics was also dropped:  gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a slim waist, or  in the case of Ken  broad arms.
The company believes that children do not like to see their dolls have gender norms imposed on them, and some parents and feminists believe that gender-specific toys stifle girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will make all children feel free", Mattel says.
Barbie, which was launched in 1959 in a bathing suit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as unnatural body proportions.
The company has responded to criticism and has already launched dolls with different skin colors and more rounded shapes.
There are also hijab dolls.
Zandberg: the circle or club together can have a dozen members
Asked on ZET radio how many candidates from his party can get into the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD, whose list runs candidates for the Sejm SLD, Wiesny and Lewicy Razem, running with the common logo Lewica), Zandberg replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
"I believe the Left will be very good because we feel that people are hopeful that the Left is not only right but also strong", he said.
According to Zandberg, it means that the left can have 60 to 80 MPs.
That means maybe a dozen or so members of the Razem Club.
But that depends on the Poles and the Poles.
I'm not gonna guess and tell how it's gonna happen, he said.
Asked if Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: "We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that diversity does not exist.
I think that Polish people have rewarded this diversity because we have shown that, despite our differences, we can agree on a common agenda.
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint venture is SLD leader Włodzimierz Czarzasta, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the centre-left and left-wing voters.
He also pointed out that the SLD would receive all the subsidies, but he said that the aim of a political party is to represent its constituents.
Zandberg has admitted that he will vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
He said he was considering running for the Senate.
'The offer is diverse and there are candidates who are closer to my heart, but there are also those who are further away,' he said.
"But I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in Senate District 44, I would have taken my ballot and voted in another district", the politician said.
I would not be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO-PAP candidate), he added.
In this district, outside of Ujazdowski, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are running.
Dakar: West Africa's largest mosque opened
Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a massive mosque believed to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot in the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built that can accommodate 30,000 worshippers.
The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a Sufi sect of Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began 10 years ago on a six-hectare wetland donated by the government.
The name of the Massakh-e-Jinan (Paths to Paradise) mosque comes from a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood and revered as a saint by his followers.
The mosque is lined with Karrarian marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque inside can hold 15,000 worshippers, and the other 15,000 can be accommodated on the outer plaza.
The richly finished interiors feature a gilded dome, gigantic chandeliers, and handmade decorations by Moroccan workers.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building is still unmatched by mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 worshippers.
The mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros to build, was financed by private donations.
In addition to land, the government has also financed lighting, sanitation and road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smyla: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The streak of eight league games without a win, the players of the Crown will try to break in the meeting with the vice-leader of the extra class, Silesia.
"Our problem is not Wrocław, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play", stressed the coach of the team Mirosław Smyła.
The last and so far only victory in the league was won by the Korona players in the first round, when they beat the Benjamins of the Częstochowa Cancer 1-0 on the road.
Later, the Kielcans scored two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0-1 to Lubin Zagłębia in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
I'm optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup game, the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall to the ground after the last whistle was not a breakdown, it was a fall of anger because they were so close, said the Brave.
He said that Silesia has very strong wings, so he will make the team feel good about playing in the side sectors of the field.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play", the coach added.
In the game on Friday in Korona, the player who is pausing for too many yellow cards, Ognjen Gnjatic, will certainly not play, the injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be missing.
It's encouraging to see a few players willing to play in a bowl game.
"We have a headache, it seemed not to be there until recently, but now it is", said Smyla.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the belt of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the extra class everyone can win with everyone.
We're a good team.
"We may not have shown it on the pitch in the last few weeks, but there will come a time when we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday", the footballer said.
After nine rounds of the extra-class, the Crown with five points is in 15th place.
Silesia has 12 more points and is in second place.
Friday's game in Kielce starts at 8:30.
These trees could disappear from Europe altogether.
42 per cent of the tree species that make up Europe's forest are threatened, warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red Book of European Trees, published on Friday.
The top of the list are chestnut and blueberry.
The IUCN, based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of Europe's endangered tree species for the first time.
It was prepared by experts who concluded from research that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are 'highly threatened'.
The Red Book lists rapid urban growth and global climate change as reasons.
However, the most endangered are the trees and shrubs that are found only or mainly on our continent.
Of the typical European forest, 58 percent are threatened, and 15 percent, 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction, according to the IUCN.
The Red Book lists the main causes of deforestation as mismanagement, accelerated urbanization, excessive logging, and forest fires and changes in Europe's ecosystem.
The report also says that many European species of shrubs, mosses and lichens are also at risk.
Human activities are leading to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and are threatening the extinction of important and under-appreciated varieties in Europe, which are the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet, summarised Luc Bas, head of IUCN's European Office.
I can't promise you 600+
"Today PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a loan for distribution in exchange for freedom, which future generations will have to pay back", says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with "Rzeczpospolita".
He thinks all PiS politics are drinking.
At the same time, a politician promises that what is given will not be taken away.
Schetyna assures in conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the polls.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than Kaczynski's party.
'Today there are more people who want to live in a normal state than there are PiS supporters, a party that has betrayed its values of modesty, humility, transparency,' says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic assumptions of the electoral program of the KO.
First, nothing given will be taken away, but we need to set a direction for the future, because PiS is only concerned with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which is evident even after dramatically low investments, he said.
Second, it is about rejuvenating the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work hard - and those who are entrepreneurs.
Schetyna explains that the KO program included a project that would give the lowest-earning Poles 614 zlotys more per hand, and those earning more  several hundred.
The politician also made it clear that he did not want to compete for distribution.
Like he said, he'll do what he can, but he can't promise 600+.
'I will never allow the Greek version where the government bids with the opposition for distribution until the country's financial collapse,' he said.
Schetyna also stated in an interview with Rz that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda", he said.
Pride is the road to ruin.
Kaczynski is as much a statesman as Banas is crystal, he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether to run for the Platform presidency.
Argentina: Six large condors are dead
Six large condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz  reports TVN24.
Experts believe human activity contributed to their deaths.
The giant condors were probably poisoned to kill predators like cougars, foxes, and wild dogs.
The animals may have eaten the toxic carcass.
Except for one young, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
This is a big loss for the environment, because the condor has to reach 10 to 15 years of age to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species", says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
"I think the use of toxic bait and poison is putting not only this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health", he adds.
They want a jewel for the president.
Work has begun on awarding the head of state a valuable chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's law firm.
The newspaper says the gold chain is the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic between the wars.
It was last used by President Ignacy Mościcki.
The RZ reports that soon such a chain could be worn by Andrei Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted Wednesday to amend the law on orders and decorations to restore it.
The newspaper says this is not the first attempt to restore the chain of command to the head of state.
The Senate proposed the amendment in 1992, but it was defeated by one vote.
This time, the work is instantaneous.
In early August, the senators took a few minutes to consider the matter, agreeing to consult the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
I kindly inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position expressed in the petition in question, wrote then the Prime Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the case.
"The President's office gave us a short answer: it is in favour of restoring it", said the head of the committee, Robert Mamutov of the Law and Justice party, quoted by the Rz.
He made a proposal to start legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police officers will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be conducted at the intersection of al. Ciepliński and al. Piłsudski.
The uniforms are part of a recent complaint by the city authorities about drivers not always behaving properly at intersections.
On Friday, September 27, police officers in Rzeszów will begin a preventive operation called "Intersections".
It is about eliminating obstacles to traffic: crossing an intersection without a chance to get off, not following traffic lights or road signs.
'We often think we are alone at an intersection, but we are actually making it harder for other drivers', said Marek Ustrobiński, the city's vice-president, a few days ago.
He was speaking at a press conference at the city hall, where city officials presented examples of improper traffic at intersections, which results in traffic jams.
The president then appealed to travelers to be sensible on the road and to move faster at traffic lights and not text while driving.
The issue has been taken over by the police in Ruse, who are starting their "Intersection" operation today.
What's the matter, man?
The aim of the actions is to eliminate the phenomenon of reduced traffic at intersections by drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.
This is a common offense that contributes to traffic congestion and congestion.
He's facing a $300 fine and two penalty points.
In addition, the uniformed will be warned about not following traffic lights or signs and parking in the wrong area at intersections.
They will also monitor for lack of driving fluidity, late start at traffic lights, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
What intersections will be used?
The main streets are: Lisa-Kuli from Jagiellonian Street; Ciepliński from Piłsudski Street; Targowa from Piłsudski Street; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowski Street or Hetmańska from Warsaw's Insurgents Street.
This type of action in the capital of Podkarpaty will be held on the next Fridays of October.
They checked out a waste disposal company in the Czech Republic.
Officers from the Environmental Protection Department of the City of Wołomiń and the District Building Inspectorate inspected on Friday a plant in the municipality of Zielonka, which disposes of waste from the wastewater treatment plant Czajka in Warsaw, said Karol Szyszko, a spokesman for the mayor of Wołomiń.
Inspectors from the Volominskiy City Council inspected the plant in the woods belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
The private commercial and transport company Dar-Trans, under a contract with the capital's wastewater treatment plant Czajka, provides waste management services.
The inspection of the plant was completed and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation on his activities, Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be sent to the Voivodeship Environmental Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last inspection in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Voivodeship Environmental Inspectorate in Warsaw between 29 December 2015  11 February 2016.
It was found at that time that the company had not carried out sampling, measurement and testing of groundwater and that it did not have the results of the tests of stabilised municipal sewage sludge from the Czajka sewage treatment plant.
After the inspection of the WIOC, Dariusz Sobota was asked to stop violating the terms of the decision.
The private trade and transport company DAR-TRANS Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies that collect waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage from the Czajka treatment plant.
According to the decision to dispose of waste at the site, up to 60 000 tonnes of waste are processed annually in the forests around Zielonka.
The Warsaw City Water and Sewerage Company reported on Thursday that the plant was shut down in November and December 2018 due to damage to one of the incineration plants.
As the Ministry of Finance has informed, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1,7 million (calculated on the basis of the export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Walesa has supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
'You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support', Lech Walesa told Ms Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr President, these are very important words for me", said the Civic Coalition candidate for prime minister, leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now just a retired fan.
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa on Friday in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
In the short conversation behind closed doors, Wałęsa's son  Jarosław also took part.
"You have undertaken a difficult task", he said after meeting Lech Walesa.
"You can count on my full support", he added.
The problems facing Poland are well known to all of us.
Therefore, I hope that you as a woman will cope with these problems, and all of us who love Poland will support your efforts to the maximum", the former president said, addressing the Kidawa-Błonska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Blonska thanked you for your support.
"Mr. President, these words are very important to me because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the Constitution and knows how important it is", she said.
Let's show that we can make a different, wise policy, together, but in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
You did your revolution like this, and we want to change Poland like this, Kidawa-Błonska stressed.
Retired cyclist
Walesa told reporters that he is now just a retired fan.
Of course I'm looking into it.
I hope we can turn things around, that what was good, tried, will come back.
The tripartite power is paramount, the constitution is paramount, the courts are indispensable.
And that's all that needs to be cleaned up, that's all that needs to be restored to normal operation, and that's what I believe we're going to do this time.
Because if not, we will face a street test", said Lech Walesa.
That's why it's so important that Poles go to the polls, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important thing", added Kidawa-Błonka.
"The last chance to improve the situation in Poland", the former president replied.
We must rebuild the foundation
Asked what she considered the most important changes to take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "The President said it very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the tripartite power does not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and make everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move forward.
The volleyball players: Slovenia  Poland 3-1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot field in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players faced off against Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championship.
There was no lack of controversy and discussions with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heinen in the lead role.
The Red and White lost 3 to 3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has passed key bills
The Senate passed the Family Property Disclosure Act without amendment, and the Flight of the Nation's Most Important People Act.
The amendment to the Family Property Act of the State of California, without amendment, was approved by 52 senators, 14 against, three abstentions.
The Senators have therefore decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the debate on Wednesday by Senator Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to civilize and limit the scope of information given in the declaration on the financial situation of own children, children of a spouse, children adapted to cases where children remain in the same household with the person obliged to submit the declaration.
The law on disclosure of the assets of the families of key state officials, drafted by the Prime Minister's Office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The legislation provides that the Prime Minister, ministers, members of the European Parliament, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as heads of other state institutions, are obliged to include in their declaration of assets information on the personal assets of spouses, children and persons living together.
The Senate has not proposed amendments to the law on the flights of the most important people in the country.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important people in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
The bill, without amendments, was approved by 55 senators, 12 voted against, and four abstained.
According to the law, any presidential flight is an official mission.
The President will be able to be accompanied on flights by family members and other persons invited by the President.
However, the flight of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate on official mission shall be carried out only for the purpose of carrying out tasks directly related to their functions.
The law also specifies a list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation  invited Members of Parliament, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational support; and journalists may be on board.
According to the law, if there are any doubts about the flights of the Sejm and Senate marshals, the head of the KPRM will ask for their explanation.
If such doubts are not resolved within the prescribed time, the head of the CPRM shall be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate office that it is not possible to organise such a flight.

The Poles after their first training in Paris, waiting for their last opponent
The Polish volleyball team held its first training on Friday in Paris, where they will compete for the bronze medal on Saturday.
The way to win the title for Vital Heinen's team was closed by the defeat of the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana on Thursday.
Word was they were having trouble getting to that duel.
This time, no such problems occurred. On Friday morning, they and the Slovenians boarded a charter plane to Paris, and a few hours later, they trained in the famous Bercy gym.
According to reports from those present at the class, the trainer of the world champions was nervous.
As Heineken's assistant, Michael Mieszko Gogol, noted, the main task this time was not just to practice the volleyball elements.
We went to the gym, but for the most part, it was time for the band.
It was more about spending time together than training.
Talk, figure out how to rebuild it all as a team, report back.
He confirmed that the semifinal defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.
We've been brutally brought down to earth.
We are clearly disappointed.
We kept believing we'd be back for that game.
We discussed this game between us at the headquarters, the coach talked a lot with the players.
The two main reasons for the failure I would point to were ineffectiveness in attack and a much worse than usual handling of situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect, he analysed.
He said the White and Red were not hampered by the stress of playing against the co-hosts, who were supported by a large crowd.
He admitted that the world champions might have been a little sleepy on the smooth way to the semifinals.
Maybe if we had a similar defeat in the group stage, we would have learned a lesson sooner and then played differently in the next round.
But that's only if he's a jerk, he reserved.
Gogol hopes that the anger over the Polish defeat on Thursday will turn into aggression in the bronze match.
I hope we can show our true colors then.
There's a lot to fight for.
The last time we won an ME medal was in 2011, he said.
Paris is the fifth city and France the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two group stage matches they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment but suspended
An Australian tennis player has been banned for 16 weeks and fined $25,000  suspended for six months  for abusive words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour is losing patience with Kyrgios, but they're still giving him a chance to improve.
Summing up the misdeeds of the most unruly professional tennis player in recent years looks daunting  16 weeks of suspension plus a hefty fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months  a probationary period during which the stubborn athlete can improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been playing for a long time and has set a world record in tennis - he had to pay the highest single fine in the history of the sport for violating the rules of conduct on and around the court.
Loud swearing, weird gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and the audience, breaking two rackets during a losing game against Karen Khachanov, all for which he paid $113,000 after the ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati in August.
He didn't play much at the 2019 US Open either, but he did go public with his statement that ATP officials were corrupt, which hurt the organization so much that they launched a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and a few weeks later issued the suspension and a fine.
However, the allegations of corruption were cleared after the accused was heard and the context was understood.
However, in their statement, the tennis activists said that the investigation had shown that Kyrgios' behavior over the past 12 months was in many cases highly objectionable and constituted a near-constant violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted people associated with the tournaments and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately suspended the sentence, ordering him to meet a number of conditions within the next six months: Kyrgios must no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct for professional tennis players in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour, in particular he must no longer swear, destroy rackets, argue with referees and the public, or otherwise behave in an indecent and vulgar manner.
He was also advised to seek ongoing support from mental trainers during tournaments and also to consult with people who specialise in dealing with athletes who are not coping well during the off-season.
Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) to the verdict was: "Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all.
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break because of a shoulder injury he sustained in the Lavera Cup and had to cancel his upcoming starts in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6 - 13 October).
In the ATP rankings Kyrgios is ranked 27th.
He's won two tournaments this year in Washington and Acapulco, earned over $1.3 million, so even with the fines, he's got a lot left.
Life is getting better in Poland
A report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday shows that as many as 44 percent of households rated their financial situation as good or rather good in the past year.
The previous year it was 37,2%, in 2016 it was 33,5% and before that  it had never exceeded 30% since 2009, when the Statistical Office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their financial situation to be poor or worse last year, compared with 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of the self-employed households.
In this group, over 70 percent of respondents considered it to be good or rather good.
At the other end of the scale, there are households of rentiers, where the proportion of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a major influence on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst-off are single parents, with 32 percent of them reporting a good or rather good financial situation.
For couples with children, the percentage ranges from 55 to 60 percent (depending on the number of children) and for households without children, it is 48.8 percent.
The 500+ programme's impact is clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016), single parents and large families (with at least three children) were considered to be the worst off.
The improvement in subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects the rapid increase in income, primarily from work.
But that's not all, because the percentage of households that consider themselves to be in a good situation is growing faster than real incomes.
Moreover, at the level of the provinces, there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of the households.
The best ratings are given by the residents of the Opole region, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
The following are the provinces of Lubus (47.7%), Silesia (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and West Pomerania (47.1%).
In contrast, in Opole, the disposable income (i.e. after taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average in the year before, and in Lubusek, 98%.
The highest incomes were inhabitants of Mazowieckie (120 percent of the national average) and Silesia (104 percent).
The average disposable income per person in Poland in 2018 was PLN 1693.
The Commission established the profitability of the Union industry by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
That's a pretty low number compared to previous years.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While the growth of incomes slows down, it also slows down the growth of spending.
These per capita amounted to PLN 1,187 in the year ended, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
The Commission notes that the increase in real GDP per capita was only slightly higher in the first half of 2017.
Household budget surveys suggest that statistical households now spend 70.1% of their disposable income, up from over 80% in 2014 and over 90% in 2006.

USA: Three crew members commit suicide
Three sailors committed suicide last week aboard the USS George H. W. Bush, the U.S. Navy said.
In the last two years, five crew members have killed themselves on this ship.
The previous suicide occurred in July of this year and the previous one in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of these incidents occurred on land while the USS George H. W. Bush was docked off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the case has excluded third parties.
And the deaths are not to be linked.
The need for everyone to get involved in providing suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
"I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions of seeking help", said Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander, on Facebook.
Niesiołowski is critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lexicki, Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
In fact, every word he said was accepted.
Later, criticism of some of his actions came.
"To me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activities of Rydzyk casts a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist  a pest of the Church and Poland  was developing his media in the best way even during the life of the Polish Pope, he explained.
A former PO politician admitted: "There were murmurs of discontent, the Pope said something, once he did not accept Rydzyk, but he had power and for his politics he could have simply expelled him from the Church or sent him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do so, as did his successors, explained Niesiolowski.
Then there was this fatal case of pedophilia and the Church's activities, or lack thereof.
I was a little forward thinking, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
We've known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church for a relatively short time.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, as head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things, says Niesiołowski in an interview with the journalist.
In the opinion of the former Polish PO politician, the Church is an ally of the PiS.
It must be admitted that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations started with a holy mass, crosses hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are in writing, they've become a symbol of dictatorship  a symbol of the writing regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking up the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
It is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which it will have to pay dearly, Niesiołowski argued.
"I hope Pope Francis will banish Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others like them", he concluded.
Tomorrow is the 590th anniversary of the county.
There'll be a gala concert and an auction.
The gala will be held at the Hrubieszow House of Culture.
First, at 10 a.m. in the church of St. Nicholas, the Mass of St. Nicholas will begin.
The official opening ceremony will be at 11:30 at the HDK.
The Hrubieszowska Land Song and Dance Band will perform.
The youth of the Stanisław Staszic Theatre will present a performance entitled "The Grubieszowski District: That's where my family comes from.
Then the medal for Merit to the County of Grubice will be awarded.
At 4 pm the event will move to the city pedestrian zone, where the concerts of Hrubieszów will be held for charity for Angelika Zińkiewicz.
The bands playing are disco polo bands  NoLimit, Malibu, Energy Girls and tonight's star, Mig.
There will be an auction for the pen and china of the Prime Minister.
The NFL is pouring penalties for stadium messes.
Gryffindor disqualified
The match between Grif Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk in the Polish Cup did not end tragically when the goal scored by Wejherowo fans passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic by millimeters.
After the incident, the game was suspended for 20 minutes.
The NFL Commission investigating this case has issued a severe punishment to Griff, banning him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
And the fans will not be allowed in their own stadium for the next game.
They also won't be able to travel to league games in groups until December 31st.
The burds at the Widzew Łódź Stadium also caused the fans of Śląsk Wrocław.
However, the PZPN's judgment was milder here, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities on this issue.
Nevertheless, the police allowed the throwing of rackets at the Lodz fans, the burning of chairs and the forced entry of the hosts.
The game was stopped for eight minutes and the police intervened with a water cannon.
The PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The travel ban also covers the league matches of the Extra-Class, but it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to replace the signage on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
The GDDKi of the Rzeszów
In the Podkarpaty region, the implementation of the amendment of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, the writing of foreign city names on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, a lion will appear next to a lion.
In our province, changes will be made to 94 road signs set on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, more readable and simpler.
The new guidelines are the result of the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
It should be noted that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often have Polish sounds.
Thanks to a change in the law we've prepared, they'll finally be on the road signs.
The introduction of the new marking starts from the subcarpathian section of the A4 motorway, the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk informed.
In the Podkarpathian region, changes will be made to 94 road signs set up along the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
I got $200,000.
The new signage will first be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned to be completed by 1 November 2019.
What do you want to see the idea come to fruition?
It's a non-plate replacement, stickers only.
They will replace the existing names of towns with new ones written in Polish on the existing signs.
Both names shall be written in one line  first in Polish and then in the original in brackets.
This will be a great help for people who do not know how to spell the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot the swans with a windmill.
In the pond in Zamecznie in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with wing problems.
After a hunt and a visit to the vet, it turned out that someone had targeted the animal.
Information about the injured bird was received from the villagers at the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Nowy Sol.
The report said the animal had broken wings.
We're on our way.
It was immediately obvious that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and carefully to avoid harming him and putting him under additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first MRI, it was clear that someone had used it as a target.
There were shrapnel fragments in his body, says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, a company that runs a rehabilitation center.
He'll catch cold in the facility.
The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the centre where it will spend the winter.
We're trying to make it stronger.
He's not in a position to fly yet.
Releasing him now would mean he would most likely not survive the winter, Walasek adds.
The staff, after the swan underwent rehabilitation, plans to release him to the same pond in the spring.
The authorities of the municipality of Żukowice, after receiving information about the cause of the animal's poor health, intend to inform the prosecutor's office.
The incident happened in Zamechno.
We need to stimulate Polish small business.
An effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, we will have to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade, said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, and Leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.
Gowin, speaking on Signals of the Day on radio Unitka, said that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually grow.
Noting that the problem was very difficult to combat, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but was met with opposition from the EC.
"We won in the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and forms a government, we will return to this issue", he said.
He also pointed out that an effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, namely small trade.
"We will have to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Gowin.
In May, the EU Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission had erred in finding that the Polish retail sales tax constituted illegal public aid.
The Act on Retail Sales Tax provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to be implemented from September 2016.
The Commission initiated an infringement procedure against Poland in September 2016.
Brussels argued at the time that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It then claimed that the tax had been unlawfully introduced.
It also ordered the suspension of the tax until the examination by the officials in Brussels was completed.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax was suspended.
The May ruling by the EU court opened the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the CJEU informed the PAP that the case is now at the written stage, with both the European Commission and the Polish Government presenting their written arguments.
It is not yet known if and when the oral procedure will begin, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible trial.
It takes a good few to a dozen months from the appeal to the verdict.
Such proceedings take an average of a year, a source at the Luxembourg Court told the PAP.
How do you dress a baby for baptism?
We're putting together some practical solutions.
Baptism is a very important event in the life of an infant and its parents.
Often, it is the first time that the whole family gathers around a child to celebrate his arrival.
No wonder then that freshly baked mom and dad want their consolation to look its best on that day.
Before you make a final decision about what your child will wear, though, consider whether it will be comfortable.
The stores are full of costumes that do not provide the child with the necessary comfort.
What, then, should we be aware of?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptism dress is the age of the child
Until recently, babies of a few weeks were baptized, dressed in white kits and placed in the same baskets or large cushions.
Today, children who receive the sacrament are often older, months, years, or even more.
It's not hard to see why such a comfort needs a different baptism garment.
So if your child is 3 or 4 months old on the day of his baptism, he will likely spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the arms of his parents or godparents.
The best solution is to furnish him with comfortable cotton sleeping bags or sleeping suits.
Although this item of clothing is considered to be an everyday garment, it is enough to look for festive variations, such as a falbank or a crown.
The perfect boy would be a booty with a fly and a scarf print.
For older children, you can afford to have more imagination in clothing.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, silk dress
Many parents of girls look forward to the richly decorated, fancy-colored christening dresses complete with coats, belts, and hats.
Unfortunately, many manufacturers use artificial, nonbreathing materials that make a child uncomfortable.
If you are looking for a suitable outfit, you might want to check out Asanti for Kids, which offers stylish cotton-lined outfits.
Delicate, silk skirts, satin dresses, crowns, apps, and cute outfits will make your little girl look and feel beautiful.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit.
Until recently, the fashion for parents of boys was to wear suits that were a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and pants, stiff collars and caps often made the young stylists loudly protest.
Today, fortunately, they've been replaced by comfortable, cotton suits.
Just look at the kits available at Asanti for Kids, which are soft, tight-fitting shorts and a blouse decorated in the front like a vest.
These costumes look very festive, but they do not hinder the movement of the youngster as he explores the world.
Krystyna Pavlovich has published her statement of assets
Krystyna Pavłowicz filed a statement of assets at the end of her term.
It shows that the PiS MP has accumulated 110,000 zł of savings.
Let's remember that Pavlovich announced her retirement from politics.
At the end of his term, he has 110 thousand zł.
According to the statement made by the MP, she receives a pension of 4,7 thousand PLN per month.
Pavlowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 thousand and a little smaller, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at 150 thousand PLN.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published the statement of assets.
Voting on the break in the proceedings for the Conservative Party conference
British MPs have voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, as requested by the government.
The vote was 289 to 306.
The House of Commons usually does not hold a debate during party conferences, so that Members do not have to give up either their participation in them or the parliamentary sessions.
However, opposition parties have said that at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK's scheduled exit from the European Union on 31 October, parliament should not be suspended.
The government's motion for a recess was supported by 289 MPs, 306 against.
Two opposition parties already at the convention
The refusal to allow a recess could be seen as political revenge by the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (which was declared illegal and unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on Tuesday) and for refusing to apologize after the judges' ruling.
Following the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with Johnson's speech and the ensuing heated debate the highlight of the day.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding an early election.
It's time to get Brexit done.
It must be done to respect the referendum result.
Brexit must come so we can deal with the priorities of citizens, health care, the cost of living.
Brexit must be achieved so that we can unite this country, Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.
The conferences of the two main opposition groups  Labour Party and Liberal Democrats  have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave for the long suspension of parliament was because of party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of the Israeli leaders", foreign media reported.
The president's spokesman has strongly denied these reports.
"This is simply not true", wrote Błaży Spychalski on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, reported that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with Jewish diaspora representatives at the Polish consulate in New York, said that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to anti-Polish rhetoric by Israeli leaders.
He referred to Israeli Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz, who said in February that "Poland sucked anti-Semitism in with its mother's milk".
Andrei Duda said he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating remarks made by its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Marko Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted "Polish, Polish".
The quote is not only inaccurate.
This is simply not true, wrote Błaży Spychalski on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
According to Spychalski, the portal was invented by him.
According to JI interlocutors, there was also a dispute during the meeting between Holocaust survivor and Order of Merit Commander Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was supposed to agree with President Duda's words and say that it was Jews from Israel such as Israel Katz who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach's sources, he was supposed to interrupt Mosberg's speech.
Who is Banas and what did he do?
A house rented by pimps led a journalist to discover negligence in the financial statements of Mariano Banasi.
To sum up, another scandal that has shaken the ruling camp.
TVN's Supervizjera  journalists revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Control Chamber, has not included in the declaration of assets of a 400-meter-high apartment building located in Krakow's Podgórze in recent years.
Moreover, his tenant was supposed to be running a sex business in the building (i.e. renting rooms by the hour).
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the financial situation of the company.
The irregularities were brought to the attention of Bertold Kittel on the Supervisor programme.
The journalist revealed that Banasi's apartment building was rented by people with ties to the criminal world to use as a place for erotic meetings.
The clients were supposed to be men who used the services of prostitutes.
Banas' answer to the accusations was vague and vague.
Interestingly, the pimps' rented apartment led the reporter to discover negligence in Banasi's property statements.
The house itself was described in a vague way and the rent was to be reduced.
The estate of Mariano Banasi and his wife is worth between 6 and 8 million.
In total, the couple can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...], Money.pl writes.
And according to the portal's analysis, Banasia's house was worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting a review of the financial statements of Marian Banas for the years 2015-2019.
Banaš announced that he would suspend his activities at the NIK until it was completed.
The opposition demands an explanation.
We've heard nothing from the CBA about expanding their investigation or speeding up the investigation into Mariano Banasi's financial statements.
Therefore, we are forced to hand over to the state authorities and file a notice of the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said PO-KO MP Mariusz Witczak.
'If a normal Pole were to put such a grossly low price on his rental property, he would already have 10 inspections, a tax haven and a criminal investigation', he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Control Chamber.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019 for a term of six years.
His candidacy was announced by Law and Justice and voted for by politicians from that party.
Earlier Banaś was associated with NIK in 1992-2005, he worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first governments of the PiS (20052008), Banaś held the position of President of the Customs Service and also Deputy State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance.
He was appointed as the Head of the Customs Service in 2015 and as the Head of the National Tax Administration in 2017.
Banaš served as finance minister in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.
Cooler Master is launching a graphics card holder
Now, graphics cards can weigh a lot of weight these days, and that naturally makes room for categories of products that you wouldn't have looked for on store shelves a decade ago.
This is exactly the solution  the handle for the ELV8 RGB graphics card  introduced by Cooler Master.
The new graphics card holder is not only a functional solution to make the graphics card more reliable to hold without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
The Master ELV8 RGB Cooler also has an additional  decorative function.
"Ignoring the orders of a police officer will be punished"
According to the newspaper, a police officer's disregard for a behavior order is a new type of offense that can result in fines, arrest, or imprisonment.
The police union wants to make that change.
The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
The case is serious, as more than half a million offences are now brought before Polish courts every year.
The Republic has decided that the petition the Independent Police Officers' Union is writing to MPs to amend the Offences Code has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose a new wording for Article 54a of the Offences Code.
It should read: Whoever does not obey the demand or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the law, shall be liable to imprisonment, a fine or a restriction of liberty.
"Paragraph 3 of the law provides for the same punishment for those who, by not following orders, prevent or hinder the performance of a service activity", the newspaper said.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that while he agrees with the main message of the proposed rule, he fears that if implemented, it could be used for political manifestations.
In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be detrimental and, instead of alleviating the situation, would exacerbate it, he adds.
The statistics reported by the newspaper show that 86 percent of citizens rated the police interventions in 2018 positively and that the police are taking 1.5 million interventions in the city every month.
Buras is worried about Europe .
Jáchym Topol has writing in his blood.
His ancestors include editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today listed alongside Václav Havel.
So from the beginning, the curse of the talent was on Jehoiakim, and he tried to use it.
After eight years, he came back with "Sensitive Man".
The main characters are Buras and Sonja with their two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They're traveling actors, traveling around Europe.
He's a Shakespeare lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who can't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys was born without a sound, and the other boy stopped in infancy.
But the heroes aren't the most important thing in this story.
They are all just a backdrop for a world where there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of crowded provinces, a society of old, suspicious people and debauchery.
A sensitive man sometimes turns into a ridiculous theater.
The narrative is a didascalia, and the conversations of the characters create this world.
The stage is Europe, full of fears about its future but also of endless questions about its past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights because of Thomas Cook's bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has gone out of business, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is still operating.
The company is in trouble.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that it would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but vacationers will be able to get their money back.
The court in Ghent also declared three Belgian subsidiaries bankrupt: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, some 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy of its UK parent company, which had caused concern amongst employees and customers.
The office was reassuring that customers who bought tours from it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest and largest travel agency, declared bankruptcy overnight.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of last-ditch negotiations with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million bailout agreed in August, the company raise an additional £200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
But the company's problems have been mounting for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

I don't think Slovenia played fantastic.
We were the ones who played very poorly.
This tournament is not over for us yet, said the captain of the Polish national volleyball team, Michał Kubiak, after losing to Slovenia 3-3 in the semi-finals of the European Championship.
Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for an opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion  This is an unusual offer from the German company Görlitz.
The measures are intended to help combat the city's declining population.
Görlitz is the most easterly city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel-colored old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian reports, the city is facing significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them fled to the west, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it was 54,000 people.
To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of offering free monthly housing in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received for the programme.
Two thirds of these were in the big cities.
The program also attracted interest from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States, and Britain.
"When we applied, we thought that the programme would convince people to move to Görlitz", said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not", he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant housing units and the unemployment rate is three times the national average.
Although the city hopes that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from the participants.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalize smaller German cities.
'We want to know more about what people need and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,' said programme manager Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents by offering incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such a system is used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, to Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S.A.
