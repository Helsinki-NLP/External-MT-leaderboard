Welsh Assembly Members are concerned about 'sitting like idiots'
Some Assembly Members are panicking at the proposal to change their title to 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was prompted by a plan to rename the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the move will invite ridicule.
A Labour Party assemblyman said his party was concerned that "the name has a similar pronunciation to TWP and PWP".
For the readers outside Wales: in Welsh TWP means stupid and PWP means stool.
A Plaid PM said his group as a whole was "not happy" and they suggested other names.
He commented that his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but that it was a short vocabulary jump from MWP to Muppets.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter W is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the law to bring about the name change, said: "The final decision on the description of what the Assembly members should be called will certainly be discussed among the members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public opinion poll, which received broad support from the public for the Assembly to be called the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of Assembly Members, the Commission has favoured the names Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the name MWP has received the most support in public opinion polls.
It is clear that Assembly members are proposing other names, but the struggle to reach a consensus will be a headache for presiding officer Elin John, who is expected to submit a draft law on the change in the coming weeks.
The Act on Amendments will also include other changes related to the manner of functioning of the Assembly, including disqualification of Assembly members and design of committee system.
When the bill is being debated, the members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what to call themselves.
Macedonia prepares to vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote is set to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece over its own province, Macedonia.
Athens had long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represented a claim to territory, and had repeatedly rejected its bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Saayev, argue that the name change is only the price of membership in the European Union and NATO.
As the church bells of St. Martin's fell silent, the churches of Harlem were in distress.
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr Adams said.
"Today there are no two".
He says it's understandable that the bars are gone.
"Nowadays, people interact with each other in a different way", he said.
"People no longer have living rooms in bars to go to on a regular basis".
In the case of churches, he worries that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leadership hopes, "sooner or later they will be back where they started".
He added that apartment buildings with rented rooms filled with people of the type that do not help the biotechnology centres in the area can be built as an alternative to churches.
"The majority of people who buy rental rooms in these buildings will be white", he said, "so the day when all the churches close together will accelerate this, because most people who move into these rental rooms are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations, Harlem became a black hell later, Harlem a metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The first white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that used to worship nearby gave the building its name.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the Congregation of Black People under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of small businessmen on 125th Street because the street, a major place for shopping in Harlem, was opposed to hiring or encouraging black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the building, and they commissioned Carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly called Carillon the "Bell of the Poor".
In July, the scholar who read Carillon described it as something else: "a cultural treasure", "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This was the first carillon ever read by a black musician, according to Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan. Dionizio A. Lind was a black musician who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mary Weather said St. Martin's couldn't find anyone else to replace him.
A complex story has been heard at St. Martin's over the past few months of architects and contractors, some of whom have been brought in by the church's minority leadership, and some by the Episcopal diocese.
The Vestry, the governing body of the parish, which includes Alma leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about their concerns, saying that the diocese should "pay" the Vestry, although the Vestry had nothing to do with hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A shark injured 13 lobster divers in California.
On the opening day of the Konch season, a 13-year-old boy was diving for Konch on Saturday when he was attacked by a shark and injured, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. on Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
While diving in the sea with friends for about half an hour on Sunday morning, Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he heard a boy screaming for help and that friends came to him and pulled him out of the water.
At first, I thought the boy was making noise because he was excited about the sting, but then I thought, 'I've been bitten!
"I was bitten", he said, "and I realized later that he was screaming".
"His entire thigh was torn open", Hammel said, which caught his attention when he found the boy.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hummel.
The child was airlifted to San Diego Rady Children's Hospital, where hospital officials say the boy is in critical condition.
It is unknown which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gills told the media that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago but was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Gills added that the child had shock injuries on the upper body.
For investigative - security purposes, the authorities have closed the entrance to the Swami in Nesinitas from Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours.
Gills noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area but they are not considered to be threatened.
Sainsbury's to capture the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is set to take on the likes of Boots, Super Drug and Debenhams by opening department store-style beauty shops that employ specialist assistants.
As part of its focus on the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, Sainsbury's plans to open Beauty Eyelets in 11 stores across the country, and if this proves successful, it will open Beauty Eyelets in more stores next year, despite a downturn in sales of fashion goods and home appliances in the UK.
The investment in the beauty sector is part of the efforts of supermarkets to take advantage of shelf space used for TVs and microwaves.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of cosmetics products to 3,000 products, which would include for the first time the Revlon, SC, Twizerman and Dr. Papou brands.
Current product lines such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Buttsbee's will also have more space with similarly branded spaces, as seen in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is once again introducing a boutique makeup range, with most products being vegan friendly, which is the type of product most demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second of which will be operating in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
We are now seeing a trend of online shopping and buying daily food in small quantities from local convenience stores, which means that there is a lot to be done to get people to visit supermarkets.
As supermarket chains compete against discount establishments such as Aldi and Lidell, which sell more services and non-food products, outlets will increasingly become like department stores, said Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's.
Sainsbury's is opening Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has introduced Habitat outlets in many stores, both of which were acquired by Sainsbury's two years ago, which the company says has increased grocery sales and made the acquisition of the chains more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp the beauty department and pharmacy department was a failure.
Sainsbury's had tried a joint venture with Bootsum in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended amid disputes over sharing revenue from chemist stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's's 281-store pharmacy stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds would also play a role in the project, adding a unique range of high-end skincare brands including La Roche-Pauze and Vichy to its four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have radically changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the environment for customers.
We have also invested heavily in hiring specially trained helpers to provide advice and guidance.
Our range of brands is designed for all needs, and the attractive atmosphere and convenient locations mean that we are now becoming a beauty destination that challenges the old ways of shopping and is indispensable for customers".
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11m deal
The star was angered when TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 deal with the lifestyle brand business of Dragons Den star Peter Jones to focus on deals with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to spend on Truly, a brand of home accessories.
People compared the pair's business to the group brand of Gaineth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old morning anchor announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's last-minute withdrawal from the lucrative lifestyle brand business angered Dragons' Den star Peter Jones - who pulled out of the deal to focus on his new big deals with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Those close to Jones revealed that he was angered when the golden girl on TV agreed at a tumultuous meeting at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that he had no time to devote to the homewear and accessories brand Truly because of the new contracts - £1.5 million.
The world has compared their business to the Goup brand of Gaineth Paltrow, and if they had stayed in business, Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune would have doubled.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to go to one of her holiday homes.
One news source says: "Truly, Truly has been one of Holly's priorities for a long time.
It was a long-term venture that could have helped Holly financially for the next decade or two.
Holi's decision to withdraw has shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because the launch of the initiative was soon to take place.
At Marlowe Headquarters, there's a warehouse full of merchandise for sale".
With a large investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to textiles and homewear, experts believe the withdrawal of the Morning Star, one of the most financially viable stars in the UK, will be a huge liability for the company and the launch could be delayed.
This withdrawal would mean the end of their long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin Jones, and his wife, Tara Kapu, had been friends for over ten years.
Willoughby Truely was launched in 2016 alongside the coffee house, with 52-year-old Jones joining as chairman in March.
The couple often vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Andy McPartlin, the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
Sources close to Jones commented last night, "We don't comment on his business dealings".
After a good fight, we fell in love.
He mocked criticism from the news media for making comments that some considered "un-presidential" and for raising hopes for the North Korean leader.
Why did the president let it go so fast?
Trump jokingly said, imitating the voice of the "news anchor".
"I have left nothing behind".
Trump said he praised Kim's interest in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament talks are stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ring Yo-ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "significant response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
He said the US is instead continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump shared a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea", he said.
"We were sitting in a war zone with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a good relationship now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results, such as halting rocket tests, helping to free hostages and repatriating the remains of US servicemen.
He justified his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to talk the way the president should talk, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside in this confined space, we're going to have about 200 people standing here right now", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated an island, killing hundreds.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they are clear that international assistance should not be sought, which is a bit challenging", Ms Sambang said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign officials will be able to work there.
Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to decide whether to allow international agencies to contribute to relief efforts, said NDA spokesperson Shri Sutopo.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia has to experience, the country still remains unprepared to face the natural disaster.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Asiha, it is not a common sight on other beaches.
Despite the warning being in effect, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu could increase the loss of life.
Even in the best of weather, travel to many of Indonesia's islands can be challenging.
Natural disasters make freight transportation more complex.
The hospital ship, which was docked in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims, has now set sail for Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the new disaster site.
During the election campaign, President Joko Widodo announced that he would improve Indonesia's critical infrastructure, but he spent his money on roads and railways.
Mr. Joko is up for re-election next year, but his lack of money has made his administration miserable.
Mr Joko has also faced pressure from the lingering sectarian issues in Indonesia, where the country's Muslim majority prefer to follow a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were left homeless after Christian gangs and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets with knives, bows, arrows and other deadly weapons.
See: Consolation goal by Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute of the game at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Zordon Shakiri when he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal post, at which point Liverpool were 1-0 down.
Sturridge's ball hit him on his left side before he hit the post.
This effort caused the ball to fly over the box and slide towards the right upper part of the net.
The ball fell on the body of the leaping Kepa Arisabalaga and finally shook the net.
"I was trying to be in that position to get the ball, and always a player like Shaq is going to push the ball as far forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible", Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Khan coming running, I touched one of the balls, and then without much thought, I took the shot".
A goal from Belgian Eden Hazard in the 25th minute gave Chelsea a 1-0 lead at half-time.
In that match, the Blues striker turned almost in the middle of the field and gave a pass to Matteo before Liverpool rushed into the half.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic took a quick give-and-go pass.
Then he led Hazard into the box, giving Kovac a nice throw ball.
Hazard, running through the line, hit the ball with his left foot, and the ball went over Liverpool's Alison Becker.
In the group stage of the Champions League, Liverpool will face Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday afternoon at 15:00.
Chelsea will face Videotone in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Several people are reported to be trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, with waves rising as high as 20 feet following the quake, agency spokesman Sutupo Parvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is scattered among the rubble of collapsed buildings.
The woman with the knife is dead, and the police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body in Brickenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of the 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7.55am in Grayson Museum, John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have requested that anyone who has seen or heard anything abnormal in the area come forward to provide evidence.
Detective theft inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I would ask anyone living in and around John Street in Brickenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to come forward to provide evidence.
I request everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us and see if any footage may have been recorded on the dash cam footage of the drivers, as such information may be crucial to our investigation.
The body was discovered by a Brickingham resident and his body was found inside a property, police said.
Friends who believe they know the deceased woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where the body was found.
Police said that the investigation is ongoing and they are ready to inform the relatives and friends of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Moose tried to get into his flat, but people were blocked from entering or leaving the building, police said.
The taxi driver was stunned when he found out what had happened.
Residents have now been told that it will take hours for access to the building and outside to be restored.
I heard someone say the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was seen crying at the scene.
They kept saying, 'It's terrible.'
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
A handful of police officers were watching the block of flats from inside the cordon.
Anyone with information is requested to email @MerPolCC directly or call 101 or call CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with the log '247 30 September'.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament has been the latest monument to be demolished in a 'distorting history' controversy.
The removal of Cromwell's statue should be called poetic justice because England's cultural relics and religious artifacts were destroyed by his fanatical Puritan followers, as the Taliban did.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "stupid" and an "attempt to distort history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, commented: "The current debate about the removal of the statues was that it was imperative that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace should be the target.
The pagan incidents during the English Civil War were never ordered by Cromwell, and Cromwell never did.
The wrong Cromwell is now being sacrificed for the events of the previous century by his predecessor, Thomas Cromwell.
The magnificently crafted Cromwell statue of Sir William Hamon Thonycroft is proof of the nineteenth-century opinion of Cromwell and part of the history of a leader many still consider worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps many, in the late nineteenth century as having protected the Palace from pressure from outside forces during his monopoly.
Whether it is a complete and accurate representation is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
It is clear that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the course of our nation's development and that Cromwell is the recognized individual leader of one of the two factions that fought to divide it.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered".
A pig killed a Chinese farmer.
Local media report that a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man known as 'Yuan' was killed and found with his arteries broken and bathed in blood near a pigsty in a market in Lyupanshu, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares vaccines for pigs in a pigsty in Sining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2001.
He reportedly arrived with a relative from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell his 15 pigs in the market.
He was found dead the next morning by his relatives, and a pig was found lying unconscious nearby.
Relatives say there was a big pig in the cage, bleeding from its mouth.
According to the forensic report, the farmer was beaten to death by a 550-pound pig.
The man, who was called 'Wu', was quoted as saying: "My cousin's legs were covered in blood and his legs were in a state of dismemberment".
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market to feed pigs at 4:40 am on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that attacked the victim was not his own or his family's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking it, while police collected evidence from the scene of the murder.
Reports suggest that negotiations are underway between his family and market authorities for compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been documented before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured in the attack.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer was pushed into a 650-pound pig tractor, and his wife was scared of the pig and saved the farmer.
In 2012, a Manitoba man who learned of a farmer in Oregon who was killed and eaten by his pigs told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood may be a 'motivator'.
"They're playing.
They're intrusive, very inquisitive, and they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect", the farmer said.
Heavy rainfall is expected to spread across the southwestern United States as part of the end of Hurricane Rosa.
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves up into the cold ocean areas of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern US in the coming days.
Rosa, which was estimated to be a Category 1 hurricane with a speed of 85 meters per hour as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move south by Sunday.
Meanwhile, a cloud cloud has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward and reaching the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push heavy tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Monday, Rosa will rain 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, the interaction of tropical moisture and an approaching cloud cloud will cause heavy rainfall across the southwest in the coming days.
1 to 4 inches of rain, causing locally dangerous flash flooding and landslides, and potentially landslides in the desert.
In some places, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, heavy tropical humidity can cause rainfall of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour.
In the southwest, especially over Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected.
The scattered nature of tropical rain is likely to cause flash floods as conditions deteriorate quickly.
It is strongly advised not to go to desert without vehicle protection when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains will turn the mountain slopes into torrential streams, and thunder and lightning will create locally unpredictable winds and dust storms.
The approaching clouds will bring heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coast.
Over half an inch of total rainfall is expected, which may cause minor landslides and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region this season.
Tropical showers will reach Arizona on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, and will become heavy rainfall on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread in four directions on Tuesday and continue till Wednesday.
The Arctic Ocean is cooling but the tropical wave is really hot and continues, so extreme temperature changes will be experienced across the US in October.
Sometimes this can lead to dramatic temperature variations over short distances.
A prime example of dramatic temperature fluctuations across the central US on Sunday.
Temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, and Nebraska and between St. Louis, Des Moines, and Iowa are about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the dormant summer heat will begin to rise and expand again.
October is expected to start with heat in most of the central and eastern US, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast, widely felt.
New York City's temperature could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the western US through the first half of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial was watched by over 20 million viewers.
The Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who was accused by six television networks of sexually assaulting her in 1980, were seen by more than 20 million people.
Meanwhile, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for a last-minute twist on Friday, political parties continued to distance themselves on the issue; the twist was a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had been caught at a high school party and tried to undress him.
Cavanaugh testified in his heartless testimony that he was 100% certain that nothing like that had happened.
On Friday, Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people watched it.
The company has calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership information from the Met networks that broadcast this news, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, is not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen has technical difficulties in taking the number of people sitting in offices watching TV.
If you think about it, it has the same audience size as people watching a football game or an Academy Awards ceremony.
Fox News Channel's commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, which, during the full day of the trial, led to an average of 5.69 million viewers across all networks, Nielsen said.
ABC is in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said that CBS received 3.1 million viewers, NBC received 2.94 million, MS NBC received 2.89 million and CNN received 2.52 million.
Public interest in the case continued to rise after the trial.
Flake was the star of Friday's dramatic events.
The office of the moderate Republican released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, and CNN and CBS cameras captured him shouting slogans as protesters tried to climb the elevator to a judicial committee hearing on Friday morning.
CNN was live-streaming a scene where he was looking down for several minutes as people spoke angrily to him.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said a woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
"You have power when many women are powerless", someone told him.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and he had more to say at the committee meeting, before the elevator door closed.
Later, as the committee voted to decide whether to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote, it was broadcast live by all cable networks and broadcast networks.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would announce the charges against the nominee next week, which is what the minority Democrats are demanding.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Kruns and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was powerful because it was clear that the Republican Party did not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has requested an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM says critics of Brexit are 'playing politics'
In an interview with the Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of 'playing politics' on Britain's future and of putting the national interest at risk.
Prime Minister Theresa May is attending the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29th September 2019.
The same front page as Theresa May's interview also featured an interview with Theresa's former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who in the interview, called the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other 'a total sham' and reinforced his attack on Theresa's 'Checkers Plan for Brexit'.
Dayton Simpson, suspected of being responsible for the death of LSU star, has been arrested by police.
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade De Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department said that Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities have released video footage of the confrontation between Simpson and Simpson, who lost his glasses during the beating, police said.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene of the murder, and Simpson's DNA samples were found on them, reports WAFB, CBS' sister network.
When Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wade.
His lawyer reports he's being held in a $350,000 bond.
A preliminary report was released Friday by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office, which stated that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU ATLETIC Director Joe Aleva thanked law enforcement authorities in the area for their "vigilance and efforts for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Upon learning of Wade's death, LSU basketball coach Will Ward said Friday morning that the team was "broken" and "in a great state of shock".
"This is what you worry about all the time", said Ward.
Volcanic ash spat out in Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital city.
The National Center for Disaster Management warned residents of Mexico on Saturday to move away from the volcano after the volcano became active and recorded releasing gas and ash for more than 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring multiple noises and companies.
Like Xochimilco, images of people with thick ashes on the windows of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City were circulating on social media.
In September 2017, geophysicists noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence election polling year
Six people were arrested in Barcelona following clashes between pro-independence protesters and police, with thousands taking part in protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's split vote in relation to leaving.
The police action followed a mob of pro-separatist, masked protesters who threw eggs and sprayed police with powder paint, creating black clouds of dust in streets normally crowded with tourists.
The police used batons to quell the fight, which led to a stampede in the streets.
While pro-independence groups chanted "never forget, never forgive" for several hours, unionist protesters chanted "long live Spain".
Local media reported that 15 people with minor injuries were treated in the protests.
A year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but Catalans who support secession celebrate the referendum, tensions remain high in the liberal-minded areas.
Although the majority of voters supported independence, the turnout was low as most of those opposed to partition abstained.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were struck by lightning and injured in clashes that took place when police tried to disrupt polling stations across the region.
Pro-freedom groups camped out all night on Friday to block a demonstration in support of the National Police.
Although the demonstration went ahead, the protesters were forced to choose another path.
Narcis Termez, 68, who was attending a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's future of independence.
"Last year was the best time of our lives.
I saw my religious parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we are in a state of shock", he said.
Despite a small but important victory in the local elections last December, pro-independence parties in Catalonia are struggling to maintain their momentum this year, as some of the best leaders have either fled the country themselves or are in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Pugh, 42, a mechanic who was recording the protest in support of the police, told a mechanic on his phone that leaders from both parties were stirring up a dispute.
"Things are getting worse", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the degradation of democratic values and the repression we are seeing from the Spanish government", he said.
Laundry: People arrested for crashing a car into a house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at around 19:30 BST on Thursday at the Ballynagar Crescent.
Detective Inspector Blemings said the gates and building were damaged.
There's a chance the crossbow in the car was shot.
Menga's goal in the 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston led the team to victory.
Livingston shocked Rangers by handing Steven Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Holt's team won promotion and Hibernian finished second, with Dolly Menga's goal becoming a different one.
Gerard's side are without a single Premier League win this season and will face top-flight side Hart Sin on Sunday, who have an eight-point lead.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, their undefeated run in the division extends to six games, with new coach Holt, who replaced former coach Kenny Miller last month, undefeated.
Livingston missed the best opportunities the visitors had to offer.
Holt's team had to be far ahead before scoring, as their direct moves presented problems for the Rangers in every way.
Scott Robinbson cut the opposing team to penetrate the goal face, but Scott's effort was wasted on the goal face, and Alan Lithgow scored a goal face, but Craig Halkett returned a header.
Livingston, the hosts, who knew we could confuse the visitors with their midfield performance, were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that's how this important goal was born.
Rangers gave up on a free kick, and then Livingston attempted an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson delivering the ball to Menga, who scored from the middle of the box.
The Rangers had the ball most of the time at that point, but the home team's defense was unstoppable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unwavering in the net,
Despite the fact that the ball from Alfredo Morelos was held in place, Kelly continued this pattern into the second half.
Scott Pittman also tried to score, but the Rangers' goal failed, and Lit Guo was out of the open field in a Livingston style.
Crosses continued to come into Livingston's box, but all were wasted, and two penalty claims were rejected for allegedly showing a halket foul and handballing a substitute Glenn Middleton.
The 'phenomenon' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony MacArthur Arena
A legendary performance and the result of Livingston.
By continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory, they have excelled.
Since returning to their top position, Holt has rarely changed his style of play or teammates, but his ability to keep the team together since he took over is to be admired.
Holt had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett showed a remarkable ability to put the well-prepared defence in regular positions, while Menga kept Connor Goldsun and Joe Voral active throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the motivation to fail.
They played great under Gerard, and they're way below that level.
They didn't have the finishing capacity, and they only got to the home team's goal once, and this game is a warning to the Rangers because they are down in the points standings.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (Sept. 29), smiles and blue skies were in sight.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial German visit - intended to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
It is the largest city with a Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have been deployed for security reasons to prevent crowds of up to 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many people who support Erdogan have already arrived at the premises to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - raised their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to Germany.
The protests and celebrations reflected the divide between some German Turks who saw the visitor as a hero and others who denounced him as a dictator.
Motorcyclist killed in Deptford road accident
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, located southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and a paramedic examined the passenger, but he died at the scene.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in the same way on Childress Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the victim and inform his family.
The lane has been closed and buses have been diverted and drivers have been asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in clash inside prison
The prison office said six prison officers were injured in the attack at the high security men's prison.
Rioting broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and the rioting is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" personnel have been brought in to contain the situation, and the encounter involving eight prisoners is taking place inside a wing.
Officers with minor facial injuries have been treated at the scene of the encounter.
A prison service spokesperson said: "HMP has deployed specially trained prison staff to handle the ongoing developments at Long Latin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will never condone violence in our prisons and those responsible for violence will be handed over to the police, who may have to spend more time in jail".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, there were reports that the prison's governor had been treated after an inmate attacked him.
In October last year, prison staff were attacked by inmates with pool balls, and officers trained to control violence were deployed to the prison to handle the serious encounter.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with imminent flooding risk (may be beneficial for drought-prone areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression like this to hit Arizona, but this is exactly what's going to happen early next week as the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa moves southwest into the desert, creating flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will travel directly over Phoenix and is expected to arrive with rain on Monday afternoon.
"Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought down storms or low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that hit within 40 miles of the AZ boundary", the National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted.
The latest National Hurricane Center models are predicting 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated rainfall of up to 5 inches on Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive only 1 to 2 inches of rain, but may have isolated rainfall up to a full inch.
For areas that are not at risk of flash flooding, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the region is experiencing severe drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, with drought currently being felt in the Southwest, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least the second highest category of severe drought", Weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will first make landfall over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which has not lost its strength, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm will weaken as it interacts with the cooler waters of the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to make landfall on the coast of Mexico with the force of tropical winds on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall across parts of Mexico will pose a risk of flash flooding.
"From Baja California to northwestern Sonora, a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain will be received, with a 10 inch chance in some places", reports Weather.com.
It will then move northward across Mexico as a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, then move north through Arizona and into Teton Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its residual strength is extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rainfall is expected to cause life threatening flash floods, landslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Mid-Summer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following the discovery of a 16-year-old with stabbing notes in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured on the Excelsior terrace in the Midsomer Norton area at approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday.
The injured boy was admitted to the hospital, and the boy's health remains "stable".
Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area of Avon.
The officials requested that anyone with mobile phone footage of the incident hand it over to the police.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to endure "a little bit of the Democratic Party's contempt and hatred".
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to protest the ruthless and unjust policies of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to endure "a little bit of the Democratic Party's anger and hatred" throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying Christine Blase Ford's allegation that Kavanaugh sexually abused her when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified under oath during the trial that his allegations were true.
On Saturday, the president remarked that the American people saw Kavanaugh's "brightness, quality and courage" that day.
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for a judge with a decades-long history of public service and the most skilled legal scholar of our time", he remarked, speaking to supporters in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, the President indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination.
"We are only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not contesting, but I am actually contesting", he said.
"That's why I run everywhere, fighting for the big candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and deter".
A senior GOP leader's aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote on the Senate floor would be on or before Friday regarding Kavanaugh's nomination.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the death toll is rising.
At least 384 people were killed when large waves washed up on beaches following a massive earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
On Friday evening, as hundreds of people gathered for the festival in the city of Palu, waves of six meters (18 feet) high came crashing onto the shore, destroying everything in front of them, and hundreds died in the floodwaters.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"While the tsunami threat was high yesterday, people were on the beach and the victims were people who did not run away quickly following the warning", said Sutopo Parwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it flooded cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was traveling at 800 kilometers per hour (497 mph) across the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed to the top of trees to escape the tsunami and they were saved.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial footage released by the Disaster Management Agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and a mosque covered in water.
On Saturday, the tsunami's aftermath continued to hit the beaches.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 people living there.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located on a long and narrow coastline, may have increased the tsunami's intensity, the agency said.
The damage was "extensive", said Nugroho, with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels destroyed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were recovered from under the rubble of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
The coastal area, 300 km north of Palu and close to the epicentre, known as Dongala, is likely to have the highest death and damage, Ngroho said.
Communication systems were also disrupted, with "no information" from Dongola, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It is already a disaster, but it could be worse", the Red Cross said.
The agency was widely blamed on Saturday for not giving a tsunami warning in Palu, but officials explained that waves were hitting within the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage of a man frantically shouting tsunami warnings to people walking down the street from the top floor of a building is circulating on social media.
Within minutes of hitting the waterfront, it swallowed buildings, cars, and other items.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power to be cut off and communication systems across the bridge were down, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but survivors are without food and other basic amenities.
The airport in the city will remain closed until October and will be open for rescue operations only.
President Joko Widodo will visit the refugee camps in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
Things are bad.
World Vision staff members who escaped the tsunami and arrived in the city of Palu, said they were experiencing the destruction despite living in tarpaulin tents in the yard of their own office.
"They told me they saw many houses being destroyed", he said.
Things are very bad.
Although relief teams have begun to pour in for relief efforts, some complain that well-skilled foreign volunteers are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, a natural disaster can only be declared a national disaster if the government declares it to be a national disaster.
It has not yet been declared a national disaster.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government declares this a national disaster, we can prepare for international assistance, but that is not the case yet".
Now in its second night after Friday's tsunami, Palu is hoping that friends and relatives will come back after the hopeless stories of natural disasters and the loss of lives.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from a cave.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman from the rubble, lying next to her mother's body.
For the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month, two of the paragliders trained by Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, have gone missing in the tsunami.
The others trapped at the Rowa Rowa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional stress", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that within hours of the news of the Rowa Rowa Hotel collapse, the news spread among the paragliding community and he constantly sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival.
All messages received a single grey check mark instead of a pair of blue check marks.
"I think it means that the messages have not been passed", he said.
$26,750 was stolen while filling an ATM in Newport, Levi.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday in Newport, Levi, robbers stole $26,750 while Brink Officer was filling an ATM.
Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release that the driver of the car was trying to empty and refill an ATM at the entertainment complex.
While he was working, another "broke out from behind the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money he was bringing for delivery.
The press release says that eyewitnesses saw multiple suspects flee the scene of the crime, but the police did not specify how many people were involved.
Anyone with information about the perpetrators should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changed his name to Kanye West.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to "Y".
On Saturday, he tweeted about his name change: "The person officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was known as 'Ye' for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change is expected to be revealed on a live broadcast on Saturday night, when he is expected to release his new album 'Yandi'.
West is said to be replacing Ariana Grande, who left the show for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the new name is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe the most commonly used word in the Bible is 'ye,' 'ye' means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So, I am you, I am us, all of us.
I went from "one" to "you" -- that is, we are a reflection of who we are, good or bad or confused.
This album is a reflection of who we are".
West is one of the most famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs, who was known by various names like Puff Daddy, P Daddy or Daddy, said that his favorite names this year were Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who had previously worked with West, changed his name to avoid hyphens and capitalization.
The president-elect of Mexico has said that the military will not be used against civilians.
As the country arrives at the 50th anniversary of the bloody reprisal against the students, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said military force would never be used against civilians.
Lopez Obrador said in the Plaza Atlético that "the army will never be used to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the Plaza was the scene of a peaceful demonstration, which was met with heavy military action. Some 300 people were killed.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support the younger generation of Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving the youth into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in AI, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, wants the US to double its spending on research in the field.
Kai-Fu Lee made the comments after various departments of the US government made AI announcements, even though the US does not have an official AI policy as a whole.
China last year launched a plan to become the world's top innovator by 2030.
"Considering the fact that all other countries are far behind the US, doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, and we are very much looking forward to what the next step in AI will be", Lee said.
Doubling funding means the next big AI breakthrough will likely be in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who has written a book published by Huffington Mifflin Harcourt titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", is currently the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, and Lee has invested in Face++, China's most important AI company.
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University, he built an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American player Othello, and later he worked as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee praised the impact of US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next generation of philosophers would be ready to meet.
Lee said researchers in the US often struggle to get government funding.
"China does not take the best academics, but corporate companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could help support US AI efforts.
"I think that people who do PhDs in AI should naturally have a green card", Lee said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its 'Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan'.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China is funding people in academies, just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund US researchers, but the level of activity in academia in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, an initiative aimed at engaging stakeholders from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DAPRA announced that it will invest $2 billion in its AI Next initiative.
As for NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been taken for months on the US law that called for the creation of a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move intended to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's application to join the European Union or NATO.
Because of the province of Macedonia within Greece, Greece has taken the position that the name of its northern neighbor, Macedonia, represents a claim on its territory, and has therefore blocked Macedonia's applications to join NATO or the European Union using its veto power.
The two countries reached a compromise in June over the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition argues that the name change would weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that this minimum requirement might not be met, as at least 50 percent of the population must vote for the referendum to be valid.
The ballot in the referendum read: "Do you agree to membership in NATO and the European Union under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
The group, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Sajev, argues that the name change is the price Macedonia must pay to seek access to bodies such as the European Union and NATO; Macedonia is one of two countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the younger generation of Macedonia, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, which means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old from Skopje.
While not legally in existence, sufficient members of Parliament said that they would abide by the referendum results regardless.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of any irregularities as of 1 pm.
However, in the 2016 parliamentary election, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots, the voting rate at one o'clock was 36%, compared to just 16% in the referendum.
"I came to vote for my children, Europe is our place", said 62-year-old voter Jose Tanevsky in the capital Skopje prison.
In Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Sajev, his wife Zorica and son Dushku voted in a referendum on the country's name change, which paved the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, in front of the tents set up by the people who boycotted the referendum, 54-year-old Vladimir Kvardakov would set up a small stage and pull up chairs.
"We are not opposed to joining NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the back door", Kvardakov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can ask China or Russia for help and be part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Sajeev said that Macedonia, which currently has an unemployment rate of over 20%, would need investment to gain NATO membership.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour of the name change, because 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU membership and NATO membership", Saev said after the vote.
He said the "Wanna" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a poll conducted on Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters should participate in the referendum - less than the required percentage.
According to a poll conducted on Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters should participate in the referendum - less than the required percentage.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, we need 50% of the vote and one vote.
The defeat of the referendum would be a serious blow to the policies of the Western-oriented government that took office last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguera of Manchester City, breaks through the entire British defence
The 2-0 win over Manchester City in the final on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, tied the British defence with Sergio Aguera and Raheem Sterling.
Aguera scored in the 65th minute, as easily as it sounds.
At the start of this attempt, the Argentine striker was getting a pass in the middle of the field.
Before the ball hit the open field, Aguera leaped through the three British defenders.
And then you see Aguera covered in four green jerseys.
Aguera pushed a defender and cheated several defenders by the side of the England goal face.
Agüera passed the ball when he saw Sterling on the left.
The English forward, who was the first to get the ball, returned it to Aguera and then Aguera's shot tricked England goalkeeper Matthew Ryan into shaking the right side of the net.
"Aguera has a retail problem on her feet", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We told him about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky because he scored at that time".
But in the Premier League battle, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their initial lead.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that match, Aguera got the ball at the British border.
LeRoy Zane, who was on the left, passed the Aguera with a beautiful throw.
Zane hit the ball for a while, then passed it to Sterling, who was coming up.
The Sky Blues forward hit the net before the ball reached the boundary.
City will face Hohenheim at the Rheine-Necker-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany on Tuesday afternoon at 12:55 pm in the Champions League group stage.
Scherzer wants to play Spoiler versus the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's no reason to start again.
But Scherzer, who has always wanted to compete, wants to get on the field against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff mentality, and the Rockies have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but they're still fighting for their first division title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can rub our fingers knowing the atmosphere in crowded Denver, and the other team will be playing at a higher level of whatever point I face this year.
Why can't I compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but Scherzer, who has expressed interest in such a situation, is likely to be allowed to do so.
Scherzer, who is set to take his 34th start, threw a bullpin on Thursday, and he will be in his natural rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander Scherzer is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts over 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's visit to West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the nomination of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
"The outcome of everything we have done so far will depend on November.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
This is the biggest one -- I'm not running, but I'm actually running, which is why I'm running everywhere, fighting for the big candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see the terrible, terrible terrorist behavior of the Democrats, and you see what's happening right now.
They are determined to get back in power by any means necessary, which is to say, by the most petty and vile means you can see.
They don't care who they hurt to get power and control, they don't care who they trample on, they want power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and deter".
Asked "What have you seen over the last four days", Trump criticized Democrats as "full of hate and filth and pettiness and dishonesty".
When the Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein was mentioned by Trump, the audience cheered.
"Do you remember what they said?
Did you pee on the document?
Oh, what the hell.
No, oh, no, I'll wait for it -- that's really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a large party.
And it will not forgive those who speak openly.
I was not surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to warn me.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome - and that's because I've been very open.
My parliamentary colleague, Juan Rián, who has been a staunch anti-Semite, had the same experience.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn on the Taker resolution.
Ironically, Jeremy has disagreed with previous leaders on similar issues, such as responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe.
The announcement for Saturday's Nottingham East Labour Meeting stated, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For almost all of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings have been like this.
Sadly, this is not the nature of many meetings today, and the promise of "more kind, more gentle" politics has long been forgotten; indeed, if such a promise ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not forgivable in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on its acceptability to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and my colleagues, who I had previously thought shared my political views, expected me to go in the opposite direction, to take positions on national security and the single market, the European Union, that I would never agree with.
Whenever I address a public, regardless of the subject, there is a lot of hype on social media, some people say I should be dismissed as an MP, I should quit central politics and I should not be in the Labour Party.
This isn't just my experience.
I am certainly luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments I get are about political issues.
I have a deep respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual and racial harassment every day but never shy away from it.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is that it makes the levels of hype natural.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn suggested that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Actually, we are not a broad assembly now, and every time a "no confidence" motion comes, or a change in the electoral rules, the party is shrinking.
And then over the next two years, I get a lot of advice, and the advice is, I should keep my head down, I should not talk so much, so I can be "accurate".
But that's not why I came into politics.
I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, and I was so outraged by the Thatcher government's failure to actually cover my entire school classroom, that I always tried to provide better public services to those in need, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics under any circumstances, including the last election.
No one at Nottingham East will be confused about my policy views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
I can only say to those who are promoting Friday's resolution that as the country moves towards Brexit, which will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But what I really want to say is not to Nottingham Moment, but to the Labour Party supporters and non-supporters in my constituency: I am proud to serve you, and I assure you that no threat of dismissal or political move will deter me from engaging in what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East.
Air 38-17 Melrose: undefeated to air lead.
While the previous two draws may have almost skewed the final result, it is certain that Ayr deserved to win today's surprisingly exciting Tenants Premiership match.
These two teams are the top of the table with 10 undefeated seasons.
In short, it was their excellent defense and their courage to test their potential that drove the team forward, and coach Peter Murczy has every right to rejoice.
"Our ability has been tested in all the matches so far and they have not lost yet, so I am happy", he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie commented: "The fame is due to AIR, who have been at the forefront of testing the possibilities".
Grant Anderson's fourteenth-minute effort to get to the goal by Frazier Climo put Ayr in the lead, but the Warriors, who gave Melrose a chance, gave a yellow card to Scotland's all-time capped Rory Hughes for the match, although Jason Baggott's effort did not pay off.
A penalty put Airin in the lead with Climo, who had scored a solo try almost halfway through the game, giving Airin a 17-5 lead at halftime.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and when Patrick Anderson's effort to get Baggott on goal reduced the gap to five points.
Ruyarid Not suffered a serious injury that caused a long break in play, but when the match resumed, Ayr regained his momentum, with a try from Stafford McDowell, and Climo scoring.
Then the interim captain of the Iron was given a yellow card, and the opportunity Melrose had to take on the magic ring of acute stress prevented Bruce Colvin from reaching the goal.
Although the home side started to bounce back, in the penalty line-out, when Hutchinson received a yellow card for pushing Climo without the ball, MacPherson made an effort to jump to the advancing iron.
Klimo scored again as he had done when the match resumed, before taking Rowe on a box kick from David Armstrong and sending home-side edge-of-field Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt.
Still Game Star is looking for opportunities in the restaurant industry.
The news came to light when Ford Kirwan took over as director of a restaurant company that was licensed to the still game star Ford Kirran, who was preparing to enter the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old star, who plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, co-wrote the script with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemp.
The duo have announced that the ninth series will be coming soon, and it will be the show's final series, with Keiran seemingly busy planning her life after Craig Lang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adrift Moon Ltd.
The star declined to comment on the news, but a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kearnan was planning to focus on Glasgow's "thriving restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are on patrol at Rigging-Claude Naval Headquarters in Lhasa.
A navy blue flag is flown over government buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the same slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to recover it".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of having to cede their coastline to Chile in a bloody resource dispute in the 19th century is still fresh - a desire to once again sail across the Pacific.
This hope has been there for decades, but it is now reaching its peak as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia now has a sense of dynamism, unity and calm, and the country is certainly looking forward to the outcome with optimism", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will look sympathetically on Bolivia's claim that after decades of unstable negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia a path to the sea with full authority.
Bolivia's influential local president Evo Morales - who will face a contentious battle for re-election next year - has high hopes for Monday's verdict.
"We are on the verge of returning to the Pacific Ocean", he swore last August.
Some analysts believe that the court's ruling in favor of Bolivia is unlikely to happen because even if the court does, nothing will happen.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no jurisdiction to rule on a matter within Chilean territory and is not mandated to determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Instead of pushing Bolivia's goal forward, the developments of the past four years may have set back that goal.
"The current problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric may have also leaked leftovers from Chile's positive view of Bolivia, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at times, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velázquez, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
He said Monday's verdict was a wonderful opportunity for Bolivia to "open a new era of relations with Chile" and "end 139 years of differences" for mutual benefit.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue for his political gain.
"Bolivia must never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This verdict is an opportunity to get what we need to get over the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until the United States can be trusted.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that the country would not disarm those who could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri was addressing the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to be prepared to honour the commitments made during the Summit of Enemies in Singapore.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began trying to restart nuclear diplomacy talks, which had stalled three months after his summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said the continued escalation and US obstruction of the declaration of an end to the Korean War would only be a "pipe dream" if North Korea ever got to its knees.
The US has been reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang initially making significant disarmament moves.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second summit.
There is widespread uncertainty as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning a weapons factory, as it is likely to be seen as the only way to ensure the security of the nation.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The latest line of the imminent huge hat collection has been displayed in Parish Fashion on the High Street next door.
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or cover the entire canvas, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have launched a line of crazy oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway.
Hats that look completely impractical have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have taken their eye-catching creations to the ramp.
Valentino's masterpiece was an over-the-top light brown hat with wide edges like a feather that stood on the models' heads like a swamp.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled turmeric, a magician's hat and a pineapple - but these hats weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also illuminated a collection of strange faces, many of which were suitable for use in the Halo.
These eye-catchingly colored masks sewn into the lips of many, more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than of horticulture.
One creature resembled a full-size scuba diving gear with snorkel and goggles, while the other was like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're still in the big fashion frenzy, you're in luck.
According to fashionistas, these large-sized hats will soon be available in shops near you.
These oversized hats come in the style of La Bomba, a two-foot wide, wire-frame hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wore.
The cult label behind the impractical hats that went viral on social media led to another great creation, a straw beach bag as big as a swimsuit, that models walked around on the ramp wearing.
It was a separate creation from the La Riviera SS19 collection of Parisian Fashion Week, with a white leather handle on top, and a banded orange raffia bag with raffia curls cut into it.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FemmeLine: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the High Street next summer - because the designer has made such an impact that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.'
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, with another set of exceptional test scores, continued in 2018, showing individual and sympathetic success in sport, music and other community endeavours, reinforcing academic excellence.
Represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and attended by over 30,000 students across Scotland, they strive to provide the highest quality of service to students and parents.
The aim of the Free Schools is to prepare students for their future higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector where a fantastic school curriculum can be designed and implemented, we see that modern languages will continue to be a popular and preferred subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language that is in their mind, it will go into their head.
But if you speak to him in his native language, it will go to his heart".
It is a powerful reminder that when she wants to connect with people from other countries and gain their trust, she cannot rely on English alone.
From the recent test results this year, we can see that languages are rising in the league tables with the highest pass rates among independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who studied foreign languages achieved higher A grade.
Data collected from the 74 member schools of the SCIES show that 72% of students achieved a Higher A grade in Mandarin, 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish achieved A grades.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as key skills that children and students will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as an elective subject, as are STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) in free school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers cited a lack of language skills as 17 per cent of the reasons for challenging candidates in hiring positions.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare students for future employment opportunities.
These skills are indispensable in a globalized world, as languages are required in the future jobs.
Whatever career path they choose, if candidates have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because they will have long-term skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will naturally put a person who knows multiple languages far ahead of the competition.
In 2013, a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to start a conversation, and that double the 15 percent said that the only foreign language they knew was French.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for kids today.
Knowing multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school teaches a different language.
While a handful of schools focus on more classical modern languages, such as Mandarin or Japanese, other schools will teach languages that are considered to be important for the UK as we look to 2020.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a handful of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field of foreign languages.
Although we don't know what the future holds, Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children to succeed in life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed.
It is now undeniable that in a global business environment, languages will continue to be an indispensable key element for the future of the country and this must be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for children in Scotland.
I'm not going to be in the fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will be playing for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James on the field for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers is over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet decided how many minutes James will play.
"The time will be more than a minute and less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will only be playing for a limited time.
After the first practice this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this point in my career to prepare", he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaign rallies.
This is the first of five rallies planned for Trump next week in places with large numbers of followers, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to securing the vote for his Supreme Court nominee, Trump also aims to build public support ahead of the November midterm elections, as there are widespread concerns that the Republican Party will lose control of Congress when the November elections are held.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7pm (Eastern Time).
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube below.
Trump may also be referring to this week's trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose case has been marred by a growing sexual misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh, which the Senate confirmation vote was postponed by a week due to an ongoing FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of these conference papers is to give the Republican Party a little boost as it faces the November election.
So, according to Reuters, supporters of President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week were aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as the party seeks to maintain and increase the Republican majority in the House of Representatives".
"Congressional control is critical to the president's agenda, so as we heat up the campaign, he will visit states as much as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, but declined to be named.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally at the Wesleyan Co. Arena in Wheeling, Ohio, will draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get the attention of the Pittsburgh media.
Trump visited West Virginia last month, and it will be his second visit with Saturday's rally, a state he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in the 2016 election.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is far behind in the polls.
The fact that the president has to come to the polls to give Morrissey a head start is not a good sign for him, Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting courage to keep up expectations as they enter Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may be just what this year's Ryder Cup needs.
Although the fluctuating gameplay is entirely a made-up command, it is something that players actually believe in, especially in games like this.
So where is the advantage now?
"They were six points ahead, now they are four, so I guess that's a little leap for us", Jordan Speith said as he left after the game.
Europe, with a four-point lead in the 12-match series, is certainly ahead.
However, as Speith says, Americans feel the wind is a little in their favor and there is plenty to be brave about. They are encouraged by the excellence of Speeth and Justin Thomas's play. They are proud that they both played together all day and scored three points out of four.
In From Tea to Green, the deadly player Speeth stands at the forefront as an example to others.
With Speight and Thomas two points behind after two games, the cheers were amplified when Speight made a crucial "putt" to bring the match to four all-squares.
His dog, who won the match in the 15th, received the same cheers, and it was on the floor telling people that he believed the American team was not out of the game.
"You really have to know your game deeply and care about it", Speeth said.
That's all any player has left.
18 holes to prove his excellence.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to have scored more points than Speed and Thomas in the last two days, undeniable Ryder Cup records.
The twins are not wrong with the European's four-in-four, but the two-in-four.
The only pair not to take a bogey shot on Saturday afternoon was the Hollywood 10 but they did not take bogey shots on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and then on Friday morning when they played the final nine holes.
They are the players to beat on Sunday, which underlines the game and the way their energy seems to flow from the noisy crowd to you. There are no players more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to ensure a European win as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
It's better if you both play different holes at the same time.
However, talk of European glory remains a matter of timelessness.
Sergio Garcia, the hero of this morning's Foreballs, was easily handled by Buba Watson and Webb Simpson when he paired with Alex Noran.
In the first nine holes, a bogey and two doubles pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit that was unmanageable.
But on Sunday, no one will lift you out of the pit.
The interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other and the advice they don't give, and the way any strategy can change in an instant, is what makes forebol and foreball so fascinating to watch.
Europe, which has played well as a team so far, is going into the final day with a good lead, but this fourth session has also shown that Team USA, which some, especially their country, have doubted, has a fighting spirit.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe, which emerged from Saturday's four-balls and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States, heads into the final day of the Ryder Cup with a healthy lead.
Inspired pairs Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way to their four-point lead at Le Golf National with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods.
Thomas Jorn's European side, looking to win back the trophy they lost two years ago at Hasseltine, dominated the American side, who were on the verge of a 3-1 lead in the morning fours.
The United States was more resistant in the Fourth, winning two games, but it could not make up the shortfall.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to retain the title.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row. Meanwhile, he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after an exciting weekend, are the only other pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points from their first four matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reid in the fours, they then joined forces to beat a disconcerted Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCamp, with a more aggressive 5&4.
Woods, who was pulled out of two matches on Saturday, has shown explosions of excellence but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in the forwards and forwards, including seven in a row.
After resting for the morning foreball, Justin Rose joined Henrik Stenson in the foursome to return to beat world ranked number one and three Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koppke by 2&1.
However, on that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris, Europe could not make everything their own.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the foursomes they won a tough 2&1 over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McElroy in the foursomes, losing the opening two holes, to 4&3.
Although Fury's side needed a draw to keep the trophy in hand, only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into singles.
They've been in second place for two days, but I think they'll be outnumbered on Sunday.
North Korea has said that there is "no way" of unilateral disarmament because of lack of confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
North Korea has taken "significant steps for reputation" since last year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing a nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology, Ri Yong told the annual UN General Assembly.
However, we are not seeing a similar response from the US, he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we have no way of disarming ourselves unilaterally in the first place".
Although Ri reiterated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, his statement is significant because he did not deny that unilateral nuclear disarmament is not in the cards, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri mentioned that at the summit in Singapore on 12 June, Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued a joint statement in which Kim pledged to work for the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
The US has insisted that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons, despite North Korea's efforts to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War.
Washington also rejected calls for a relaxation of the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is forcing 'nuclear disarmament first' and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, even resisting the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The idea that we will be brought to our knees by sanctions is a pipe dream for people who don't know about us.
The problem is that our mistrust is growing due to the continuous sanctions".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had said at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, referring to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, the Minister added: "The party to this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the US, and the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a head.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from that of Ri's speech at the UN last year. Ri told the UN that Trump's call on Kim as "Mr. Satan President" was a suicide attempt and that North Korean rockets targeting the US mainland were therefore necessary.
Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said there was still more to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea achieved nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline, adding, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, five months".
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions so far.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the sanctions proposed by the Security Council must continue vigorously until complete, final and verifiable nuclear disarmament is achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously lifted sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Pompeo on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
North Korea denounced him for making "crowd-sourcing demands" after he left Pyongyang, although he left saying progress had been made.
North Korea had promised at a meeting with Moon earlier this month that it would demolish a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took similar measures.
He said Kim told him that the security guarantees he had been given in Singapore and the move towards normalization of relations with Washington were the same measures he had been asked to take.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough sleep.
This year, a new course was introduced to get all students at Harvard University more sleep, as a fight against the growing macho culture of caffeinated, all-nighter study.
One academic found that students at the world's top university often lacked clarity on the basics of how to care for themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Sizler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a lecture on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'I'm a senior, why are you telling me this now?'
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
First introduced this year, the course provides students with the basics of how good sleep habits are academic, how they help with late performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of University Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was discovered that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the door room, where students can hear about the effects of caffeine and light, how it affects late performance due to insufficient sleep, and the importance of sleep routines as they click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books.
Another section explains to students how chronic sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages students to reflect on their daily routines.
'We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke,' added Professor Sisler.
He said that a culture of pride in saying 'I learned without sleeping' still exists and that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring that they get enough good quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - when we don't sleep to avoid weight gain, we are pushing the brain into starvation mode, which causes persistent hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Sisler design the course, which Raymond attended during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that this course has been an eye opener for him and inspired the entire campus to take this course.
He hopes that as a next step, all postgraduate students will be required to complete a similar curriculum before joining a competitive-based institution.
Professor Sisler recommended that students consider setting alarms to inform them of bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can conventionally obscure your circadian rhythm and then cause problems sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeated Gerard's players
When Dolly Menga's footsteps led Steven Gerrard's disintegrating team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston, Rangers once again felt the pain of being far from their regular place.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first competitive win away from home since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side suffered just their second defeat in 18 games as Gerrard's manager, leaving them eight points behind the uncontrollable defending premiership champions Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, but the Rangers' under-motivated lineup didn't look like they were going to hit back.
Rangers now down to sixth, Livingston climbed to third, only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
The fact that Lanceman Kal and Spencer were hit in the head by what appeared to be a rear-end collision may have made it harder for the Rangers to take care of him.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that reached the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was the same Levi's 11 that took a point from Hearts last week, and he must have been so pleased with the well-trained squad that he breathed down the opponents at every turn.
Although the Rangers may have dominated the position, Livingston handled the ball well.
Menga's first leaf pass in the second minute of the game sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goalpost, where they should have scored, but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity.
Although a highly skilled freak of Kagan Jacobs approached Captain Craig Halkett, his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able to make only one shot that advanced to the back post.
The Rangers were in control, but their front line showed more hope than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have got a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided in the 15th minute, but referee Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers' two shots in the first half were scored, but a header by Lasana Collibali and a half-hearted shot by Ovi Izaria did not bother former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Levy's 34th-minute goal may have been against the game, but if their consensus is to be taken at face value, no one can deny that they deserved it.
The Rangers again failed to manage a skillful set piece from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher delivered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and chose Mangan to finish the simple.
Gerard responded by dropping Ryan Kent to replace Collibaly at half-time. The change made an almost instant impact. He made a move with Morlowe on the wing, but a heartbreaking Kelly rushed from his line to stop it.
But Livingston was keeping the visitors in exactly the kind of game they enjoyed.
Holt's side could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor denied opportunities to Jacobs and Lithgow.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton argued for another late penalty when he was paired with Jacobs, but again Thompson denied it.
The inventor of the Geiger counter.
Now a page from our "Sun Day Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has since become a staple of science and a staple of pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboy scientists:
He said: What is this plot?
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you turn on these earphones, you can hear the effects of atoms that are producing radioactivity in minerals".
"Tell me, it's definitely going to explode now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention still lives today, bearing his name.
A new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to "find" the motherfucking cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill the motherfucking cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the killer cells as part of the treatment.
The technique involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a lab.
Then, they can "see" a common protein that is responsible for many cancers, and then inject these cells back into the patient.
A trial vaccine in patients with various cancers is showing promising results.
When a woman was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize rogue cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared after more than 18 months.
This method involves isolating immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein, known as HER2, that is responsible for many cancers, and then injecting these cells back into the patient.
"The results we have suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor Jay Berzowski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Prof. Berzowski explained that HER2 influences the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer.
A similar approach, which extracts immune cells from patients and teaches them how to target cancer cells, has been successful in treating leukemia.
After appearing on SNL, Kanye West has been outed by pro-Trump tabloids in a giant hat.
But it's not so much Asia.
After a disjointed performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run in 2020, people called Kanye West a coward during a live show on Saturday night.
Wearing the Make America Great hat, after singing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, he lashed out at the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, 'How do you like a racist Trump?'"
"If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
The SNL show opened with a skit starring Matt Damon mocking the oath of office of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in connection with sexual assault rights issues raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, footage of West's speechlessness was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the Rock was trying to mock West by posting this.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he felt very difficult to wear the hat on the stage.
"They scared me on the floor.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat".
They threatened me!
They say I'm in a sinking place", West said, reports The Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sinking place? Wear my Superman cap because it means you can't tell me what to do", he said.
Try love".
Variety reported that audiences were shocked at least twice by his comments, with one SNL cast member telling the publication: "The whole studio fell into a death silence".
West is introduced as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend rapper Mac Miller had recently died.
West dressed up like Perry Bottle and sang "I Love It", which surprised many.
West received support from Candace Turner, head of conservative group TP USA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing out from the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was the same as he was, which was absolutely amazing.
"But I will not choose to pay a reward (buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') to someone I believe is nurturing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we", they added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, tweeting that he was "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, but West is following in the footsteps of Diddie, who was known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, P. Diddy.
West's fellow rapper Snoop Dogg changed his name to Snoop Lion, while music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, he was previously known as Prince.
He was charged with murder in connection with a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhakamore.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is invading a toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as the title character, Jon Snow, in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old star has also attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that seeing such roles on screen leads young boys to believe that roughness is necessary to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie (31), admitted that he 'firmly' believes the issue needs to be addressed.
'I personally feel very strongly now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he asked.
'In view of the problems we see today, what are we teaching our boys growing up?'
With so many characters in TV shows that permeate masculinity, Kit believes television is partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He continued: 'What is instinctive, what is taught?
What is it that is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they need certain traits to be men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
Because something is wrong with the young people.'
He admitted in an interview that he would not be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ended next summer, and that he was "tired of the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a filmmaker and his brother who is a bandit.
The star recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so the show gave me a future family and a life to move forward", he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Yeagrette, the lover of Jon Snow, the character of Kit.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
Almost 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, marking a change from the past.
HIV has traditionally spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of blood from infected individuals.
However, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan Province that the number of HIV cases had been almost eliminated.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS cases in China is increasing by a million a year.
HIV transmission through sexual contact among LGBT communities in China is a serious problem.
China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people remains severe.
Studies suggest that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the country's persistent conservative values.
Men who have intercourse with each other often spread the disease because they do not receive adequate sexual protection.
As part of the effort to address this problem, since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV medicines universally available.
Maxina Waters said her staff had not leaked the data of the Republican senators and that such allegations were "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees posted personal information of Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that these are just claims made by "far-right" pundits and websites.
Lies, lies, more vile lies, Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unidentified person from Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing regarding sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came online shortly after all three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedStat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Water Services office, and Hill reported that the information of a member of the Water Services staff was leaked.
"This baseless allegation is completely false, utterly false", Waters continued.
As a result of these false and misleading allegations, the identity, personal information and security of one of my employees has been compromised, but my employee is not responsible in any way for the leakage of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false, completely false.
Waters' statement was made online, prompting criticism from people including former White House press secretary Ari Flescher.
"There is anger in this denial", Flescher wrote.
This suggests that they do not have the passion to be a Congressman.
When someone accuses you of something you didn't do, you shouldn't get angry.
We must not be stubborn.
Do not question the motives of the accuser.
We must show calmness and transparency.
Flescher was trying to compare Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics had accused of appearing very angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's a big deal if it's true", he tweeted.
The office has notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement of these false claims, Waters said in a statement.
We will ensure that the culprits are brought to light and that they are held legally accountable for any and all acts of destruction or injury to my employees or any of my employees", she continued.
Johnny English Strike Again - The powerless spy spoof by Rowan Atkinson
It is now common for any new film with a British slant to seek Brexit relevance, and it seems to be the case with this second installment of the 'Johnny English' action-comedy spoof franchise - which began with 'Johnny English' in 2003 and was revived with 'Johnny English Ribbon' in 2011.
Will this reverse self-deprecating irony about how stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the blinkered, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has a second license to fatten things up - his signaling name is more than just a comic creation designed for non-English speaking, movie-going regions.
He is certainly a dull secret agent, and although he has everything from bizarre disguises to a glamorous appeal, a powder of Mr. Bean's phantasmagoria and a handful of phantasmagories of the young man who contributes a single note to the theme tune 'Chariot of Fire' at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics made him look like Inspector Clausov.
He was actually based on the traveler and man of mystery that Atkinson himself once played in the now-lost Barclays TV commercials.
There's a good moment or two in this latest Johnny English release.
I loved Johnny English approaching the helicopter, wearing a medieval armor and with the rotating blades sounding firmly on his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's ability to physically make fun of himself is evident in the film, but the humor is lacking in power and oddly overused, especially in an era when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently add comedy as an ingredient.
The humor in the film feels more shaped for children than for adults, and I never felt Johnny English's crazy adventures were more fresh or focused than the silent film entertainments starring Atkinson as Mr. Bean.
The film is also a perennial theme of Great Britain in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain's super-secret web network and reveals the identities of all the British agents working in the field of secret intelligence, which in turn frustrates the agent on duty - unfortunately, Kevin Eldon, who plays the agent, has only a small role.
This is the final nail in the coffin for an already politically broken PM who is proud and hates everything. Although Emma Thompson does a great job of playing this Theresa May-like character, the truth is that there is nothing more in the script for her to do.
The Prime Minister's intelligence advisers are telling them that since the identity of all active spies in the intelligence sector has been released, they need to bring in someone who is retired.
The target is a disorganized Johnny English, who is looking for a job as a schoolmaster in some wealthy institution, but is teaching off-the-record lessons on how to perform 'undercover' operations: There are some good jokes here, and it's good that Johnny English is teaching the School of Rock-Type Academy to spy.
English is brought back to the White Hall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his longtime classmate Bogue, whom Ben Miller once again played.
Bug is now married, his wife is a submarine commander, and Vicky Pepperdine is ruined in this 'joly-hockey-stick' story.
Batman and Robin return to Her Majesty's Secret Service and begin work, but things go awry when they have to face the beautiful beauty played by Olga Kuryolenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously into the web of an influential tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: Jake Lacy plays the cunning billionaire Jason Volta.
English and Buff begin a procession of fake copies: they dress as waiters and set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle themselves abroad in Volta's luxury van and make a fuss; John English throws things into total disarray when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get inside Volta's house.
They certainly brought out all the talent for this part of the film, but it's so gentle and cheerful, it's like watching a little TV on the whole.
It's a mediocre film.
I still can't help but think about what I felt when I saw other Johnny English films: Couldn't the British film industry provide a character that matched the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
The Labour Party has denied reports that it is planning a plan to make the British work four days a week but get paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a progressive plan to allow Britons to work four days a week but earn five days' wages.
The party reportedly wants company capitalists to pass on profits made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
If this happens, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will be able to buy back their old pay.
The idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and the party plans to tilt the country in favour of workers, news sources say.
As a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy, the Trade Union Congress has adopted the idea of a four-day work week.
A senior Labour Party leader told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ideal aspiration for the Party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and as part of the Party's overall industrial policy".
The Labour Party was not the first party to adopt a four-day week, the Green Party had promised a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this ambition is currently not accepted by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The idea of a four-day week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explain his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' of utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in white companies may not get their full shares back, as a Labour government could be able to charge 'reductions' based on perceived wrongdoing.
He confirmed that there are plans to include workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10 per cent stake of private sector enterprises to employees.
Lindsey C. Graham and John Kennedy were interviewed by 60 Minutes to see if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh would change their mind.
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, has raised questions about whether the bureau's findings will prompt any Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes C" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI's findings would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"My answer is, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to the trial, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, after the allegation came out, I called him and said, 'Did you do this?'
He showed determination, determination and unwavering".
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be set in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, it's just an accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett heroically denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Balsey Ford.
No one who has been named has been able to confirm this.
This is a 36-year-old story.
I don't see any new change".
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be hosted by New York this Saturday, with an annual concert featuring impressive performances by celebrities, as well as a remarkable mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to attend the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the program's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Prosperity Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
To get a free ticket to attend the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a number of tasks or "actions"; these activities include volunteering, emailing or calling a world leader, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But with only 12 years left to achieve the goal, how successful is Global Citizen?
Is rewarding people with a free concert ticket a radical way to get people to respond positively to a call to action, or is it another form of selflessness called "clictivism" - the state of people who think they are making a real difference by signing an online complaint or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters in support of a platform of different causes.
It says these actions have helped to motivate world leaders to announce guarantees and policies worth more than $37 billion, aimed at moving the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has selected 390 pledges and declarations arising from its activities, and has distributed or raised at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the money they raised has so far directly impacted 649 million people worldwide.
One of the key assurances is that following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens, they have been offered $35 million to help the country end malnutrition in Rwanda. The pledge was made by The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based part-nursing firm of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to reach their full potential".
With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put a complete stop to the social injustice of malnutrition in history", Tracy Ullman, Power of Nutrition Ambassador, told the crowd at a live music event in London in April 2018.
After taking over 5,000 steps urging the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the Government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition scheme, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is "Why do you think extreme poverty can be ended?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement before us, we will win, because we are stronger when we are together.
This year, the event in New York will feature artists Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Moni, and is hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Huff Jackman.
US Navy could be used as "barrier" to disrupt Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinkay has revealed that Washington could seek the Navy's help "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets including the Middle East, reports The Washington Examiner.
Zinké accused Russia of intervening in Syria as a way to seek new markets, and it should be noted that Russia is intervening there at the invitation of the legitimate government of Syria.
I believe they are intervening in the Middle East because they want to be a source of energy in the Middle East, just as they are doing in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
According to this official, there are ways and means to resolve this.
He said that the United States has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes are open and remain open, and to block their energy if necessary, to ensure that it does not reach the market.
Sinke was addressing the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit working group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that in practice they are one and the same.
Describing Russia as a "one-size-fits-all" economy based on fossil fuels, he said that "the economic pathway for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make the most of the fuels and use one instead of the other".
The Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, excluding Russia, which would be a very cost-effective option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is holding Germany "hostage" to Berlin and Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be seen as a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The US stance was met with a blow from Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the plan.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading trade association, has called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big headache for me when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will make a "firm decision" about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would make a "firm decision" about running for president following the midterm elections.
She confirmed to Warren that she would consider running at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and it's time for a woman to be at the top of government", she said, reports The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, she said.
Warren was openly critical of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"We need an FBI investigation before we can record the vote", Warren tweeted on Friday.
However, according to a poll released on Thursday, a majority of people in Warren's own constituency are considering whether Warren should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a contest.
Former Governor Deval Patrick received the most support in the opinion poll for running, with 38 percent supporting his candidacy while 48 percent opposed.
Other top Democratic leaders discussed as potential candidates for the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a formal decision on whether to run in January.
Sarah Palin at a Donald Trump rally, referring to PTSD in the track bridge.
After joining the Army in September, Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq.
Track Pal was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case Monday night.
"When I think about what my own son is going through and what he went through when he came back, I can understand the situation of other families who are affected by PTSD and other injuries that come with our troops returning home", she said while speaking at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son's arrest as "the elephant in the room", saying "they come back a little different, they come back hard-hearted, they wonder, do the accompanying soldiers and airmen and every member of the military get any respect for what they have given to the country", she said of her son and others who have retired from the military.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, allegedly carrying a weapon and being under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing mob attacks or domestic violence.
Representatives from 10 states and the District of Columbia filed a 'Front-of-the-Court brief' in Washington on Friday in opposition to the new policy and in support of one asylum seeker.
The full name of the complainant in the "Grace vs. Sessions" lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said she was abused by her partner and "children who were members of criminal gangs", but her application for asylum was denied by US officials on June 20.
They were held in Texas.
Attorneys for the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries with widespread gang attacks and domestic violence, and where asylum seekers in the U.S. come in large numbers.
The Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014 struck down the U.S. Asylum Policy, which allows undocumented immigrants who flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The new law "is a disregard for decades of state, federal and international law", said District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine in a statement Friday.
The Federal Law requires that all claims for damages be settled on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, but such a prohibition violates that principle, the Front-of-the-Court Brief claims.
Lawyers then argued in brief that the policy of denying immigrants entry hurt the U.S. economy, saying asylum seekers are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to people fleeing gang attacks and domestic violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, said Sessions in a policy statement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day -- even the most serious problems -- asylum was never meant to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescue operations in Palu have doubled as the death toll in Patchill has doubled.
For the survivors, the situation was even more dire.
"The pressure is intense", said Reza Kusuma, a mother of 35, comforting her feverish son at one of the evacuation centers in the troubled city of Palu.
Ambulances are bringing bodies every minute.
There is no clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up waterlogged supplies and trying to move whatever they could find to safe havens.
The 7.5-magnitude quake left hundreds injured and destroyed hospitals.
Some of the injured, including Dwyane Harris, who suffered broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the continuing strong tremors.
When he remembered the quake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter, Dwayne Harris' eyes filled with tears.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
"I feel like I'm being squeezed into the rubble of the wall", Dwayne Harris told The Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I didn't hear a sound.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe somewhere.
US Ambassador accuses China of threatening with 'propaganda ads'
A week after a Chinese daily published a four-page ad in a US daily about the bilateral benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread Chinese propaganda.
The US president had mentioned the supplement provided by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - following allegations that China was trying to interfere in the November 6 election for the US Congress.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election is a new step in intensifying Washington's campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, relations between Beijing and Washington have been mired in an intensifying trade war, with both countries repeatedly raising import tariffs on each other's imports.
In the trade war, China had earlier increased import tariffs in retaliation to the US, with economists in China and the US saying the new tariffs were designed to target importing entities in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime Iowa governor and owner of one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had offended American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling down on intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own independent media", Bransted wrote in a Des Moines Register commentary on Sunday.
By placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is exploiting the freedom of speech and press that is cherished in the United States to spread propaganda, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, here in the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, you can see limited voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic path, because the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also wrote that one of China's leading newspapers "slipped away from the promise to publish" his article, but he did not specify which newspaper.
As Kavanaugh continues to ramp up his campaign, Republican analysts say women voters will be more likely to vote in the midterm elections.
As many top Republican Party leaders stand with and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has faced multiple sexual assault allegations, political analyst has warned that the Republican Party will face a blow during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment surrounding this is so high, most Republicans already seem to want to move forward with a vote.
There is no going back on these things", wrote Grant Rehr, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Rehr commented that he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Ariz.) last-minute demand for an FBI investigation would not be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or in November", said Karin Jean Pierre, senior adviser and national women's spokeswoman for the progressive group Moon, the Washington, D.C. newspaper reported on Friday.
Despite the oath of office of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, and because the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, on Friday morning, protesters demonstrated in the Senate corridor chanting "November is coming!"
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democratic Party is going to be taken off the chart", Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it is still far from over, especially among the women voters in the periphery, who are leaning back and forth, and young people between 18 and 29 who don't like the president but often don't vote".
Even before Ford's public oath explaining the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that a blow would be felt if the Republican went ahead with the confirmation.
"This is messing with the GOP", said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele earlier last week, NBC News reports.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh will be appointed to the bench, but also about the way Republicans handled the allegation and how Republicans treated the victim", said Guy Szil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, the news channel quoted as saying.
However, Americans seem to be divided on who to trust in the context of Ford and Cavanaugh's sworn testimony, and they give a slight preference to trust Cavanaugh.
A new poll by Yugav shows that 41 percent of people believe Ford's oath is either certain or improbable, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh is certain or improbable.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had either definitely or incidentally lied on his oath, compared with only 30 percent who said the same about Ford.
Following a request from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations put forward by Ford and at least one other perpetrator, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford was sworn in before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, under oath, to have assaulted Kavanaugh himself at the age of 17 while intoxicated.
Ramirez alleges that while attending a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee showed off his genitals.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is going to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The company is called InRapt, and the latest project in this tech legend is built on solid, Berners-Lee's own open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and which information to allow access to which people.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind Intrept was world domination.
"We need to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It will contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's a technology that makes Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide what type of information which people can access.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Intrept is to be a company that provides the resources, processes and appropriate expertise to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee and Bruce IBM, some on-staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the InRapt Web site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether to introduce a complete overhaul that would completely overwhelm all their business models overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post published in the Saturday Media, Berners-Lee wrote that "Intrept's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help preserve the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids".
In 1994, Berners-Lee created the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been influential in the net neutrality debate.
Although Intuit is starting, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Priest who won the Victoria Cross for his service in World War I
100 years after the only Church of England priest to receive the Victoria Cross for his role as a fighter in the First World War, his countrymen commemorated him.
Lieutenant-Colonel the Reverend Bernard Van was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 for his part in the assaults on Bellenglais and Lehighcourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled the memorial at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
Michael Van, one of his grandchildren, said the unveiling of the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning work was "vividly symbolic".
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, "through heavy ice and through shells from the field and machine guns".
He then leapt into the line of fire, displaying "great valour", leaping alone into a field-gun column, leading his battalion forward, and shooting down three of the enemy soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, a month before the war ended, Lieutenant Colonel Vane was killed by a German sniper.
"I know I have not been able to live up to my grandfather's example of courage, but it makes me humble", says 72-year-old Michael Van.
After the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, he and his brother Dr. James Vaughn presented a bouquet.
Michael Van said he was very proud to play his part in the parade, adding that the courage of a true hero is proven by the support of so many people.
MMA fans who slept through the night to see Bellator 206 had to settle for Peppa Pig.
Imagine, though, how you would feel if you slept through the night to watch the crowded Bellator 206 and were denied this important event.
Bill from San Jose, with 13 fights including six on the main card, is shown live on Channel 5 in the UK at night.
At 6am, as the fight between Gegard Moussaci and Rory McDonald was about to begin, UK viewers were shocked when coverage switched to Peppa Pig.
Those who waited until morning to enjoy the fight were disappointed.
A fan on Twitter commented that the screen turned into a children's cartoon and became "a kind of dirty joke".
"Because of government control, it was not appropriate to air that content at 6am, so they had to switch to a children's program", said Dave Shorts, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig", yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, the company would seek to create a more inclusive schedule for UK viewers.
When thinking about replay, I think we can solve this problem, said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning there, and we can't solve it until Sunday our time and Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the coverage changed, a lot of text messages flew back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, and at first we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that won't happen again.
We've cut six fights down to five, as we normally do, and I think we've given the audience more than they need.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley says he felt "uncomfortable" with sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this inspired Daly to succeed.
"Not everyone is like me", said the 24-year-old, who did not realize it until he was in high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, hosted by Lauren LaVerne, he spoke about gay rights giving others "hope".
He said that becoming a parent has lessened his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the longtime regular host of the show, was on a several-month leave of absence due to illness.
Sitting in a shipwreck on LaVerne's first programme, Dalí said that he felt "less than" others while growing up because "society didn't accept that boys and girls were liked equally".
He says: "Feeling inferior and different is the real thing that has given me the strength and drive to succeed to this day".
He said he wanted to prove he was "something" and so he wasn't disappointed when everyone finally found out about his sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist, Dalí has now become a major LGBT campaigner, using his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge more countries to legalize heterosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live in public without any negative consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
With a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, Daly, a three-time world champion, said she was "surprised" she fell in love.
He said that Dalí married an Oscar winner 20 years older than him, but age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - when Daly first competed in the Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer - he said it was difficult to meet someone of his own age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son, Robert Ray Black-Daly, which Dalí said changed his "entire outlook".
"If you had asked me last year, I would have spoken about 'I want to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there's more to life than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Following a diagnosis of brain cancer, in 2011, at the age of 40, Dalí named his son after his late father Robert.
His father never accepted that he was dying and the last thing he asked was if there were still tickets left for London 2012 because he wanted to see himself in the front row, Dalí said.
"But I couldn't say 'Dad's not there until I sit in the front row and watch,'" he said.
"I held his hand until he took his last breath, and it was only when his breath actually stopped and he died that I finally accepted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to bow to a motherland crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired him to choose his first song - Heather Sman's Pride, which resonated with him until the Olympics, and he still gets excited when he hears this song.

Mickelson was not in top form on Saturday's Ryder Cup and was not sent off.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will make history on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to refine his form to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th historic appearance at the biennial event, was dismissed by captain Jim Furyk in the foreballs and fours on Saturday.
Instead of being a regular fixture for the U.S., he spent his days in the ring, encouraging others and working on his own problems.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old was not a good hitter for the rugged Laie Golf National Course, where the grassy field punishes poor shots.
While the golf course is no longer as challenging, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is the most accurate in the ninth match on Sunday. He has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down, get off to a strong start in 12 singles matches, Mickelson's game will certainly be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his player, not saying he could say otherwise.
He fully understood what his role would be today, he knocked me out and told me that he would be ready tomorrow, Furik said.
He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a back-up, and he's contributed a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It's the end of a Ryder Cup career that doesn't match his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws. However, Furik said his presence brought to the team many things that could not be beat.
He is funny, he is fiercely sarcastic, he is funny, he likes to make people laugh, he is also a great person to be on the team, Furik said.
I think it was fun for the young players to play against him this week.
He's going to offer more than just a game.
Captain Thomas John knows that the big lead will soon be gone.
European captain Thomas John knows from experience that the unassailable lead to the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup will be broken at any moment.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 competition at Valderrama, where the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans but came within a very small margin of them at the finish line, winning by a lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.[1]
"You keep reminding yourself that there's a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at the Brookline, where we lost, we won at Valderrama, so it was just a win", said John, commenting on the class of 2018 session at Le Golf International, where John's team won with a 5-3 lead on Sunday and a 10-6 lead yesterday.
So history has shown me and the rest of the team that this is not over.
You may be bored tomorrow.
Get out of that situation fast, do everything right.
Nothing ends until you score points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that is our focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in my team, but we know who is on the other side - they are the best players in the world".
John, delighted with his team's performance on the rough golf course, added: "I can never go further than I can.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
The individual performances that are coming up tomorrow are something different.
It's great to be on the course with a partner when things are going well, but if you're on the course alone, your ability as a golfer is being tested.
That's the message you have to give to your players, that you have to bring out the best in you tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner, and he has to go and get the best out of himself".
Unlike John, the opposite attitude is for rival Jim Furyk, who asks players to perform individually rather than as partners, with the only exceptions being Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury has seen both ends of this great sporting event, which is taking place on the last day of the tournament, and he was part of the team that won in Brooklyn, which was also defeated when Europe pulled out the "Miracle in Medina".
For the final day, when asked how 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw had lined up his players, he said, "I remember every bit of it".
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you want to get a quick start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medina.
When speed goes the other way, there can be a lot of pressure in midfield.
We've set up the lineup, we've set up the players in the style that we feel is right, and you know, we're trying to get a magic out of tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with leading the rebound, and in the top match he will face Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Raham, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pulter the other Europeans coming in the first half in order.
"I went with this group in that order because I think it's inclusive in every way", John said of his singles choices.
The commissioning of the new German battleship has been postponed again.
The German Navy's newest warship was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace older, Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and snowballing costs, it will not be commissioned until at least next year, local media report.
The commissioning of the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class battleships, the "Rheinland-Falls", has been postponed until the first half of 2019, military spokesman Die Zeit reported, citing an army spokesman.
The Navy was supposed to have received the ship as early as 2014, but the fate of the Pride project was adversely affected by problems encountered before delivery.
The Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in 2007 to replace the older Bremen-class battleships.
The ships are known to be equipped with high-powered artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some classified technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature is that it does not require long-term maintenance, so it should be possible to deploy new warships far from the ports of the mother country, up to two years.
However, Die Seite argues that the continuing delays to commissioning mean that these warships with advanced technologies will be obsolete by the time they enter service; these ships are said to be the ones that allow Germany to show its strength in foreign countries.
The F125s, which suffered a disastrous fate, made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ships and sent them back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time in the history of the Navy that a ship was returned to its manufacturer after delivery.
No one knows anything about the reasons behind the ship's return, but German media reports that the ship has several critical "software and hardware failures" and therefore would be of no use to the warship if deployed on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly significant as the new Baden-Württemberg class warships will be controlled by a crew of 120 men, comprising only half the crew of the old Bremen-class warships.
Further, there have been reports that the ship is overweight and that overweight will reduce the performance of the ship and limit the Navy's ability to innovate in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to have been 7,000 tons heavier than the German carrier of World War II, twice as heavy as the ships of the same class.
Even if the hardware issues are left aside, the cost of the entire project - including training the crew - becomes a problem.
Initially expected to cost €2.2 billion, it is now said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In light of recent warnings of a declining German naval power, the problems affecting the latest warships are particularly significant.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually "missing deployable ships".
The officials said that the problems are being compounded as old ships are being decommissioned but new ships are not being received by the public.
He expressed regret that none of the new Baden-Württemberg class warships have benefited the Navy.
The National Trust has been monitoring the secret lives of bats.
A new study is being conducted at an estate in the Scottish Highlands to understand how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future bat conservation efforts.
At Inverve Gardens in West Rose, scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will monitor the common bat, the Soprano pipistrelles and the brown long-eared Dowbenton bat.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the estate to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
The mobile survey will be conducted by NHS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will help to determine the frequency of bat sounds and to determine which bat species is making the sound.
Subsequently, an ecosystem map and report will be prepared to generate a detailed landscape-wide picture of the bats' behaviour.
NTS conservation advisor Rob Dever hopes the survey results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each bat species uses them.
For bats and other related species, this information will help determine the benefits of ecosystem maintenance activities such as creating grasslands and best maintaining tree forests.
In the last century, the number of bats has declined dramatically across Scotland and the UK.
Bats are threatened by buildings, development and habitat destruction that affect their breeding grounds.
Wind turbines, electric light, flying paper, chemical treatment of construction materials, and attacks from domestic cats are all threats to bats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more useful than their eyes in capturing prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to pinpoint insects and obstacles in the flight path.
The NTS bats are being taken very seriously as they are responsible for the upkeep of over 270 historically important buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
The institute has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, perform multiple tests, and sometimes rescue the species.
The organisation has opened Scotland's first and only dedicated bat sanctuary at the Treveagh Estate in Dumfries, a sanctuary called Galloway that is home to eight of Scotland's most endemic bat species.
According to estate manager David Thompson, the property is a model area for bats.
There is plenty of room for bats here in Triev.
"There are old buildings and lots of big trees and good habitat.
But there is still a lot that is unknown about bats, so what we are doing here and on other estates will help us understand more about what is needed for bats to thrive".
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before making repairs inside buildings, because accidentally destroying a nest can kill 400 female bats and their young, and sometimes the entire area can be wiped out.
The bat is protected here, and it is illegal to kill, harm, disturb or destroy its nest.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, has appealed to the public to help.
They said: "We still have so much to learn about our bats, we don't know how many species there are and how well they reproduce".
Ronaldo, lawyers seek compensation from the magazine after denying the abuse story published by the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the abuse story against him "fake news" and said people were using his name to "make a name for themselves".
His lawyers are preparing to take the case to court against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Ronaldo, who played for Portugal and Juventus, was accused of molesting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Ronaldo allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Within hours of the allegation being reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo, speaking to his 142 million followers on Instagram live video, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, this is not a game.
They told me today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in a live stream.
"They want to make a name for themselves with my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous for using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm happy, I'm fine", the star added with a smile.
In connection with the allegations, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a defamation suit against Der Spiegel, which they described as unacceptable reporting on privacy concerns, according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the player's lawyer, said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages as serious as violation of the law", adding that "in recent times, this is one of the most serious violations of personal rights".
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorca returned to the star's room after meeting at a nightclub, where Mayorca was reportedly chatted to by Ronaldo.
Mayorca claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo knelt before him and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good man" but that he had been cheated by "one percent".
Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual relations, but the documents claim that it was consensual.
Mayorga claims that he went to the police and took photos of his injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he felt "threatened by retaliatory measures" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old said that the settlement was cancelled and legal action was taken to defame the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was set to leave Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack to join Real Madrid, and had moved to Italian giants Juve for a fee of €100 million this summer.
Brexit: UK 'forever sorry' for losing carmakers
After Brexit, UK business secretary Greg Clark said the UK would forever regret losing its position as the world's number one car manufacturer.
He added that he was "concerned" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that it would suspend production at its plant in Barnaston, near Derby, if Britain left the EU without a deal.
We need a deal, Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that if a no-deal Brexit were to take place, jobs would be lost due to the impact of delays at the country's borders.
The Burnton plant, which makes Toyota's Oris and Avenis, produced 1,50,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I think we will stop manufacturing at our factory", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Burnton.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about how cross-border trade will work in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says that the mini plant in Oxford will be closed for a month following Brexit.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the main concerns expressed by carmakers are related to supply chain risks.
Toyota's production line is based on the time of arrival of components, with components arriving at Toyota from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of components, the industry says.
The company said it was impossible to stock more inventory than was available for a day at Toyota's Derbyshire plant, so production would have to be stopped.
Theresa May's Checks and Balances plan for future relations with the EU, Clark said, was "carefully planned to avoid such checks at the border".
"We need a sense of what we want to be, not just to enjoy the current success, but to have a better sense of what allows us to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers reminds us that we have a very highly successful supply chain and we definitely need to be able to keep it that way".
Although Toyota did not say how long the production would be suspended, the company warned that in the long run, the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and result in job losses.
Peter Suvallariz, who has worked at Burnston for 24 years and is a unit union coordinator at the plant, said his members were concerned about the increased levels of concern: "In my experience once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosen Stein may be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that a crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would be delayed by a week due to the ongoing dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the president's interference in the justice system.
The question of whether or not Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and thus undermine Mueller's freedom has fueled rumours in Washington for months.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Despite reports that he was going to resign, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, he was told he would meet Trump at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he was "not interested" in firing Rosenstein but delayed the meeting to avoid it during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who alleged he had sexually abused, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, delaying the entire Senate vote again.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date has not been set for it, it will probably be this week, I think it can be postponed another week given everything else in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I'm always interested in keeping the media informed".
Some reporters will question that statement by saying Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10th.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to TV reporters' "crowd resentment", though she stated: "I don't disagree with the fact that they come in packs".
She suggested that the media and Trump would be in direct contact afterwards.
"The president is handling more Q&A sessions than his predecessors", they said.
There will be more press conferences, and Sanders said "if the media gets the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do that a lot of times, and you've seen us do it a lot of times in the last few weeks, and now instead of holding a press conference, you're going to talk to the president of the United States directly".
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries.
It's rare to have a press conference by yourself.
This week in New York, he demonstrated why, by appearing freely but strangely in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary wrote to thank the country's EU workers working on the NHS in Scotland and express their wish that they would continue after Brexit.
With less than six months to go before Britain leaves the European Union, Sean Freeman MSP sent a letter.
The Scottish Government has already offered to cover the cost of permanent residence status applications for EU citizens working in the devolved public services.
In the letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "As the summer progressed, negotiations on compromise on withdrawal between the UK and the EU continued, with expected decisions likely to be made this autumn.
But Britain has already begun preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I would like to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
The invaluable experience and skills shown by colleagues from across the EU and beyond have played a major role in strengthening and improving healthcare practices, thereby benefiting patients and society.
Scotland is your home. We want you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for a head injury following a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters he was injured just before halftime.
"He got on the sideline and he got into a mess", Reid said.
On the sidelines, coaches and medics put Abercrombie on a tractor and oxygenated him, then took him away for further testing.
An official from the State of Tennessee informed Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery from Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"There is no information available regarding the extent/type of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the accident occurred.
This was the first season at Tennessee State since redshirt sophomore Abercrombie moved from Illinois.
He had five total tackles before the end of Saturday's game, and that included 18 total tackles for the season.
Foreigners who come to the UK and buy property will have to pay high stamp duty.
Foreigners will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the Tory scheme.
This move will neutralize Corb's drive to attract younger voters.
In the UK, people who do not pay taxes will be charged more stamp duty.
The Treasury expects this to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreigners will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK - Theresa May will today announce that the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move is an attempt to block Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract younger voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting higher income groups.
The additional stamp duty will be levied on individuals and entities not paying UK taxes, and the additional money raised will support the government's move to provide housing for the homeless.
Surcharge - In addition to the current stamp duty, levied on second homes and rental homes two years ago - can be up to 3 per cent.
The Treasury aims to raise up to £120 million a year.
13% of newly built London properties are bought by people from outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing sector.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" because a good percentage of foreign buyers spend a lot of time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He alleged that property prices were rising because large construction firms were taking land but not using it and called on Mrs May to drop quotas on affordable housing to address Britain's "housing disgrace".
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rental restrictions and an end to evictions of "non-disruptive" residents.
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to restoring the British Dream, to making life better for each new generation.
That means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not true that non-UK residents and foreign companies can buy homes as easily as hardworking British residents.
The dream of many people having their own home is far away, and the shame of not having a place to sleep well remains a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate wish is to rule Scotland.'
Sunderland boss Jack Rose says his "ultimate ambition" is to manage Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott, who is currently third in League One, is challenged to revive the North-East club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a player, my ambition is to play for my country.
I got a B cap, that's all, Rose told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
But growing up with my dad in Hampden, Scotland, when I was a kid, I saw a lot of Scotland, and that's always something that's held me back.
But I will only get that chance if I manage the club".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Aloha and Latek boss says he has no qualms about succeeding established names at such big clubs. He has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"'The question for me now is whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League?'
The structure and facilities of this club make it undoubtedly in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get it there, but I'll only see success here if I can get this club back there".
Ross has spent just three years of his managerial career as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from defeat to third place, and saved Saint-Miran from defeat to win the championship title the following season.
Rose says he is happier now than his sports career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That may have been the real turning point", he says, taking over from Iowa.
"I honestly believed that management was more suited to me than playing.
It may seem strange, but I've managed to live without problems, to reach a certain height.
But playing can be difficult.
You're gonna have to go through a lot every week.
I still have my work-related struggles and pressures, but management feels pretty good to me.
I have always wanted to be in management and I am now in it. I am happy to be doing what I love at my good age".

The poll shows that the best time to drink a pint is Saturday at 5:30pm.
The extreme summer heat has boosted the loss-making pubs in Britain, putting increasing pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that sales in July were up 2.7 per cent in pub bar groups, while they were down 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
The figures were compiled by Peter Martin, CGA of a business consultancy, who said: "The consecutive summer and England's longer than expected World Cup attendance were a pattern in June and pubs in July.
The restaurant sector experienced a decline of 1.8 per cent in June, which was further down in July.
While drink-led pubs and bars performed stronger than in previous years, restaurants were in decline.
Food-led pubs also suffered in the summer, but not as much as restaurants.
People should assume that everyone is going out for a drink.
The sales of drinks in bars and pubs across the country increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food was down by three per cent".
"These results we saw at the end of April are still coming", says Paul Newman, a Lister and Hospitality analyst at RSM.
The major factors influencing sales in the markets are weather and social sporting events.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups are worried, although the year-on-year sales decline of 4.8% is in addition to ongoing price pressure.
The long summer is the most impactful for food lad operators, and it remains to be seen if the relatively mild weather in August will provide temporary relief".
The overall growth of 2.7 percent in July, including new openings in the pub and restaurant sectors, is in fact indicative of a slowdown in brand rollouts.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and reviews performance data from 47 working groups with a turnover of £9 billion. It is a benchmark in the industry.
One in five children have social media accounts that they keep hidden from their parents.
One survey revealed that one in five children - even those aged 11 and under - may have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
About 20 percent of the children said they had a main account to show their parents.
One in five children - even those as young as 11 - create social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
About 20 percent of these students say they have a clean "main" account and secret personal accounts to show their parents.
A mother who happened to see the secret website of her 13-year-old teenage daughter was shocked to see a teenager calling out to others, "Rape me".
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds have 2 profiles, half of which have secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Bucknan said: "It is an uncomfortable fact that teenagers are trying to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".

Doyle said: "I am very excited to be able to act as a voice for athletes and believe I can make my own contributions and help to drive Scotland's sport".
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals, including the 200m and 400m relay at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, and is now a regular BBC pundit, lost his mobility to a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke on this day a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell when he would recover from this.
It was a very difficult time, but I'm fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and I can now exercise with enthusiasm.
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ads that liken mothers to cows are generating controversy online.
An ad that likened nursing mothers to milking cows has generated a lot of comments online.
Consumer tech company LV advertised the product as "the world's first wearable noiseless breast pump" with an interesting music video showing the convenience of the new pump for mothers.
The lyrics read: "Yes, I milk, but you can't see the tail". and "If you haven't noticed, these are not lice, these are my breasts".
And the chorus goes, "Pump, pump, I'm giving it to the babies.
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
The video, which has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has received mixed reactions from fans, many of whom say it is about the dairy industry's "insides".
"It was a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They produce milk just like us, but they take their babies away from them within days of birth", one commented.
The LV breast pump can be placed very well inside a nursing bra.
Another commented: "It's equally difficult for mother and child to understand
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who can breastfeed their babies?"
Another added: "Ruthless advertising".
Others were in favor of the ad, with one woman commenting that the song was "funny".
"I think this is a good idea.
If I was breastfeeding now, I would.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
This ad is a little extreme, but I'm taking it as it is.
This is a good product", one commented.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad for moms (sometimes at work and in toilets) who "pump up and look like cows".
This is not a praise or criticism of the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the dancing women reveal that they all had pumps inside their bra.
The idea behind the campaign is that women who breast-pump feel like cows.
However, the LV pump is certainly convenient, with no wires or tubes, and is securely fastened inside the nursing brake, giving women the freedom to walk, pick up babies, and go outside while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Anna Balerin says: "The LV pump is truly a revolutionary product that needs a bold, stimulating start.
We have tried to highlight the disadvantages of breast pumping by comparing breastfeeding mothers and cows, and show the freedom of the new pump in a very interesting and relatable way.
This is not the first time that the LV pump has been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, the model, mother of two, used the product to catwalk for designer Martha Jacobuski.
Hundreds of immigrant children were moved to tent camps on the Texas border.
While the number of children crossing the border monthly remains unchanged, there has been a significant increase in the number of illegal immigrant children because some of the Trump administration's harsh policies make it difficult to acquire children through sponsors.
Many hereditary sponsors become undocumented immigrants and risk their own position if they come forward to take on a child.
The risk was increased in June when federal authorities called for a policy requiring sponsors and adult members of their households to submit their fingerprints and share that information with the Immigration Authority.
A senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, Matthew Albers, told Congress that more than a dozen people have been arrested for sponsoring unaccompanied minors in the past week alone.
The agency has confirmed that about 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Approximately 80 per cent of the sponsors or their families are illegal immigrants in the country, many of whom have criminal backgrounds.
So we were trying to drive them out", said Mr. Albans.
To speed up the process, officials have implemented new rules requiring children to appear in court within a month of being detained.
Instead of appearing in person before an immigration judge to file their claim for legality, most people use conference calls.
Those who are not eligible are expelled from the country immediately.
In the last few months, as reflected in the comments and reports of shelter workers, children who are detained for longer periods of time become anxious and depressed, which can lead to poor presentation and attempts to escape.
Advocates say the concerns are heightened by the fact that struggling children are more likely to be neglected in very large facilities like Torneo.
They said that sending children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare mentally or even to say goodbye to their friends only exacerbates their feelings.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Interior Minister Walid al-Maulalam called on Syrian refugees to return home as the country's war enters its eighth year.
The deputy prime minister, Muammar al-Assad, said that foreign troops are illegally present on Syrian soil in the name of countering terrorism and that they will "manage it as they wish".
"They should withdraw immediately without any means", he told the public assembly.
The "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 3,60,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, is almost over, Mawlum stressed.
He said this holy struggle will continue until "illegal aliens and terrorist groups" are "wiped out of all Syrian territory".
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria who provide training and advice to Syrian Arabs and Kurdish forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
There are over 1,000 French troops in this war-torn country.
In the case of refugees, he said it was time for them to return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading unrealistic fears" and keeping refugees out.
"We have called on the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate their return", he said.
"They are politicizing a purely human rights issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats noted that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, provided an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army in the area of three million people.
Maulalam stressed that the agreement had a definite "time limit" and expressed hope that the military offensive would target fighters, including jihadists from the Nusra Front, linked to Al-Quwaida, and " wipe them out".
UN Ambassador Stéphane de Mistura said he expected to convene the first meeting of a new committee comprising members of the ruling and opposition parties to prepare a post-war Syrian constitution and to hold elections.
The conditions for the participation of the Government in the Committee were laid out. He said that the function of the Panel should be "only to review the provisions of the existing Constitution".
Why Trump might win a second term
According to that logic, Trump could win the 2020 election, as many liberal thinkers expect, if impeachment and corruption do not end his reign.
If so, it will be the most dramatic final effort for the presidency.
So far, there has been no decline in viewership.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled on CNN to 10.5 points and MSNBC to 16 points.
Nielsen noted that prime time viewership has risen from 1.7 million to 2.4 million on average over the four years prior to Fox News. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" also tops the cable ratings with 35 million viewers.
"It's a fire that attracts people, it's not something we can understand", said Neil Baer, the show runner on ABC's "Designated Survivor".

The tough midterm House races are getting outside money.
Pennsylvania's 17th has no exaggerated cash flow, due in part to a rearrangement of congressional districts that has brought two officials into the race for the same seat.
The seat is currently held by the recently redrawn Pittsburgh Democrat, Conor Lamb, who won the seat in a special election in another district last spring.
Lamp is running against fellow Republican Representative Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which has now been redistricted to the 17th district.
The boundaries of the old districts were redrawn in January last year after the Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally misrepresented in favor of the Republicans.
The New 17 contest started a financial feud between the big financing parties, The Democratic Capital Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamp became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow majority in a widely-viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been held by the Republican Party for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a slim chance of winning.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but later withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had backed Beijing without causing significant dissatisfaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella. Trump owned a hotel in Panama, but its partners fired the management team of Trump's firm.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were only assessed against El Salvador, which received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in economic benefits and visa restrictions, are expected to make Central American countries more vulnerable, leading to higher unemployment and murder rates.
As domestic meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a meeting to review the progress of high-level discussions on security and economic prosperity, as they had last year, which was expected to be a step in the effort to contain the influx.
The high-level officials are calling for the conference to be moved forward to mid-September, which will also help consider sanctions on El Salvador.
The diplomats noted that the Deputy Prime Minister Mike Pence, who was in charge of convening the conference, had postponed it to mid-October to include senior officials in the administration sector.
Three U.S. representatives have also returned from Washington to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further notice or sanctions.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the discussion, which began with three US officials who promised to discuss the uncertainty in the US domestic situation, including diplomats.
An outside analyst close to the administration confirmed their arguments and spoke of the uncertainties.
History of the study
The next major development is the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which could be the definitive evidence in the public record of Trump's impropriety.
We know that Mueller is expanding his investigation into whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia to commit violence in our election.
If Trump and a jury of his peers at that meeting were to take responsibility for the same thing they were willing to do to the voters, is there any chance that Congress would not take responsibility?

What if Trump fires Rod Rosenthal, the deputy attorney general who's been guiding the Mueller investigation?
Rosenthal was in trouble last year for secretly monitoring the president and deeming him unfit for office.
Rosenthal says the Times's explanation is inaccurate.
"If the FBI's search report on the newly requested Brett Kavanaugh is not complete and fair, or if he is elected to the Supreme Court with sexual assault allegations and infidelity allegations going on, how will we respond?"
And if we vote for Congress in the meantime, is Trump responsible?

Ranger Graham Torrance expressed optimism in the clash with Rapid Vienna.
With a win over the Austrians earlier this month and a thrilling match against Villarreal in Spain putting them in their strongest position to qualify for Europa League Group G, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Midfielder Graham Torrance missed his first game of the season with a knee injury as Villarreal are 2-2 down, but he believes Rangers can do wonders on the springboard with that result.
"It's good for us that Villeray is in good shape", said the 31-year-old.
"When we go out there and believe we can do something, we come back with points.
This may be the last time we look at this in detail, but it will have a positive impact.
They may have played well in the first half, but we came back even better in the second half.
Thursday is a big European night.
We can hope for three points, but it's a difficult game because they have good results from their last games, but I believe with the support of our people we can do it and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult because of my injuries and the changes at the club, but now I feel a little better.
The squad is great and the players are enjoying themselves, the training is great.
I hope that we can leave the last season behind and move forward and succeed".
Women lose sleep over fears of savings in retirement.
While many of the survey respondents had clear views on how they should be protected, very few had to talk to their family members about it.
Half of the respondents in a nationwide survey said they talk to their spouse about their long-term care finances.
Only 10% of people talk to their kids about it.
Everyone needs to be protected by a family member, but many are not prepared to even take the steps to talk about it", says Holly Zinder, vice president of the international life insurance business.
This is where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children together If you do not make your wishes known in advance, you will not be able to enable your family to provide the care you desire.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and how you will receive care. These decisions are a major factor in how much it will cost.
Bring your financial advisor on the scene: Your advisor can help you by giving advice on ways to meet such expenses.
For this purpose, you can choose to take out a policy that provides traditional long-term protection for your savings, or a hybrid cash value life insurance policy that covers such expenses, or self-insurance with your own savings - as long as you have the money.
Solve your legal problems: Win legal battles.
Assign a person to your health care. This will allow you to have a trusted person in charge of your health care and ensure that professionals are working in accordance with your wishes even if you are unable to communicate.
Find an heir to your fortune.
If you are unable to do so, you can entrust the most trusted person with making financial decisions for you and paying your bills.

Can you answer questions about medications and allergies during that time?
Make sure that you include this information in a written plan.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
Relief operations officials said no information was received as all communication lines were cut in Dongla Regency, North Palau, very close to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu as a result of the earthquake.
Here are some facts about the provinces of Palu and Dongla in Sulawesi, Ireland
Palau is a very narrow inlet on the west coast of Central Sulawesi Island. Its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
The Tongalla Regency is located on the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island, about 300 km (180 mi) from the capital.
The regency is a sub-provincial administrative region with a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Tongalla, is based on fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is more concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Silvasi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, the areas of Palu and Tonggala have experienced several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In the 1938 tsunami in Tongalla, over 200 people died and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami that struck the western province of Tongalla in 1996 killed nine people.
Indonesia, which is geographically located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important recent earthquakes and tsunamis.
2004: A major earthquake struck the province of Ike, Indonesia, on December 26 in North Sumatra, was felt in 14 countries along the Indian Ocean coast and caused 226,000 deaths, more than half of them in Ike.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April 2005.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake in Java, Indonesia's most populous island, caused a tsunami that devastated the entire southern coast and killed about 700 people.
The 2009 7.6-magnitude earthquake was felt in the city of Patang, the capital of North Sumatra province.
About 1,100 people died.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake in 2010 in the Mentawai Islands of Sumatra caused tsunami waves up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
A small earthquake in the PD Regency in the province of Ike in 2016 caused extensive damage. It was a reference to the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami that had caused panic among the people.
But this time it wasn't the tsunami, it was me. 100 people died under collapsed buildings.
The 2018 massive earthquake in the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killed more than 500 people, most of them from the northern part of the island.
The quake caused thousands of buildings to collapse and thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Track Palin, has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, Alaska State Troopers reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, he had also seized the phone from the woman who tried to inform the police of the alleged crimes.
According to KTUU's report, the milk, which was held in an unsecured bond of $500, was remanded from the Other-Su Patriotic Facility.
When he was brought before the court on Saturday and asked to apologize, he replied, "Certainly not guilty", news outlets reported.
Paul faces three Class A misdemeanor charges, which carry a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was charged with one more class B felony, for which he served one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Paul has been charged with criminal offences.
He was arrested in December 2017 for assaulting his father Todd Pall.
The incident was reported to the police by his mother, Sarah Palin.
This case is pending in the VA courthouse in Alaska.
He was charged in January 2016 with domestic assault, interfering with a report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend also filed a complaint against him for being punched in the face.
In 2016, veteran group Sarah Pal criticised her son's misconduct as the reason for his service in PSTD being delayed.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The death rate is likely to rise in the coming days due to the downtime of power communication networks.
The quake was felt in Central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos of the impact of the incident have gone viral on social media.
As the tsunami approached the coast, hundreds of people gathered on the coast for the beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for the man accused of the NYC terror attack.
New York City attorneys are seeking the rare death penalty for a New York City terrorist who killed eight people in a 1953 federal crime.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov was attacked on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan with a Home Depot rental truck, resulting in the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists along the way.
According to the notice of cause of death in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death penalty, lawyers must prove that Saipov 'intentionally' killed all eight and 'knowingly' inflicted serious bodily harm.
Both these charges are punishable by death under the statute.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of aiding and abetting murder, which federal prosecutors use for ordinary organized crime, and one count of assault and destruction of a motor vehicle.
The lawyers said the method of the crime was "vile, cruel and heinous" and that such an attack required "considerable planning and planning".
"The notice of intent states that Saifullo Habibullavich Saipov has caused injury, injury and damage to the family and friends of Diego N. Ric Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, Alayane Drew and Damian Pagnuko.
Five of the victims were Argentines.
A decade after the Southern District of New York sentenced a man to death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but this was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution in the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has not expressed any remorse for the attack, days and months after it took place.
He told investigators that he was happy with his job, police said.
Saipov told authorities that the attack was inspired by seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also ordered the ISIS flag to be hoisted in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
Federal defense attorney David Patton, who appeared for Saipov, said he was "naturally disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty without the possibility of parole will increase the emotional impact of all involved", said Pathan.
Saifov's defense had earlier asked his lawyers not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "deploy the People's Army" at the Tory conference protest.
The former UK leader said politicians should "know the heat" from the Eurosceptics - one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he be put in charge of the negotiations with Europe.
If Farage had been Brexit Secretary, the UK would have 'left' by now, said Peter Bon, a real-life backbencher, at a march in Birmingham.
The Tories underlined the challenges May faces in reconciling her divided ranks by rallying in the city for a special protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to protect his Chequers Compromise Plan from attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The allies argued that they would go ahead with the deal with Brussels regardless of the setbacks - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their promise and 'the hardships'.
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Bon said he wanted to 'take out the checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels as an equal partner.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out by now", he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the chequers.'
He expressed his opposition to the European Union, saying that we are not subject to world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bonn rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election. The claim that the British people had changed their minds and wanted to stay was completely untrue.
Tory breaker Andrea Jenkins also took part in the march, telling reporters: I'm just saying: the Prime Minister must listen to the people.
The Checker is not well known among the public and the opposition is not going to vote for it, and it has not won favor with our party and the activists who have overstepped their bounds and elected us to the first place.
Please drop your checkered flags and start paying attention.
In a message referred to as Miss Maine, she added: 'The Prime Minister can only keep his post as long as he keeps his promises.
If you stand to avoid the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, then you should make the politicians in Raleigh 'feel the heat,' Farage said.
'It is a matter of trust between us - the people and our ruling class,' he said.
'They are trying to cheat Brexit but we are here today to tell them we will not let you do that.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to feel the warmth of our political class on the brink of betraying Brexit.
'We are mobilizing the People's Army of this country that gave us victory over Brexit and will never rest until we become a free and self-governing United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Remainer's marched to Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Since the group started over the weekend, a small group of Tory activists have been waving against Brexit banners.
After the start of the Lord Adonis Conference from the Labour Party, the Conservative Party mocked the security concerns Apple faced.
These are the people who tell us that the IT systems are right and that Canada Plus Plus has all the technology, frictionless borders, unrestricted free market in Ireland.
This is a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to watch the presidential election closely.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully consider running for president after the November elections.
The Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in West Sussex, Massachusetts, on Saturday, the Boston Globe reports.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running against GOP state representative Geoff DeHael in the November re-election. DeHael was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's in the middle of speculation about whether she'll take Trump's place in 2020.
The 36th meeting of the constituent members in the town hall format since taking office was held in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon.
One of the participants asked if they were running for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix their broken system, and that would include another woman.
LSU's arrest in the shooting death of Sims confirmed.
Police in Baton Rouge said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was announced at an 11 a.m. ET news conference by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
They asked for help identifying the man in the footage and released video footage of the shooting Friday night.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed outside the Southern University campus Friday morning.
"Wade Sims had a gunshot wound to the head, which is the cause of death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wade was defending his friend, and Simpson was shooting.
Simpson was questioned about the weapon and admitted to being at the scene and that Wade had shot Simpson.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department without incident.
The 6-foot-6-inch junior Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, including 10 starts, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton ends his world title after the team handed over the order to beat Sebastian Haase.
It was clear from that moment on that Valtteri Bottas had qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday for a race where Mercedes' team orders played a big part.
Boats had made a good start to the race, and defending his position in the first two laps, Hamilton was badly pressured to attack teammates.
The home run went to Pitts first and it was crucial that Hamilton was allowed to drive in Wallet's traffic.
Mercedes had previously taken a lap to take the lead, but Hamilton went ahead after wheel-to-wheel action, cutting the Ferrari driver who had avoided the risk of being caught in a grudging hold after a double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his twenty-first birthday.
After a quick finish, he was held on the tyres for much of the race and finished fourth behind Kimi Raikkonen.
He finally reached the pits on lap 44 and was unable to improve on the eight laps remaining, so Raikkon finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Voltaire did so well and was the gentleman who asked me to leave.
The team did the impossible to resist", Hamilton said.
That was definitely rude body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein's argument at a rally on Saturday that she had not leaked a letter written by Christy Blaisford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Cabanok of sexually assaulting her.
While the letter, which the president delivered directly to Ford at a rally in West Virginia, was not referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he said what was happening in the Senate was a "show to the people of how selfish, disloyal and bad people are".
"The beautiful things that are happening in the Senate right now are likely to happen when you see people with anger and selfishness and bad manners and disloyalty", he said.
If the news gets out, they'll say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember?
Diane Fane Stein, did you leak?
I remember their response -- did you leak the document -- "Oh, oh what?"
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak it".
Oh, wait a minute.
"We leaked... no, we didn't leak", he added, mimicking the senator's face.
It was Fane Stein who sent the letter in July explaining the allegations made against Ford and it was leaked in the early days of September - but Fane Stein denied it was leaked from his office.
"I did not try to hide Dr. Ford's allegations, and I did not release his story", Fane Stein told a committee, The Hill reported.
They asked me to keep it a secret, so I did.
But the president was not comfortable with their protest, and he said at a rally on Saturday night, "I'll tell you, that was very bad body language".
Maybe they didn't, but they showed a body language that they never saw".
The president said that while Democrats continue to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, they may be making accusations on their behalf.
"They have decided to take back power by any means necessary.
You can see their selfishness and bad nature, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to follow to get power and control", the president said, according to the Mediator.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by defeating
Patrick Doyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars fought back with a 5-3 win in Dundee on Saturday after a Friday's Elite League defeat to Belfast Stakes.
The Giants had already taken a two-goal lead with strikes from Patrick Doyer and Francis Belvoir.
Mike Sullivan and John Crowney were bringing home the home run before the Giants' lead was restored.
Francois Bouchard tied for Tandy before Lucas Lenduwald Nelson scored the winning goal.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefi's men from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams. The Giants won all three games.
With Kendall McFaul in the fourth, Dwyer opened at 3:35 and David Rutherford doubled the lead with Bellover four minutes later.
After a busy opening period, Sullivan brought home the home team to 13-10 before Matt McCourt equalized at 15:16.
At the end of the first half, Drauer scored his second goal of the night to ensure the Giants' lead before the first break.
The home side group regrouped and Bouchard once again included them in the level teams with a 27-37 power play goal.
With Crowney and Charles Cor Coren, he helped Neil Sunne for the first time in the match to give Dunne Dick the lead late in the second period and secured his team's fifth-half victory in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will head to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died trying to prevent a plane carrying more than 100 people from crashing into an earthquake.
An air traffic controller who died in Indonesia while preparing to land a plane carrying hundreds of people safely became famous after his death.
The large earthquake on Friday killed more than 800 people and left many missing on the island of Sulawesi, which also caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are affecting the area, with many trapped in urban rubble.
Antonio Guenavan Agung, 21, was forced to quit his job after several of his colleagues escaped with their lives from the control tower at the Siza Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in the office to ensure the safe departure of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
He then jumped from the control tower, mistakenly thinking it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesia's air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirit commented that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We had arranged a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a large hospital in another city.
But we lost him this morning before the chopper got to Palo.
He added, "This is heartbreaking news.
Meanwhile, the country's disaster mitigation agency said officials feared the death toll could be in the thousands due to poor access to Dongla, CGI and Baotung.
Agency spokesman Zutopo Parvo Nagrao said the death toll was likely to rise as many people were not able to reach and many bodies were under rubble.
Waves of over 20 feet broke through the Palau, prompting a mass burial on Sunday.
Military-industrial aircraft are providing services and supplies.
"Bodies are being brought in by ambulance every minute", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who told Sky News.
Fresh water is very scarce.
"Small markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfond, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross has been on the scene looking for survivors of the disaster, but we don't know what they might see there.
This is a major disaster, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "You must complete all evacuation operations day and night.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
In Indonesia, earthquakes struck Lombok earlier this year, killing 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing after the Laguna plane crash
The airline flying the plane that crashed in Pacific Lagoon, Micronesia, reported one person missing, and earlier said that the 47-person crew had been safely evacuated from the crashed plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was not located.
The airline said it was in contact with local authorities, hospitals, investigators, and the search for the missing person.
The airline did not respond to requests for further information on the age and nationality of the missing person.
Local boats have come to the rescue of passengers and crew of the plane that crashed and sank while attempting to land at the Chuck Island airport.
According to officials, seven people were admitted to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said six people were in hospital on Saturday and all of them had passed emergency status.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and exactly how it happened.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed before it reached the runway at the lagoon.
Some witnesses said the plane appeared to have missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in too low.
"That's a very good thing", said Jeans.
Jeans said he and his fellow passengers struggled to get to the emergency exit through the waist-deep water of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were scared and screaming and he had a minor head injury.
Sailors involved in a nearby bridge upgrade helped to bring people ashore using a wind-powered boat, which helped to save the entire crew within about 30 meters (100 feet) of the plane's descent into the water, the US Navy said.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in crashes involving PNG-registered aircraft over the past two decades, but none of them involved Air New Guinea.
The timeline of the woman's burning alive at night is being released by the analyst.
The prosecution heard the case of the defendant in the 2014 case of burning a Mississippi woman alive.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together details of the exact night's movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telles and the 19-year-old deceased Jessica Chambers.
Contrary to his earlier claims, Clarion Ledger reported that using location information collected from multiple cellphones, he learned that Telles was with Chambers on the evening of the incident.
The defendant was in the vicinity of his friend Michael Sanford at the time of the alleged assault, and cellphone records indicate that he was in close proximity to Chambers, and police spoke to Sanford.
But Sanford took the position on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the lawyer if Telles was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "It's a lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Telles said they had known each other for two weeks when Chambers died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
After Chambers' death, Teles said, Chambers' messages and calls and contact information were removed from the phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defendant's final hearing is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he expects to release the case for sentencing on the same day.
The Hybrid: What is Conscious Hip Hop?"
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of art by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The Hybrid from Bristol, hip hop has moved away from the kind of dignity that highlights political messages and social issues.
They want to bring hip hop back to its roots and re-populate hip hop consciously.
Artists like Fugees and Common have recently had a renaissance across the UK with artists like Atkal and Loki.
Another black woman?!
A New York lawsuit was filed against the couple for a "racist" message.
A New York couple is sued for racial harassment after receiving a text from their mother complaining that they are "another black person".
The couple denied racial charges, saying the case was a form of robbery.
Giselle Morris, a mother of two, was upset to learn that she was black on her first day at work in 2016 when she came to see her child.
"Oh, another black woman", says Lindsay Plasco-Flexman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, they switched people and sent it to Maurice twice.
When Amaly learned of the "disturbed" Placebo Flex Man, the New York Post reported that he left Morris saying that their predecessor was African American, that they were doing a terrible job, and that he was referring to a Filipino.
Maurice was paid a day's wages and sent home in an Uber.
The Morris couple are now seeking a six-month salary of $350 a day as compensation for their dismissal. This is said to be the salary that Muff had promised them, but there are no agreements.
"I will make them understand that they should not do such things", she said in a post on Friday, adding, "I just understand that this is discrimination".
The couple have denied that they are racist and say that after being hurtful towards them, they had no choice but to be fired because they cannot be trusted.
"My wife sent them a message that she didn't mean to say".
But they're not racist.
"We are not racist", her husband, Joel Place, told the Post.
"But even if you were mistaken, would you be willing to entrust your children to the person you treated harshly?
Your newborn?
Not at all".
Describing the case as a "scam", Plasco said his wife had only been with the baby for two months and they were "in a very difficult situation".
"Would you go after someone like that?
I don't think that's a good thing", he added, who is also an investment banker.
Although the case is still going on legally, the verdict quickly discredited the couple on social media, discrediting their behavior and reasoning.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not agree with the book, The Talking Bear.
In a letter, Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote: "Before it was published, it was very difficult to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who was reading it for the first time.
It's interesting to see what we now know about Paddington's great success".
Inspired by a small doll, she said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing the book, was confident even when the work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the work after his death was "very sweet and heartwarming".
She described Paddington as "a very important member of the family", and added that her father was very proud of the achievement.
"He was a very quiet man, who did not like to brag", they said.
Paddington was real to him, just like you have a really smart kid, and no matter what we do, we're gonna be proud of what they've accomplished.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he credited Paddington with it.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
She and her daughter were rushed to the Hôpital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors made a tireless effort to save her life.
"Nad would call to say she was in a terrible condition, and she didn't expect to survive", said Ms. Ednan-Laperos.
"Then I got a call from Nad, saying she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did exactly that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey".
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to pump her heart was slowly leaving her body, leaving her body.
She died shortly before this was stopped.
I had to wait there, watching all this.
I couldn't cry or scream, I was surrounded by my family and others.
I had to struggle to contain everything.
Slowly grieving the loss of her daughter, Mrs. Ednan-Laperos, in the midst of her intense pain, boarded the plane with the other passengers.
"No one knew anything", they said.
"I kept my head down, tears always running down my cheeks.
It was hard to describe, but it was on the plane that I felt sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and care.
I knew how much he loved her".
Sad women throw postcards to prevent suicides from bridges.
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers of people to call for help are dropped on Willish Bridge by Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries.
Davis' son, Taylor, had suffered from depression since he was 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I wish no other god had to suffer as I did", she said.
A 45-year-old woman in Lidney, Davis, remembers her son growing up to be a chef and a man with an attractive smile.
"He was known to all by his smile.
They always said his smile would light up a room".
Before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a completely dark place".
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was only 11 at the time, found him dead by suicide.
"I was always worried about the outcome", says Ms. Davis.
Miss Davis created the cards to let people know that you have a lot of people around you, including friends, to ask for help and talk to.
Don't be silent - you have to talk.
Miss Humphries, a friend of Miss Davis's for many years, lost her partner Mark at the age of 15, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He never said anything about being sad or depressed or anything", they said.
"We noticed a change in his behavior in the days before Christmas.
When the children unwrapped their diapers on Christmas Day, he did not look at them or say anything to them.
They said that his death was a great tragedy for them, but they could only bear it. "It left a huge gap in the family.
We were all pulled apart.
But we had to fight and move on".

As the FBI investigation begins, Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance.
"I felt that if we had got what he wanted - a time-bound inquiry, a limited inquiry - it would have brought some unity", Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he feared the PET committee would "crumble" in a biased clutter.
Why don't Cavanaugh and his Republican aides want the FBI investigating?
Time is the reason for their dissatisfaction.
With just five weeks to go until the November 6 midterm elections, if the Republicans do not win as much as expected, their efforts to get their man on the nation's highest court will be in jeopardy.
George W. Bush calls the senator and lobbies to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House, and he meets Bush, his personal secretary, and his wife, Ashley.
What happens if you file an FBI report?
The Senate, currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is up for election.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, and once he does, Vice President Mike Pence could end his conspiracy and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean converts is declining.
The South Korean lawmaker said that since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, there has been a decline in the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea.
Citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, Park Byung-seok said that there were 2,076 converts in 2011, up from 1,127 last year.
Park said the main reasons were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of higher tariffs on smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most North Korean converts have been granted citizenship by South Korea over time.
Seoul says that about 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have crossed through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats these converts as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them to the country.
Relations between the North and the South - although still virtually at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for stalled talks on denuclearization.
This comes after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, in which they agreed to work together to make the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free.
But as there has been little progress, North Korean Foreign Minister Ryong Ho on Saturday blamed the US sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there is no guarantee of our international security, so we cannot initially implement unilateral disarmament", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Brett Kavanaugh is "crazy" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, says Nancy Pelosi.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a lunatic and said she was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court by nature.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman spoke like that now, they would call her a lunatic", Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that Dr. Christine Blasie Ford had sexually abused her when they were both teenagers.
He was very emotional at times when talking about his family and high school days, raising his voice and carrying on.
Kavanaugh openly blamed the Democrats on the committee, saying that all the allegations against him were "mysterious and coordinated suicide" orchestrated by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was showing anti-Democratic attitudes.
"I think that such statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats make him unqualified", she added.
When asked if she would impeach him if Kavanaugh was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi expressed disappointment.
"What I'm saying is -- if he's not willing to tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court, and he doesn't deserve to be in his current position", Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
As a Democrat, Pelosi added that she was concerned about how Kavanaugh's policies would be against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, especially when he is considered a conservative jurist.
In his confirmation arguments, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether some Supreme Court decisions could be overturned.
"This is not the time for a mad, easily influenced person to go to court and say, 'That would be great,'" Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's a legitimate insult, a deep rage after months and years, but they can't show it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Miss Steinmeier told me 45 years ago.
"I don't find it anything unnatural, do you?"
She continued, "I had a woman who was an executive at a place that helped me a lot. She said that when she was angry, she would cry, and she said that she had developed a habit of crying when she was angry.
I'm angry with you".
And then they went on.
And I thought it was a very smart decision".
Crying is also permissible in the face of increasing anger, but it is fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my previous job, I was crying one day in an office with a majority of male employees, in an expressionless rage, when a woman older than me, a manager I had always looked at in awe, grabbed the scarf around my neck and pulled me down the stairs.
"They must not see you cry", they told me.
"They don't know you're so angry.
They think you're too upset, so they're just happy to make you happy.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with him in Gary Hart's race for president.
In 1987, when Hart was pulled from the board of Monkey Business for improper conduct and removed from the race, Ms. Schroeder was very disappointed and thought there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision", she told me with a smile 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates who never wanted another.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, they were behind in raising money, so they vowed not to compete until they had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
Some of her supporters gave the men $1,000, but they found that they were only paid $250.
She wondered, "Do they think I will benefit?"
She was very emotional when she stated in her speech that she was not running an official campaign - her gratitude to her supporters, her anger at the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters from representatives, her anger at gender discrimination - all of which took her breath away.
"Everybody thought I was going to be nervous", said Schroeder, recalling the media's reaction to him.
"You may have thought that the Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
"I remember thinking, 'What are they going to put on my grave?'
"Did she cry?"
How the US-China trade war benefits Beijing
The expert said that the split between the two countries would be beneficial to Beijing as the US and China hear the waves of the trade war and the war is not over.
US President Donald Trump earlier this year threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese exports of solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most important event of the week was the new price data for about $200 million worth of goods, which have been taxed for almost half of the total goods coming from China to the US.
Each time Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently raising tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on 60 million U.S. goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the US, and the world's second largest economy is not going to lose its shine anytime soon.
To turn Washington away means to bend to the US's commitments, but to publicly bend to the US is shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say that if Beijing can do things right, the U.S. trade war pressures will reduce the interdependence between the two economies and things will turn out in China's favor in the long run.
"If a really sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing causes an economic collapse in either country, the consequences are likely to be more dangerous than observers have concluded", observed Abigail Grease, a research associate with a special interest in Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says Interior Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country after seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Maulaam said that the country's infrastructure is improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure due to the progress made in countering terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing efforts to normalize and rehabilitate the provinces devastated by terrorists.
Terrorism and unilateral economic policies have affected their daily lives and forced them to leave the country.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people living in the country are also in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maulalam said the Syrian government would accept all kinds of assistance to rebuild the shattered country.
He stressed that the United States will not accept help from countries that have tried to create unrest or from others on terms.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup again in Paris
Team USA defeated Team Europe to win the 2018 Ryder Cup. The team won the final at Le Golf National in Paris, France with a final score of 10 .5 - 16 .5.
This was the sixth consecutive defeat for the United States on European soil, and they have not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Jørn, Europe once again won the title, scoring 14.5 points to beat the United States.
U.S. player Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, put his tee shot in the water on the par-3 16th hole, losing the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-5 in the tournament since its inception in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost to Denmark's Thorb John Olsen, the lowest ranked player on the European team, in the 5&4
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who was playing in what may be the final Ryder Cup of his career.
Having played in eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia is one of the tournament's all-time leading scorers with 25.5 points.
"I'm not a crybaby, but I couldn't help myself this time.
It's been a rough year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and for trusting me.
I'm very, very happy to have the Cup back.
It's all teamwork and I'm happy to be able to help with that", said Garcia, excited about the European win.
He handed the torch to his teammate John Raham who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 on Sunday.
"I am very proud to beat Tiger Wood, I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Raham.
Tiger Woods has lost all four games in France, and now he has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
With 14 major titles - only Jack Nicholas has more - one of the greatest players of all time, he had some strange tactics.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who had performed exceptionally well throughout the tournament, Team USA struggled throughout the weekend.
"I'm proud of them, they fought", said U.S. captain Jim Furyk after his team's disappointing performance.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
But we were broken.
Greetings to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
And they all played well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 and I'm proud to be their captain.
You are to be commended.
He just played better than us".
Red Tide news: Reduced intensity in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decline in red tide ratios along the Tampa coast.
According to the FWC, patchier bloom conditions have been reported in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, indicating a decrease in severity.
In coastal areas from the northern Peninsula to southern Lee, red tides (tide waves) can be seen rising up to about 130 miles per bluff.
Patches were visible in Hillsborough County 10 miles from the coast, but it was less than the last sightings.
Red tide was also observed in the Pasco area.
Last week, there were moderate and low intensity in coastal areas of Pinellas County, low and high intensity in coastal areas of Hillsborough County, very low or high intensity in Manatee County, very low or high intensity in coastal areas of Sarasota County, very low or moderate intensity in Charlotte County, very low or high intensity in coastal areas of Lehigh County, and no reports of tidal activity in the low-lying area of Korea.
Respiratory difficulties continued in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
But there have been no reports of respiratory distress in northwest Florida in recent weeks.
