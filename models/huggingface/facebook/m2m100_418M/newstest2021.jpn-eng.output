The young warrior, Tyler Hero, who is responsible for the future of Heat, is again praised by Butler, “Thinking is not Lucky’s way” (Basket count) – Yahoo!
Photo=Getty Images Heat’s first match is against Kings.
This match, which won 104-98, Dunken Robinson scored 18 points in the team high, 15 points followed by Tyler Hero and the back coat's performance.
Robinson, the league's top shooter, will, of course, become an important element for Heath, the 13-th nominated Lucky, the hero's step-up.
The hero missed 15 matches from February to March due to his leg injury, and the last of the 12th March's Honnets match, which was a return match, entered the season into a long interruption period.
Hero says, “I was able to restore 100% condition because I had a lot of time, it’s the best feeling I’ve ever felt,” but the performance in Scream was more convincing than the words.
The hero's play time increased due to the delay in the fusion of the pioneering point guard, Kendrick Nane, and the shape survived the opportunity.
It’s a good thing to do with 15 points above that’s worth a lot.
Team Leader Jimmy Butler also praised the hero of "My Favorite" this time.
“He’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man, he’s a man.”
From the beginning of this season, Battler likes the hero's unbeatable strength and the stitching attitude to deal with basketball.
That’s why I’ve been invited to start personal training at 4 a.m. and we’ve been training together.
But Butler once said, “He says his opinion to anyone and does not withdraw; such a struggle can be respected.”
The baller is the kind of one who always speaks what he thinks, and if he thinks it will be for the team, he is aware that the conflict will happen.
As a result, the relationship with the team fell worse in the past.
But Butler is going to be the hero of his youth.
The character of the batler, which is sometimes too harsh for the teammate, is a good guide for those who have enough gats to come about it.
If the relationship of two teachers who respect each other affects the whole team, Heath will be able to become a team that will go further up.

Internet information detects crises instantly and demonstrates (JBpress) - Yahoo! news
“I want to know quickly where the disasters and accidents occurred!”
This has a strong need not only for news agencies such as television and newspapers, but also for many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
The service that responds to it is the “specty” developed by Spectee, which manages information analysis by AI.
In an alert from Specty, a team of experts will determine the truth of social media information.
Now, the first way people know about the occurrence of disasters and accidents is moving from television to the internet (social media).
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important media to communicate information immediately after disasters and accidents occur.
It is difficult for people to always watch the full information and get out useful information from it.
Specty has the ability to detect and analyze the content from the information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook about natural disasters and accidents, and to distribute the information to the user companies in order to determine the truth of information.
“Position a wide range of negative impact events that stop or stagnate social activities as a ‘crisis’” (CEO representative of 村上建治郎) is a crisis management support service that visualizes the various crises that occur within and outside the country.
The NHK during the Bearland earthquake that occurred in April 2016 was the first major use case in Specti, after which the recruitment movement spread rapidly among enterprises.
Not only television stations and newspapers, but also companies supporting social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transport, and more than 350 local companies across the country, including local governments, are currently using specti.
Analyze the post and determine the type and place of the “crisis”
Specty delivers information in four stages: “Information Collection”, “Analysis and Content Classification”, “Title” and “False Judgment”.
The use enterprises shall specify the areas to gather information (e.g. the towns and towns) and the categories of crisis (e.g. disasters and accidents).
Specty collects posts that belong to its designation using the API provided by social media.
Then analyze and classify the texts, images, and videos that are included in the collected posts.
For example, if there is a video that shows a fire car, a black smoke rises from the building, and an orange fire rises from the room, it is classified as "fire".
In addition, if the image of the crossed car is classified as "travel accident" and if the image of the water-covered road is classified as "road crown water".
Specty also makes estimates of the place of disasters and accidents occurring.
"There are many things that we don't know where from the post, so we're gathering different information and guessing," said the CEO of the village.
For example, if a picture or video shows a road mark or mark, it extract the location name information from it and identify the location in connection with the location name database.

The city is nearby to Tokyo.
I have lived in the province for less than 30 years since I was born.
The “zulu mix” which means “cover” was used in a conversation with a friend from the university (Tokyo) for a moment as a quoton.
I could understand the meaning of flow and speech, but it was said by the Tokyo citizens, Saitama Prefecture people, "Do not use it."
“That’s true that you’re going to go through and go through?”
If you are connected, you can somehow guess the meaning.

Japan’s “cold Chinese” is not the Chinese.
“Cold Cakes” Unpopular Wake (Modern Business) - Yahoo!
China calls it “Japanese cold food”
As mentioned in the beginning, Cold Chinese is a Japanese-born Chinese cuisine (Japanese Chinese) designed on the basis of China's "Cold Mixed Side (Ranbanmian/Cold Mixed Side)".
Therefore, it does not originally exist in China, but from the diversification of food, it has become visible in Japanese cuisine in the summer.
Also recently, in the day-to-day shops, there are also arange products marked as ‘Japanese meat cool/meat cool and Chinese’ and ‘川香鶏丝涼面/四川風鶏 cool and Chinese’.
On the other hand, pushed by popular Chinese foods such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine, Japanese Chinese popularity in China is not at all high.
Of course, the Japanese Chinese taste is often familiar to the Chinese.
Therefore, it’s not unpleasant, but it tends to be badly appreciated.
“Cold China” is not an exception, it is still a minor existence in China.
As a result, the cold Chinese name in China is "Japanese Cold Cakes".
The Chinese are recognized as one of the Japanese foods.
In the summer, it’s “Cold Skin”.
In China, the food that feels summer is not “cold skin” (rampy).
In Japan, I think many people are unfamiliar, but the cool skin is made of Shenzhen (Shenzhen) province-born grain powder, rice powder, dampon, and so on.
It is true that it has 2000 years of history.
With a fixed order of B-Class rubber sold in the house, the price is 10-20 yuan (150-300 yuan) in front and after, it is very affordable.
"Cold" has the letter, but it is not as cold as Japanese and Chinese.
The normal temperature is basic.
On the fats, a thousand-cuted curry, garlic, cooked moyachi, etc., top the favorite material, add the flavour such as pacchi, don cyan, ginseng, garlic.
Finally, mixed with sauce, peanut oil, ashes, peanut paste and peanut paste, specialized flavours are completed.
Thus, in the midst of the mouth, the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouth.
Also, because it is penetrated throughout China, there are various topings and flavours, and the variety is also a characteristic of cool leather and one of the ways to enjoy.
Experts explain!
“Cold Water Shower” Brings Merits to Your Body and Mind – Yahoo!
Prevent muscle pain and inflammation.
A study published in the North American Journal of Medical Sciences, which examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (water therapy) found that the effects on physical and mental healing could be expected.
Drinking cold water after exercise can reduce muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Cassa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute for Sports Medicine, who teaches at Connecticut University, “It is important to exercise and take a cold water shower as long as possible.
Reduce fatigue.
When you exercise at a high temperature, your heart, muscles and skin will need more blood flow than usual.
“With exercise, the heart rate increases, the blood flow to the heart increases, and the muscle flow increases because it requires energy to compress the muscles, and when it comes to the skin, a lot of blood flows to regulate the body temperature,” says Professor Casas.
“With a cold water shower, the temperature of the skin is lower, so it can halt the blood flow that is sent to the skin; instead, the blood flow is sent to the internal organs, such as the stomach, so it makes it easier to consume water and nutrition even after exercise.
Hopefully the hormone effect.
Droshevsky also explains that you can expect the start of the "Hormis effect" by swimming cold water.
The Holmesic effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of substances and stress that are harmful to the body than not at all.
“Low oxygen exercise, fasting, and cold water shower are representative examples of the hormone effects that can be expected for health: cold water shower can stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, and increase physical and physical strength and recovery.”

Paris Saint-Germain, who defeated Santiago 1-0 in the Coupe de France final held in Stade de France on 24 local time, won the 13th in two years.
PSG has won two national crowns.
Neymar's goal in the first half to drop Santetine in the Neymar's final point becomes the final point and PSG has achieved two domestic crowns after the League One, but it's in a situation that you don't have to worry about the Champions League in August.
Kilian Embape, who first appeared in the same battle, was in the situation of being injured by the adversary C.B. Royke Perlan's malicious sliding tacks.
In the first half of the 30 minutes, a young French star, who was defeated in a form that was intertwined with his right leg, scratched his face with pain.
Thro this game, the players of both teams were fast and struggling.
Amber, who seems to have scratched his right foot, is unlikely to continue playing.
A red card was presented to Perlan.
After the match, Embape, who fixed his right foot, left the stadium in a shelled shell.
PSG will play the Cup-du-la-League final with Lyon at 4:10 a.m. on 1 August Japanese time, but it will not be possible to take Embape in this match.
We have to wait for the medical reports from the club to be published, but there is a possibility that the Champions League will be missing in Portugal.
Colona Accident "Arts Near" Online Museum "HASARD" (from eighth) launch (Daily East North Newspaper) - Yahoo! news
There is a museum where anyone can touch art for free when he wants.
It takes place from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustaf Crimto to an unknown artist in the country.
The online museum "HASARD (Azer)" has since its "open" in April 2019 captured the minds of users from its convenience and novelty, and has increased its attention to the opportunity for a new lifestyle caused by the Colona Disaster.
The site was launched by the representative of Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland, Oakland.
When you visit Azar, you will be surprised by the abundance of the exhibition and the beauty of the image.
24 days now publishes a total of 14 exhibitions of permanent exhibitions and project exhibitions, attracting people to see works of ultra-high resolution that communicate not only colors but also the sensation of the pen.
Membership registration and entrance fees are not necessary, not only the viewing side, but the artists who want to open the individual exhibition also do not cost.
The online show is also attracting attention.
Moving the painting is one thing.
Clood Monet's permanent exhibition "It begins to move again" provides digital processing so that clouds, flowers, grass and so on move.
“I want those who are less interested in art to be able to enter” (no representative) from the thought, I taste the feeling of being in the painting.
The art and art meetings were at the time of primary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Yunnan Prefecture Museum with my family, I saw the three huge paintings of Mark Shagall’s “Aleco” and was shocked by the hardness of it.
From the next day the class of art changed to a pleasant time, and even after going to Kyoto for college, he began to take his feet to the gallery and so on.
At the same time, the museum is not close, the large project exhibition is only held in the capital area, and many people have not much opportunity to get into touch with art from different perspectives, such as difficult to get out with childbirth.
There, along with working in IT-related companies, I spent about two months and launched a site that can view art on the internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the expansion of the new corona infection.
Whenever anyone wants to see, he can see art in a free way.
The goal of Azar was accepted by more people by Corona's disaster.
The representative emphasizes that he will enrich his imagination about the meaning of art observation.
“When your imagination becomes rich, you will be able to give hands to those who are in trouble.
I want art to become a better society.”
China’s quality age is over and Japan’s quality age is coming – Yahoo!
Pandemic change of values.
There are many predictions and discussions about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, the 8th July article “The work of the ‘management’ now begins to disappear in Japan ... ! its cruel reality” and the 4th July article “In the world of ‘After the Colona’, the ‘Japan Manufacturing Industry’ is likely to resurrect ... !” may have a change to occur.
Only Japanese do not know the reality of "Japan's strength" ... an unusual reality seen in Asia
It also appears that the current of the 26th June article “Total Burning Minds” to the people who became aware of the end of their lives in Colona” and the 10th June article “Colona, now full of rebellion, I’m going to review the effectiveness of the “God’s Prayer of the Difficult Time” will become the mainstream.
And what seems to be clearly visible to our eyes as the combination of the two “material (economic and business)” and “spirit” is the great stream of “from Chinese quality to Japan quality”.
For example, if you have a bad or defect in a T-shirt or shirt, it’s angry, but there’s no other thing in the life of the person who has bought it.
On the contrary, the high quality of Chinese-made masks and artificial respiratory devices which have recently been discussed ... "China quality" in such life and safe products is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, such goods cannot be purchased.
You will be looking for goods of "Japanese quality" at a fair price.
Of course, this trend does not happen only in Japan.
It is also clear that the Western countries, where the lack of masks and medical equipment is in a difficult situation, have yet done "return" by the "Chinese quality" too bad, one by another.
Safer than safe.
Also, goods such as cars are goods that defects can be fatal (death from accidents).
Whatever the countries that start China and South Korea are attacking in the “Safe or Evil” sales strategy, the Japanese manufacturer will not be able to hit too much, and the situation as stated in June 16’s article “Do you win alone, the world’s automaker will fall into Toyota?” is because the “Japanese quality” is strongly demanded for the product called the automobile.
And this pandemic reminds us that many other goods also need "safe and safe".
Furthermore, safety and safety are important not only in "Japan quality in manufacturing" but also in "Japan quality in services such as logistics".
Like the toilet paper bullying, the production capacity is proper, but sometimes the intermediate circulation is unable to reach the hand.
Furthermore, as the article of April 17 “Who is the real murderer of the lack of mask, don’t let the fireplace thieves of the Chinese Communist Party regime,” it made it painful that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of “satisfaction and safety”.
If there is, it is very important that each country has its own priority and that it is possible to acquire masks (medical equipment) and foods in its own country.
South Korea's new corona infected in 115 days over 100 people - overseas flow with the highest number of people (United News) - Yahoo!

Nagoya & Maharaja players Colona Positive Football J1, League Re-Open After First Shizuoka News Ates
Football J1 Nagoya announced on 25 May that it was confirmed that the DF宮原和也 player (24) had a positive reaction to the new corona virus.

The tephron processing freepane derived white paint, it is revealed that it will increase the cooling effect with cut heat!
A great discovery!
This year it was a high rain season with unusual rainfall, but the hotest summer will be clearer.
The hot and hot days, even the cold rooms, will work worse... you just imagine it, don’t you think?
The global warming is a major global issue, and how to overcome the hot summer a little more comfortable, humanity has limited wisdom.
One way is to wear thin white clothes.
You don’t have to wear black clothes that absorb the heat in the summer.
And the same principle applies to the architecture of the house, and the number of cases that use white paint is increasing.
White is white, and it is not possible to paint the characteristics that reflect more light and does not absorb heat, and that was also the latest field of research.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) announced in collaboration with researchers from the Faculty of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Columbia that it has discovered the most efficient method of combining white paint that can reverse solar heat and boost the cooling effect inside the building.
Early implementation is aimed at.
The white paint with the highest rate of sunlight reflection was titanium oxide, which reached 85% reflection.
White paint that already uses titanium oxide is painted on the roofs of high-temperature buildings, etc., and has been helped to block solar heat and improve cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered is the white paint that is derived from the polytetrafle oroethylene (PTFE) foxine grass, which is used in the tephron processing freepan and so on.
The white paint that applies this tephronic effect reflects the sunlight to close to 98%, allowing a substantial heat cut.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using the infrared tephron, the house is easy to spend without being exposed to heavy heat.
This time may come near, right?
The roof of the Japanese house seems to have a lot of dark colors, but now the white system will become the mainstream?
Amazon’s annual big sale, when will it take place this year?
The U.S. Amazon Dotcom has revealed the delay of the annual big sale “Prim Day”, the U.S. CNBC on July 21.
It is held in July each year, but it was to be forced to postpone this year due to the impact of the expansion of the new coronavirus.
“The details will be announced soon,” Amazon’s advertiser said in a statement.
“Premium Day has become a special celebration event that we have been looking forward to in the past five years: this year it will be held in a later period than the usual year while ensuring the safety of employees and supporting customers and producers.”
However, while saying that "the details will be announced soon," the specific date of the event was not revealed.
On the other hand, the event was decided in India.
Press Release on the country’s website.
It was announced that it will take place from 0 to 48 hours on August 6th.
The Prime Day has been held worldwide at the same time, but this year it may take extraordinary measures.
The big event, which sells 760 billion yen in two days, Amazon began its big sale for members in 2015 as a promotional measure for the sale of the summer field with a decrease in sales.
Initially it was a 24-hour event, but it expanded annually and last year it took place from 0:00 to 48:00 in 18 countries, including the United States, Canada, the UK, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia on July 15th.
According to the company, last year, the two-day sales rate exceeded the previous sales performance of Black Friday (the first day of the Commercial War) and Cyber Mandy (the next Monday).
This event has also contributed to the acquisition of new members of paid members “Prim”, and last year the number of applications of the first day was the largest in the past as the number of cases of one day, and the following day was the number of cases.
Last year it also sold 175 million goods worldwide.
About this, the Internet Retail magazine of the online marketing industry that the global total sales amount for two days was $7.660 million (about $760 billion) increased by 70% compared to the previous year.
Mobile number shift, excessive retention of the eye.
What about payments and points?
News from Yahoo!
The Ministry of Mobile Communications has confirmed the consideration towards the review of the same number transfer system (MNP) that can continue to use the traditional telephone number when changing mobile communications companies.
At the 21st Conference of Experts, we presented a policy to amend the MNP guidelines drawn up in 2004.
Specific arguments are widespread in the manner in which the MNP fee is paid, and in the manner in which the retention against the displaced is not.
The response from the communications companies is also expected to be linked to promoting healthy market competition.
The first user charge fee was 2000 yuan, but now it is 3,000 yuan, when the dark MNP of the communications companies was introduced.
The MNP payment income of the three major mobile communications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yuan per year.
The Ministry of General Affairs listed the current situation regarding the MNP on the site of the expert meeting “Working Group on the Verification of Competition Rules (WG)” which discusses the competitive environment of the communication market, etc.
The time of receipt for the issuance of the MNP reservation number that consumers need when moving to other communications companies was also highlighted.
The major communications companies are receiving on the web, but from the convenience of the basic system operations, the receipt time range is 9-20 hours.
In the WG document, the direction of the future consideration was clearly stated as the principle of day-to-day response.
For those who wish to move to MNP, it is also problematic to try to withhold by mobile communications companies giving points.
Excessive retention is due to the judgment that fair competition can be obstructed.
The WG member of the Nizhny Novgorod Comprehensive Institute, Nizhny Novgorod Partner, suggests that "you will have time to explain about the provision of economic profits or get permission from users, and not permitted users will be quickly issued and completed by the number.
Just in a series of arguments about the MNP fees, the structural problem is "so higher the customer becomes harder to get out, so the motivation to actively lower is difficult to work" (the Minister of General Affairs).
If an entrepreneur comes out leading down the MNP fees, there will be increased customer leaks from that company and the company’s efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has pointed out that many countries abroad do not demand user charge fees for MNP, and that is also possible in Japan.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summarizes the results of the WG as a report around October 9th and then wants to start the procedure for amending the MNP Guidelines.
If the amendment is made, the period will be 21 years later.
Mobile communications companies will be concerned, including sales and customer support.
