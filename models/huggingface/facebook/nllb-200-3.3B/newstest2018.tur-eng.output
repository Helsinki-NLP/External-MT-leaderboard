The last minute: our cosmic visitor is the giant asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, perhaps more, of giant asteroids loose in the solar system, and they can have serious consequences if they collide.
These objects, which may have closed or open orbits left over from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes pass through the Earth.
The 650-meter-wide asteroid 2014 JO25 is one such visitor and will pass 1.75 million kilometers from Earth's closest point at 14:24 today.
We hear more of this kind of news every day.
The main reason for this is the improvement in observation techniques and instruments.
This allows us to identify smaller asteroids that have not been identified before.
Last January, for example, an asteroid the size of a bus passed within only half the distance between Earth and the Moon - about a quarter of a million miles.
And even more intriguing, the asteroid was detected only days before it passed.
So there could be other cosmic buses coming at us right now.
Think about it. What would you do if you were told that an asteroid 20 meters across was going to fall right into the middle of your neighborhood?
Actually, asteroids this size won't destroy your neighborhood, but it'll probably blow out the windows of all the buildings.
That's because of the shock waves from the asteroid that's about to explode in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that hit Russia in 2013 was this big, and it shattered the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you're in the vicinity of an asteroid that's 100 meters across, I recommend you go at least 50 kilometers beyond your vicinity.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and its angle of impact determine the depth of the crater and the damage that the impact will cause.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios from the European Space Agency's simulation.
If an asteroid 100 meters in diameter were to hit the Earth at an angle of 45 degrees at 60 km per second, it would form a crater about 250 meters deep and 1,200 meters wide.
The impact is equivalent to a magnitude 6 earthquake on the Richter scale, and you'll get third-degree burns even if you're 10 kilometers away from the impact point.
The ones 50 kilometers away will be waiting for shattered windows.
If an asteroid a mile in diameter hits, it's even more disheartening.
If such an asteroid were to hit Earth at the same angle and velocity, it would form a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 kilometers in diameter.
So a whole neighborhood turns into a crater and disappears in an instant.
The heat from the impact will cause you to suffer third-degree burns even if you're 100 kilometers from the point of impact.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage of an asteroid depends not only on its chemical composition but also on the rock structure of the area it will hit.
The above values are based on the scenario of a hard rock-like asteroid falling into a region of conical rock.
If the asteroid is mostly iron, if it falls on a surface that has been cooled by lava, the crater will be three times bigger, and the resulting disaster will be twice as big.
66 million years ago, something much worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were struck by an asteroid about 10 kilometers in diameter.
The asteroid impact has killed 75% of all land and sea creatures.
If an asteroid this big that wiped out the dinosaurs is targeting Earth, the safest option is to leave the planet.
Every day, tons of material falls from space.
Most of it burns up in the atmosphere.
Some meteorites that are big enough burn up in the atmosphere, causing flashes known to the public as stellar slips.
Let's end the summer with another piece of comfort.
Studies show that a giant asteroid is not expected to hit Earth in the next 300 to 400 years, causing severe damage.
As a species that lives an average of 70 years, I'm sure you're all a little relieved.
The claim for the flash medal: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who is convinced that the Black-White team, who want to strengthen the Stoper area, will leave the name on the agenda of Inter...
The 30-year-old, who recently returned to Inter after wearing the Chilean shirt for the Confederations Cup, is looking forward to the offers that come his way.
Gazzetta dello Sport, one of the most prestigious Italian newspapers, suggested that Beşiktaş made Inter an offer of 10 million euros for Medel, who can play both in the stoper and in the forward libero zone.
It was stated that the Blacks and Whites who offered Medel the offer were waiting for a response from both sides, while the Chilean footballer was looking forward to living with his family in Istanbul.
Despite this claim of the Gazzetta, it is difficult for the Black Eagle, which has an FFP limit, to pay a price of 10 million euros for Medel.
There is a possibility of adding the star player to the squad in case the black-and-whites first move to Medel via a lease, as in the transfer of Caner Erkin, or go for a serious discount in his bonervis.
Negredo transfer was reported to the stock exchange by Beşiktaş
The human rights group issued a travel advisory for Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a travel advisory for people of color in Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racial attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The State of Missouri, through the NAACP Travel Advisory Notice effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to exercise extreme caution and care when traveling from the state's northern tip to its southern tip, as noted there, due to recent suspicious, racially motivated events occurring across the state".
The NAACP said a new Missouri law making it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, as well as the state's law enforcement's disproportionately targeting of minorities, was effective in the group's issuance of this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that people are experiencing.
They're stopped, they're beaten and they're killed because of the color of their skin", Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We're getting complaints at a rate we've never heard before".
This is the first time the association has issued a statewide warning.
The group cited the racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee, as examples.
Earlier this year, Sanders was arrested by Missouri police after running out of gas while crossing the state and was found dead in suspicious circumstances.
The advisory also highlights a new report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office that shows black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
"The advisory is for people to be alert and to warn their family, friends and coworkers about the possibility of being in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People should be prepared to bring bail money with them or to inform their relatives that they are going to be in this state".
In Missouri, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state 16th in the nation for the number of hate crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a business to sue for discrimination when renting or renting a home.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration enforcement laws that mandated local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations; the ACLU says this would increase enforcement based on race.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to this practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba is in Beşiktaş, all right.
Demba Ba, who was transferred to the Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros two seasons ago and was hired to the Black and Whites in the middle of last season, returns to Beşiktaş for free.
The Black Eagle, who asked for a detailed health report from the Senegalese player last week, took action after the report from the star footballer.
The Black and White management, who have begun work on a 32-year-old who the Chinese representative has not considered in the squad for next season, have knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not listed
Demba Ba, who was not listed because of his foreign status in China, told the administration he wanted to return to the Black and Whites.
The Chinese team has approved the 32-year-old's departure.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days and sign the official contract.
Castillo was operated on at Trabzonspor.
In a statement on the website of the Bordo-blue club, Castillo underwent arthroscopic meniscus surgery on his left knee at Istanbul Liv Hospital, stating that "Our player, after the operation carried out by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar, is expected to start training with the team in 4 weeks".
Castillo had been injured in the right back islet during the team's warm-up against the Dutch team Heerenveen in the Slovak camp.
The Colombian player, who was told that he would be away from the pitches for 3-4 weeks due to his treatment, was also decided to undergo surgery due to a meniscus problem he had previously suffered.
The referendum is coming out of Barzan!
Barzani made a speech at a commemoration ceremony in Duhok on the occasion of the 3rd anniversary of the attack by the terrorist organization Daesh on the Yazidis in Sincar district of Mosul.
In his speech, referring to the independence referendum that the ICFI wants to hold on September 25, Barzani stated: "I regret to say that we have no hope that Iraq will be a fair and orderly country".
We tried everything with Iraq, but we were completely hopeless and desperate.
Our past experiences with Iraq have brought us to this point, and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
So, together, we must show the world that we can all determine our destiny through a referendum, to ensure life and safety.
And I have to stress this: the referendum is not an end for us, but a means to achieve a greater end.
Barzani said that the Iraqi central government had made many promises to the Kurds after the fall of the Ba'ath regime in 2003, and that the direct referendum decision was taken after the fight against Daesh, noting that the disaster in Sinjar had occurred soon after.
Barzani said that the people of the ICYK want to determine their destiny in a peaceful and democratic way to protect and develop themselves, adding, "It has been shown with documents that Iraq is unable to protect us as a state or does not want to protect us".
"He doesn't want us to move forward".
Barzani noted that the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons during the fight against the terrorist organization DEAŞ, but that the Hashdi Shabi, which was established in a short time by a fatwa, was immediately banned and all weapons were provided, and reacted:
The Peshmerga, the Iraqi defense system, is not compromised.
The central government did not do to the Peshmerga what it did to Hashdi Shabi.
The Peshmerga are constitutionally recognized as part of Iraq's defense system.
But when the Hashdi Shabi had no constitutional presence, all the possibilities were mobilized, violating the laws.
We're not saying we're against Hashdi Shabi.
The Peshmerga and the Hashdi Shabi fought on the same front, so why is it that the Peshmerga's existence and the fight against terrorism are being covered up while Hashdi Shabi is being legalized?
These are our deep wounds to Baghdad.
The terrorist organization DEAŞ attacked the Yazidi population in Sincar district of Mosul on 3 August 2014 and killed many of them, including women and children.
10 minutes to go from tragedy to tragedy
According to the BBC, the Boeing 777 of Air France was west of Hokkaido in northern Japan when the North Korean missile was in the air.
The missile was recorded as falling in the area where the plane was 10 minutes ago, officials said, estimated the missile was approaching the plane at 100-150 kilometers.
Air France said the missile did not interfere with the plane's course and that there was no problem on the flight.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile fell into the sea more than 100 kilometers from the plane's course", the statement said.
Nothing is sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The clearest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans know as well as anyone the fate of this, the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003...
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key theorists, knew exactly what he was doing when he symbolically destroyed the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he did, a bunch of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would lynch him.
But he attacked its meaning, and particularly the meaning ascribed to it when, in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, Emma Lazarus' famous poem was added to the base of the monument.
Miller, as he walks up to Acosta: "I don't want to talk history from beginning to end, but the Statue of Liberty... is the symbol of American freedom shining on the world.
The poem you mentioned was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller is right about the facts, but as he says, it's not really about the history.
This is about the contemporary echo of Lazarus's chilling words, in which a state seems to invite not just some elderly immigrants but also the poorest of the poor: "The weary, the poor, / The crowded masses yearn to breathe freedom, / The wretched unwanted of the crowded darkness".
Never before has the unwanted disappeared been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not offering a literary critique; he was explaining that people didn't welcome Trump in the United States.
The conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a larger political and cultural battle: it's actually a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his friends, who campaigned to have his words placed at the base of the statue after his death, knew full well that they were engaging in a very political act.
The statue was intended to celebrate the links between French and American republicanism by symbolizing the arrival of Liberty in the form of a woman.
Lazarus changed that meaning: the female figure in his poetry was no longer abstract, there was a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Banished.
The marriage of poetry and image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigration sentiment.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right has long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, the big-talker who was a Baptist John style for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Liberty was not inviting anyone in but rather an early-stage neocon who kept the American flame burning in a darkened world: "Mrs. Liberty is coming forward.
He exists to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
"Not to light the way to the United States".
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was all about perception.
Lazarus's great creative act was to see it as seen by people on the decks of ships, exhausted, miserable but hopeful after long and often miserable voyages.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who were looking for a place to take refuge and want to improve their lives.
His statue was responding to them with words of hope and the warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, that's not a perspective that Miller and Trump would justify in any way.
Their torch is not to guide us but to turn their only source of power, their hatred, into a rage.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when only two Scotsmen made it into the Great Britain team.
Neil Black, the UK Athletics performance director, says the 16-man Scottish group in the World Championship squad will make a "huge contribution to the team".
A record-breaking number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that UK athletics should learn from it.
Black said, "We embrace it and we try to understand it and we'll fight it until we get out of the business".
"I've been talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they do.
Scottish Athletics think it's about what they do.
British athletics: He thinks it's about what they do.
So is the guy on the street around the corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely wonderful".
Many Scottish athletes are competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle has been selected by the staff as captain.
"Eilidh is a little low-key.
"The captaincy speech was incredible", says Black.
"Whether Scottish or wherever they live or train, a few athletes came out of that room very proud and truly motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally added was amazing".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will be competing in her fifth World Championships 400m hurdles, says it's "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's previous best overall world championship finish was seventh in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the middle distance runner who broke five British and two European records last year, is leading the way.
He's going to be in the 1500 and 5000.
Chris O'Hare, who ran the 1500m, had a very good season, including the British team trials and victories in the anniversary games, another Scot to watch.
Doyle remembers the first championship, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move, as many of his sisters will not only be on the team, but in some cases will be competing for medals and fighting to stay in the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that it was with the votes of the other team members, so it was already a huge honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me".
"Frankly, I'm proud of all the Scots who made the team.
That's how far we've come.
And they're here as proven athletes, as athletes looking to get on the podium.
What about the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we were very lucky in this situation, in that we have a World Championship at home.
I mean, it's really just the effect of being able to take advantage of this infield support and the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium that we're successful.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and fight, and it's going to be such a great atmosphere".
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for office if you can't handle the criticism of voters
The father of our country had some knowledge of negative press coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers began to harshly criticize him for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course he was upset by the criticism.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be abolished and we can be dumb and silent and drift ashore".
Which brings me to Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the case as frivolous, and online comments were filled with "who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook".
But this is important.
It's especially important when you're with someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state that is oppressively Democratic.
He has the second highest approval rating of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not some reactionary firecracker.
He has shown himself to be a master at leading his state and a strict adherent of principle.
He was also quite adept at using Facebook as his primary tool to connect with voters, with his jokingly hairless post-chemotherapy head.
So it's unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people from coming to the governor's page, which is a public forum, officially sanctioned and run by members of the public's taxpaying establishment.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than regulating them.
But it's very easy to use images of trolls or spammers or hateful people making verbal attacks online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a priest, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not blasphemous.
The priest shared a quote from the Bible, referring to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Maryland, wasn't hateful, but she did ask about hate crimes.
In the comment section of The Post's story, he wrote, "I delicately commented that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news".
"I also don't like the idea that when many people comment on the same issue, it's almost as if it's being ignored as a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens".
What Val's staff called "a concentrated spam attack" others will probably call "opinion peddling".
The Facebook era makes it easy to make a post agreeable by blocking an opponent or deleting a negative post.
It's much cleaner than the old days when staff were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or arrest and silence protesters.
But, digitally, that's exactly what's happening.
Hogan is not the first public servant to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked on Twitter.
One of the decisions that could be the future reference on this issue came from Virginia last week.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment when he banned a voter on Facebook, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be this hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable mail had a very similar effect to the era of the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letter writers eroded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had its unnamed trolls.
People using pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers calling Washington's decisions "underfoot".
According to the online George Washington Papers Project, which collects historical documents, the petition office was overwhelmed by criticism of his stance on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Surveillance with Britain.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and protest is at the very core of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping to make the Renaissance Club his home away from home.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty is hoping to be at home in the comfort of his home for the next three days as the Renaissance Club in South Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who had led the next gate before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, feels a sense of commitment to the new venue and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I've watched the Renaissance Club being built, and we see it rise to greatness with this organization".
The players will see the field in its best, in its most extraordinary condition.
Jerry did a great job of setting this place up.
He's a tireless advocate of this game and proud of his accomplishments here.
It's a great show for this field".
British Eales, despite winning both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour, will be fighting to retain a championship for the first time in his 32-year career.
The Southport-based player said, "It really makes you feel special".
"I hadn't had a chance to defend the Extremadura Open because the year I won was dropped from the calendar the next year.
It's good to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
It brings back memories of the past year, and for me and my wife Sharon, winning last year was very special.
It was a truly special time, one that we will always remember with affection".
Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and is now on the European Senior Tour, is making a comeback in his home turf.
This will be the first Scottish tournament since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
Orr of Helensburgh said, "It always makes a little more sense when you're struggling inside".
"You want to do the right thing, but you feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a lot of golf.
I'm happy to be going so far".
Joining the trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free entry and parking; it costs £5 per vehicle for one person and £10 for two or more.
All the profits go to Prostate Cancer UK.
I found the answer.
Imagine a "seat" with a budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish Lira, more than the budget allocated to each of the eleven ministries, including the ministries of Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science, Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism!
The number of personnel is 117,378.
It is the biggest "propaganda base" in Turkey!
Yes, the head of the Ministry of Food!
Yes, I'm going to mention the head of the Diyanet Affairs, Mehmet Görmez!
For days... I've been searching for the answer to the question in my head...
I wonder why Mehmet Görmez was removed from his seat...
I've read every article about his deployment.
There is no.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
Earlier this year...
Mehmet Görmez has prepared the Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Diyanet Affairs (DİB) for 2017-2021.
The S 600 model Mercedes worth 1 million liras was withdrawn by President Erdoğan.
So he didn't have a problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You might say, "Seven years in office isn't enough".
The first DIB President M. Rıfat Borekçi served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz, as you all know, sat in that chair for 11 years.
So... the president's term is open.
I'll ask you again why did Mehmet Görmez leave his seat?
It worked out...
Shiite affinity
A source close to the government said: "According to traditional ulema, Mehmet Dönmez has not been circumcised!"
The code for this sentence is: He didn't have a ring!
The person who uttered this sentence had this tattooed on his back: "Traditional scholar found modernist!"
I mean, Mehmet Görmez was seen as an innovator.
What was innovation?
The answer to the question was hidden in a foreign trip by Mehmet Görmez.
Date: 27 December 2015 (Authorized by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs)
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Wahdat Conference in Tehran, which aims to bring the Islamic sects closer together.
He met with the religious leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
He prayed in the ranks of the Shiite clergy.
And he said at the conference, "Sects are human schools that have been formed over time, representing different ideas and beliefs in the understanding of Islam".
All of them are for the purpose of determining the direction to Allah.
Each one is on a different path to the main road, but they all end up in the same place.
It is never acceptable to equate the cult with religion or to put sectarian affiliation above Islamic affiliation.
The division, the separation and the conflict based on the sect is a reflection of the subconscious and the ignorant.
When cults get in the way of religion, it's religion itself that gets hurt the most...
I want to underscore this again:
The Shi'ites and the Sunnis are one people.
"No one can deny another because he cannot perceive and live Islam as he understands it"...
A year later...
The 30th Unity Meeting was attended by only the Caferi leader Selahattin Özgündüz from Turkey.
I mean, I...
It's not Sunni, it's Wahhabi
Mehmet Görmez's visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him a target of "traditional elites".
This is why no one representing the Turkish state attended the next Tehran conference.
Mehmet Görmez has already been invited four times since he took office.
The reason was obvious: the Shia-Iranian anti- "traditional ulema!"
Immediately after his visit to Iran, Mehmet Görmez's chair began to wear out from the beginning of 2016.
The leader of this was the then Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş, who was in charge of the DIB!
Mehmet Görmez was so overwhelmed that he wanted to be "connected to the DIB Presidency".
The thing is...
There was a difference of opinion about Sunnihood within the state.
Some "traditional ulema" who were formed in the theoretical worlds of Saudi Arabia and Egypt identified Sunni-ism with Wahhabi-Selefilik - in the shadow of the US!
These were the anti-Iranians who couldn't even tolerate a trip to Tehran.
It was not surprising that Ahmet Cübbeli's words about Mehmet Görmez were: "Diyanet has not come to this danger".
"Lord, grant us a true and faithful leader of the nation"...
They used "uncircumcision" as a symbol of their hostility to Iran.
The anti-Iranian resistance that once was FETO, supported by the CIA, was now being led by new names.
And with the FETÖ's...
A photograph of a young man with whiskey in his hand was leaked to the media under the false name "Mehmet Görmez's son"!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who has been the biggest opponent of Mehmet Görmez in the media: Turkey! newspaper of the U.S.-led Illuminati Community.
After all...
- Who refuses to bring Sunni Islam to the Saudi Wahhabi-Selefi line...
- Who does not foment sectarian...
- Modernist... a cleric whose consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional scholar" created during the Cold War...
The US cultural imperialism is rapidly Arabising Turkey.
You have no doubt that the future head of the Ministry of Religious Affairs will be a representative of Vehhabi-Selefi!
"We support Turkey to protect its sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has left for China on an official visit.
Çavuşoğlu and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Convocation in the capital Beijing.
"We hope that Turkey will participate more actively in international affairs", Vang said.
China will support Turkey in its efforts to maintain its sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that the Palestinian issue will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey", he said.
Çavuşoğlu said that "Turkey, in its quest for close cooperation with regional and international organizations, international organizations are not alternatives but complementaries of each other".
The spiritual is officially entering his second period.
The presidency of Hasan Rouhani, who won the presidential elections in May, was confirmed by the country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Hassan Rouhani, who was elected president of Iran for the second time, was sworn in at a ceremony attended by the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Turkey's Ambassador to Tehran, Rıza Hakan Tekin, attended the ceremony, which was attended by high-ranking military and political figures as well as representatives of foreign countries.
Ruhani, who will serve as president for another four years, will officially take office after the swearing-in ceremony in parliament on Saturday, August 5.
The ceremony is expected to be attended by the Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekçi, representing Turkey.
Security measures at the Cilvegü Border Gate
No trucks carrying supplies other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning supplies will be allowed to pass through the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Hatay's Reyhanlı district.
According to the information received, the Babel Air Border Gate located near the Turkish border and the Cilvegözü Border Gate were closed to transportation except humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning materials due to adverse security conditions in the area.
The relief wagons are allowed to leave the Silvegözü Border Gate.
No information was given on how long the restriction would last.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
The Degei bartender doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
He rarely even uses a bowl.
The housewife puts a sweet potato, often known locally as "nota", directly on the fire in her wooden house in Enarotali, Paniai province, in Indonesia's restive region of Papua.
Half an hour later, the grilled meat is removed and wiped with appetite, hands unwashed.
Degei sits on a muddy floor where she does chores such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp, and has no furniture.
A bucket in a roofless house is a field helmet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, and was never assigned to any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink too much, and there are soldiers.
"No one walks in the village after 5 p.m".
A rare glimpse of daily life in the mountainous regions of Papua, a former Dutch colony that Indonesia absorbed in 1969, after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 people aged 10 and over were forced to vote by raising their hands in public before the Allied invasion.
An existing movement of independence propaganda against the Dutch government quickly directed its anger at the Jakarta government, which maintained tight control over the region, banning foreign journalists or rights watchdog organizations.
In 2003, the region was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the regional capital of Jayapura to Nabire and a five-hour car ride in a rented car with a stomach-churning stomach.
There is no public transport.
The 19,000-seat belt contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, rusted iron roofs transformed by rust into various shades of yellowish brown.
Let journalists alone, very few Indonesians have traveled here and almost no foreigners have traveled here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We are not used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, referring to her brightly colored, hand-woven wrap, dark shirt, and glittering skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies".
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, with 28 percent of the population living below the poverty line and the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also the gold of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous area the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined approximately $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
Yet, for the Papuans, it is this wealth, a source of misery, that keeps Indonesia's powerful military a stranglehold.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reports that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in bribes to a single officer.
The call for greater autonomy from the Papuans threatens this golden egg-laying hen and ruthlessly tramples on its rights.
According to rights activists, since 1969 more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian army, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
The mass killings in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
The Brisbane Archdiocese's 2016 "We Will Lose Everything" report includes testimony from the previous year, including extrajudicial executions, torture (where rape and electrocution are particularly popular according to another report) and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because there are incidents every week", says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
Pressures were heightened as Papua's resources brought settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The region's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive for economic purposes.
Javalí warung buffet sells gado-gado, which is served with peanut sauce mixed with fried chicken and vegetables.
The locals are struggling to compete.
"The migrants sell chicken and vegetables at cheaper prices than the local Papuans in the traditional markets", explains Abeth You, 24, a native of Paniai who moved to the regional capital Jayapura for work.
"This has caused the local Papuans, the Papuan mama-mas (women) to lose the market".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua.
The former carpenter, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, took the vote of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panaia.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he would fulfill our hope that justice would be restored", You said.
In fact, Paniai experienced its worst just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas songs outside a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles tore through the dark.
The frightened children told them they had to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers resented their manner, and according to local priest Yavedt Tebai, he later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said that the soldiers, who were drunk, chased the group and beat them with the butt of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the group of children.
One of the boys, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he lapsed into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the next day, the violence escalated.
About 1,000 Papuans, men, women and children, gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried traditional hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (running in a circle and mimicking the song of birds).
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military garrison.
As the nerves grew more tense, orders were sent over the internal radio to the soldiers: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them dead". An official document seen by TIME, but not disclosed to local media, said:
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the approaching danger and urged the crowd to return home and appeal for calm.
No one was going to listen.
"I turned around and was hit by a bullet in my left wrist", he told TIME on the front porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired it, but he says the bullet came from a military era.
"It was crowded, there was a lot of shooting", he adds.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, local resident Alfius Youw was shot three times.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", he told TIME, gloomily.
"I saw her die... and I kissed her".
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers had only "taken the station to safety" because the station was under attack.
Papua police spokesman Branch Manager Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015: "When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves".
"This is a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi made a stirring speech three weeks later in Jayapura, expressing sympathy with the victims' families and promising to resolve historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case solved immediately so that it doesn't happen again".
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that a non-judicial mechanism had been established for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the attacks were long ago.
Some in the '90s, some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these violations, but there are processes that we have to go through".
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto backtracked, saying there was no plan to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It's all going to be solved by law".
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "crimes against humanity" involving more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been solved.
The families of the Paniai victims have met such claims with bitter skepticism.
"I have been admitted to four appointments in the past three years, but no progress has been made", says Johannes.
"I was tired".
Years later, he says he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot".
His brother Yacobus reiterates the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the matter.
He says he was beaten by the soldier after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the soldier came looking for me".
The attacks have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in Deiyai district, Paniai's neighbour.
During the clash between the villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help take a man to the hospital who was unconscious, one person died and 17 people were injured, including children.
Ravianus Douw, 24, drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's construction office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
"We were very panicked, afraid of revenge", Dominggu Badii, 29, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the treatment of the wounded, told TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days".
The parliament of Deiyai called for the officials involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples who live scattered across Papua's green highland heartland.
Many joined the rebel army, the Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the rights of Papuans by carrying out random attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, are from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years under the pretext of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some of them never see each other again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the Indians to buy.
Bread is unattainable.
The people here grow everything they eat: mainly the note, but also some fruits and vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can support themselves with four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and sell the rest at the local market.
10 of them are only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities grew between the indigenous Papuans and the new immigrants who arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
And the jobs that are scarce usually go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
The Papuans rarely have the capital or the skills to run their businesses competitively.
John Gobai, chairman of the Panai tribal council, says, "Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here".
Tecrit is keeping the world's eyes off of Papua.
Moreover, the journalistic restrictions for international media remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with relevant agencies", despite being granted a rare video permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting and development to increase transparency have not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said: "Foreign journalists trying to cover the troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting".
The lack of press censorship means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir ignored the group's claims, telling journalists in Jakarta that "the democratic system is still in place in Indonesia and there is a free media so it is difficult to cover up evidence in human rights cases".
The local people want more foreign government to be involved.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want to be named, the local people broke the silence with pleas of "We want freedom".
Indonesia has one more presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say it's unlikely they'll vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person of good intentions, but surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai attack", says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that, apart from living under the looming threat of a tyrannical soldier, they are wallowing in poverty with meager education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their votes as a "loan" to Jokowi to pay him back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice".
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack have taken a last symbolic act of defiance: burying the body of a victim in a field directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice can never be served, they will at least ensure that those responsible do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed", Yacobus says, his head bowed.
"What else can we do?"
The fire has engulfed Dubai's 'Meshal' skyscraper for the second time.
In Dubai, a fire on Friday gutted the world's tallest residential towers, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter, 79-story building.
This is the second major fire in two years that has quickly spread to a tall building called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was given as to the cause of the large fire.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get to the 50th floor", a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said fire crews extinguished the large fire at around 4 am local time (00:00 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government has stated that they are trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident could re-raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of tall buildings around the world.
The Torch Authority's investigation following the 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, the outer panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the insulation and coating panel system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June.
The gospel of 'social help' to more than 4 thousand chronic patients
The Ministry of Family and Social Policies will launch a social assistance program for poor citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases, and 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit in the first phase.
The Ministry plans to provide monthly support to patients above two thirds of the minimum wage with its aid program, and will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information, the details and implementation principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases" that started to work a while ago with the instruction of the Minister of Family and Social Policies Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya have become known.
The social assistance program, which was launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health to support citizens who are struggling with chronic diseases and who are experiencing economic and psychological difficulties, is also the first in the world in many respects.
The Ministry, which has completed all the preparations necessary for the launch of the program, will provide families with regular psychosocial support through the social assistance program, not only cash.
This is to ensure that poor citizens and their families who have chronic illnesses and continue their treatment processes at home are not left alone, both materially and spiritually.
According to the studies, in the first stage, poor citizens who are struggling with SubAcute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and the measles germ, will be provided with regular psychosocial and cash support under the new social assistance program.
And in the later stages of the program, it will be extended to help poor citizens who are struggling with other rare and life-threatening diseases.
In addition to the support, which is planned to be paid at a rate of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments may be made to tuberculosis patients who cannot afford medical care, are bed-dependent or whose home living conditions need to be improved.
To be eligible for the allowance, the household must have a per capita monthly income of less than two thirds of the net monthly minimum wage.
Also, citizens with SSPE must have a health board report prepared according to the procedures and principles specified in the "Regulation on the Measurement, Classification and Health Board Reports for Disabled Persons".
More than 1 in 5 U.S. passengers carrying banned substances on board, according to a survey.
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled banned substances onto the plane from US Transportation Security Agency checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who unknowingly carried banned knives or other sharp objects.
Less than 1 percent claimed to have later realized they had accidentally traveled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
A study of more than 1,000 people conducted by the jet charter service Stratos Jet Charters also found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Among the participants who admitted to knowingly attempting to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were from Generation Y, while less than 15 percent were from Generation X.
The most common items purposely smuggled out of TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying sharp tools from security, while 2.2 percent of female participants and 3.7 percent of male participants admitted to knowingly carrying prohibited drugs on the plane.
The firm said that airport security is surveying passengers nationwide to find out how many people accidentally brought in contraband and how many did it knowingly.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to smuggle security, knowingly or unknowingly, are the ones who fly the most.
However, as the firm has pointed out, the TSA rules are a bit tricky and confusing.
People often aren't sure what fluids or how much fluid they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of substance seized by the TSA turned out to be a banned liquid.
For a while, people thought that the TSA might be treating the books as contraband.
Fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but not international ones.
China welcomed the US's comments
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a press conference in Beijing that they were not looking for excuses to send our troops north of the 38th parallel, and that they were looking for regime change, regime collapse, rapid reunification of the peninsula, and they were not looking for excuses to send our troops north of the 38th parallel.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang said that Tillerson reiterated the Washington administration's principles on the North Korean issue and hoped that the US would implement these principles effectively and in a concrete result-oriented policy.
Wang stressed that the security of the Korean peninsula is a priority and that the parties should find a middle way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has always insisted on the denuclearization of the peninsula, the preservation of peace and stability, and the resolution of problems through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA Chairman Pruitt has refused to delay the Obama-era emissions cuts.
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Chairman Scott Pruitt has backed away from the Obama-era law that reduced emissions of dirty fumes.
Pruitt represented change in that his organization was more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than past administrations.
He never mentioned the legal challenge to his previous position in a federal high court.
The states in question are beginning to meet the 2015 ground-level ozone standards by October 1, the end of the period.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his organization more time to work on the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth".
Pruitt, who was the state attorney general of Oklahoma before being appointed by President Donald Trump, had long served as a trusted ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday's sudden change is the latest legal defeat for Pruitt's agenda to reverse the arrangement.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had overstepped his authority to try to delay an Obama administration law requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that the backsliding in ozone standards only strengthened the EPA's commitment to working with states to meet the new standards on time and through complex processes.
Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous work, said, "Under previous administrations, the EPA frequently failed to meet deadlines for rulings, waited to be sued by activist groups and others, and agreed to settle disputes to set timelines for rulings".
"We don't believe in settling by litigation, and we take due dates seriously.
We also take the law and its authority seriously".
However, the EPA's statement stated that Pruitt may at some point once again exercise "the power of deferral and all other powers legally available" to ensure that regulations are "supported by sound policies and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone laws.
A House bill passed last month seeks to delay the implementation of 2015 laws by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The EPA's reversal of its decision following our lawsuits is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the filthy smoke that is pouring into their communities".
The lawsuit was filed in New York by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is produced when common pollutants are released by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources that react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting foul smoke can cause severe respiratory problems in a vulnerable group of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists have applauded Pruitt's surprise reversal.
Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity said: "It is disturbing that it takes so much pressure to get this sensible step from someone who is responsible for protecting the air we breathe".
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological battle to pander to environmental polluters and interest groups".
Inflation is in the single digits.
Turkey, which recorded the largest increase in exports in 6 years in July, unemployment rate of 13.0 percent in January, and economic confidence index rose to a peak of 3.5 years, Turkey, inflation also fell to a single digit.
According to the data released by the Turkish Statistics Agency (TÜİK) yesterday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.15 percent in the quarter, while the annual inflation fell to 9.79 percent for the first time since the mine.
In terms of the main spending groups in July, the highest increase on a monthly basis was seen in the restaurants and hotels group with 1.75 percent, while the group that showed the greatest decrease was clothing and footwear with 3.51 percent.
The highest year-on-year increase was in the transportation group, at 15.24%.
Noting that inflation was falling to one household in July, parallel to expectations, Business Investment Economist Muammer Kömürcüoğlu said, "The moderate trend in inflation is influenced by the decline in prices of food and clothing groups".
But the headlines are up against the core indicators from the previous month.
"We don't expect a relaxation in the Central Bank's tough stance", he said.
The core inflation indicators have risen, while the headline inflation has declined.
The B index, which is closely monitored by the Central Bank, rose from 9.07 percent to 9.46 percent in July, while the C index rose from 9.20 percent to 9.60 percent.
Enver Erkan, Deputy Director of Research at Kapital FX, stated that inflation could be closed from the 9.3 percent level for the year, "Inflation could fluctuate until December and fall to one digit in December".
"The Central Bank may have an opportunity in the first months of 2018", he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek: Inflation will close the year-end with one building.
The Fed's tightening will continue until inflation falls below 7 percent.
We'll finalize the reforms at the nearby Food Committee.
Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci: We are happy that inflation has fallen to single digits, but it needs to become permanent.
In order to combat inflation, we need to reduce the volatility of food prices and increase supply.
Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan: In the coming months, there may be some upward trend in annual inflation due to the base effect, but the decline in inflation will be noticeable from the first months of 2018.
We expect annual inflation to fall even further.
I wish Fenerbahce the best in the next matches.
Sturm Graz technical director Franco Foda said that their second-half performance in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round match against Fenerbahce, where they were 1-1 was not enough to get through the round.
Foda, who spoke at a press conference after the match, said Fenerbahçe were a top-level team, "We couldn't use the wings in the first half".
We got the game tied in the second half.
We got a shot at the second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
They changed the flow of the game in the second half.
We could have been a little better.
It was the little things that made the difference in the game.
"I wish Fenerbahce success in their next matches".
Foda said that they felt very good during their stay in Turkey and were happy with the hospitality they received.
Fernando is in Istanbul.
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who started the transfer negotiations for Galatasaray Club, arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer arrived at Atatürk Airport and was enthusiastically welcomed by the fans.
Fernando, who was cheered by fans in yellow and red, left the airport by boarding a special vehicle that was waiting for him under security measures.
Fernando, 30, who started his career with Brazil's Vila Nova, plays in midfield, wearing the Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City uniforms.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign with the yellow and red team after passing the medical check.
Galatasaray, which is still in the process of transferring players, has secured a deal with Manchester City for 5 million 250 thousand euros for Fernando, who they have been trying to add to their squad for a long time.
The flash Rakka move from the USA: The Internal Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who was connected to the Pentagon via videoconference from Baghdad, said that the Rakka Internal Security Force (RIGF) trained by the coalition had begun to settle in the areas of the city that had been cleared of DEAŞ.
"The Rakka Internal Security Force, which is made up of mostly Arabs and local anti-ISIS volunteers in the cleared areas of the city, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from fleeing or returning", Dillon said.
Dillon said that 230 more people have joined the group this week, adding that "the number of forces in question is now 850".
Dillon stated that the group was given basic weapons training by the coalition, as well as training in first aid, armed conflict, reconnaissance and checkpoint operations.
Dillon noted that the interest in the Rakka Internal Security Force is very intense, and noted that the coalition will continue to screen applicants for training and employment.
The US-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which forms the main backbone of the PYD/PKK in the takeover of Raqqa.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization had appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammed as co-chair of the Raqqa civilian administration council.
It is alleged that there will be PKK/PYD members in the military force in Raqqa.
Dillon also announced that the US-led coalition had cut its support last week and was collecting heavy weapons from the opposition group Shuhada Karyateyn (Shouk) in the El Tanif camp in southern Syria.
"After meeting with the leaders last week, Shukuk took back the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition gave them, but some small arms and light vehicles were allowed to remain with them", Dillon said.
The US announced last week that it was withdrawing support from Shukuk, who was out patrolling outside the de-escalation zones agreed with Russia, and was engaged in activities unrelated to the fight against Daesh.
It is stated that the group wants to fight against the regime of Bashar Assad as well as against the "DEAŞ".
According to leaked phone records, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
Notes of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump squeezed him for not publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States has rebuked the president of Mexico for holding the ball in public against the wall, and has reportedly said, "You can't tell that to the press".
Trump began his presidential campaign by building a wall along the southern border of the United States, promising to pay Mexico for the project.
The notes of his first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released as a heated dialogue was revealed.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the US deal to take refugees to Australia was "ridiculous", "rotten" and "silly", and that the Obama administration's deal, after proposing to ban a refugee from entering the US, would make him look "stupid".
Mr. Trump ended his speech by telling Mr. Turnbull, "That was the most disgusting speech I've ever made all day".
The patient's relatives broke the doctor's nose
Doctors and employees of the Turkish Higher Specialized Training and Research Hospital left their jobs yesterday morning in response to the beating of a doctor colleague by his relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital reacted to the incident with signs saying "No to violence in health".
The head of the hospital's pediatric cardiology clinic, Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Paç, said, ""The slogan 'no to violence in healthcare' seems to me to be inadequate and even a slogan of the side".
In health, violence has no place.
"If this goes on, this people will soon be faced with a health group that will not be able to serve them", he said.
The action of the health workers was supported by the Director of Health of Ankara Dr. Kamil Turkmen, the General Secretary of Public Hospitals of Ankara First Region Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, the Chief Physician of Turkey Higher Specialized Education and Research Hospital Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and the patients' relatives in the hospital yard.
Paç condemned the incident and said:
Unfortunately, violence against health care workers is on the rise.
We had an example of this yesterday evening when our cardiovascular surgeon was beaten by a patient's relative.
Although we are taking all possible measures as a state, ministry and governorate to end these events as soon as possible, we also demand that our people increase their sensitivity in this matter.
I condemn the events of yesterday on behalf of my hospital and my health care staff.
Odabaş, who pointed out that society needs to be aware of violence in health, said, "Unfortunately, the times we live in have become a professional complication".
"We will take our own measures, but the most important thing is that our nation has its own health worker".
Turkmen also stated that the judicial process has started regarding the incident, "Our laws on violence in healthcare have been effective enough".
The state's enforcing it.
The police are doing a security study.
In the past, they've been idle, but now it's a direct public case, and the state's attorney's assigned it, and he's pursuing it.
"There are examples of severe punishments that have been given in this regard", he said.
After the explanations, the employees continued their work.
The incident allegedly occurred at approximately 5:45 p.m. the previous day.
The relatives of the patient who died in intensive care attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Özbek, who worked in the department of cardiothoracic surgery, who reported the death.
While Uzbek was being removed from the scene by the doctor and assistants, the police were called to the hospital.
The attackers were taken into custody while Uzbek's nose was broken.
A doctor who witnessed the incident said:
When our friend went to the relatives of a patient who had died to inform them of the situation, they blamed us and our friend for the situation and attacked two of our friends.
Our friend's nose is broken, covered in blood.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid him.
For 15 or 20 minutes, security pulled a switch.
If the patient's loved ones had broken through that security fence, things would have been a lot worse.

The YPG raids in Syria are...
The U.S. intervened
According to information obtained by AA from local sources, YPG terrorists looted the homes of Tel Semin residents in the northern countryside of Raqqa, where the US military had entered under the pretext of fighting the terrorist organization DEAŞ.
The reaction of the civilians whose houses were looted and confiscated, turned into a clash with the terrorist organization.
U.S. forces in the area then entered the city in armoured vehicles.
Cougar MRAP armored personnel carriers and Husky mine detection vehicles were seen creating a buffer zone in the town.
The YPG terrorist group is not allowing civilians fleeing death in Raqqa, which was under fire during the anti-ISIS operation, to enter the cities under its control.
Local activist network "Rakka is being silently massacred" announced yesterday that 121 civilians were killed by the artillery of the organization in July alone.
Let's not put off the old world's quarrels
Delayed perception of domestic and global realities can lead to crisis not only for individuals but also for countries.
One of the reasons why the backward East, which we call "Africanism", perceives the world's realities late is that the reflection of these realities on the geography of the East is blocked by certain focal points or is announced in a way that is counter-real.
The late perception or not perception of change has been the subject of literary world as well.
Cervantes' Don Quixote is a meczup who, at the time the bourgeoisie was just beginning to form, still thought himself a knight.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is a lazy heritage that thinks that when it ignores the facts, everything can go on as usual.
China, for example, was a country that was open to the world and dominated the seas until the end of the 15th century, when a conservative dynasty came to power.
It lasted until the captains of ships that sailed out of Chinese territorial waters were executed.
We Turks, who have one foot, eyes and ears in the West and the other foot, eyes and ears in the East, have been in constant dilemmas about perceiving the truth and change since the Ottoman Empire.
We tried to bring yesterday into the present, to understand today in terms of old conditions, to imagine yesterday into the future.
And a part of us was able to move as quickly as the thinking minds in the developed world in terms of perceiving the realities of the country and the world, and in terms of perceiving change.
This has led to constant conflict and tension.
The madrassa and the university, the novelty and the modern army, the encounters of faith and doubt, have given rise to a dualism of dramatic content.
Progressivism is obsolete. Worse, it was not accepted that the positions that were new and advanced at one time would become obsolete and be left behind at a certain time.
The forerunners of yesterday, after a period, began to declare the new and advanced "Dangerous", and those who tried to interpret the conditions of the homeland and the world in accordance with the current reality, "Treason".
The most important lesson in the Ottoman Empire is that those who perceive the realities of the country and the world late become the master of thought and state life, eventually the empire disintegrated, collapsed and the people became impoverished.
The most important lesson that our Ottoman past taught the Republic was that the world's economic situation and the ability to quickly perceive change were an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
And because this lesson was so well learned, we were able to be the model country of this geography that has managed to preserve its unity, integrity, stability in peace since World War I until today.
A different approach to the global change we're going through, and to survive, we need to let go of the memories and act in accordance with the realities.
In other words, it will not do anyone any good to carry on the senseless camping and blood feuds that have caused stagnation in our democracy in the past.
And in today's world, the smallest mistakes lead to the biggest and most dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography in this regard is the Middle East, which is where we are.

Turkish wind
Global giants, who trust in Turkey's future, fought to the death in the wind power plant auction that took place yesterday.
The procurement of the model that the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has set up to reduce foreign dependency and provide for the transition to national energy broke the world record.
With the tender that will bring down Turkey's energy costs, an investment of 1 billion dollars and the creation of close to 4 thousand jobs have been opened.
By 2019, domestically produced wind turbines will be incorporated into the system.
The renewable energy resource areas (YEKA) wind power plant license tender, opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, was attended by 8 consortiums, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants.
In the bidding process, the financial bid envelopes were opened in order to identify the 5 bidders who made the lowest bid in the bidding process.
After the first envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19/kWh.
The open reduction range was set at 0.01 cents.
After the start of the tender, the joint venture groups, which include Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas, decided not to participate in the open tender.
The open elimination was contested by teams from Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang.
Nordex withdrew from the consortium, leaving MingYang-I Construction and Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon in the last two.
MingYang-I Construction has been on break 11 times.
The Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon Energy consortium has never had a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: It is a record day for Turkey.
The open cut continued for 30 laps.
The winner of the intense competition between the two consortia was the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which offered the lowest bid at $ 3.48 cents/kWh.
The consortium offered 3.49 cents per kilowatt hour, but at the request of the tendering commission headed by Deputy Secretary Alparslan Bayraktar, the consortium reduced the offer to 3.48 cents.
Turkey set a world record with the result of the YEKA auction, which lasted two hours.
The bidding for $3.48 per kilowatt hour is the lowest in the world in this field.
The previous record was held by Mexico at $3.84 per kilowatt hour.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak, who held a press conference after the conclusion of the tender, said that the German company Siemens's victory in the competition was an important message to the region and the world, "I think that this result will make an important contribution to Turkey-Germany relations, considering the 200-year-old historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany".
Our goals are big.
The results that emerged today have shown how solid and confident the economy and energy market is going to be in the future.
I am very proud to say that despite the regional crises in the world, Turkey is the most reliable country in the region and the world for investment.
"All of Turkey, 80 million of us, will be proud of this picture, the biggest contribution is our President who has brought Turkey to this point in 15 years of power and leadership", he said.
Albayrak said that they started a new era with the bidding, where there was open, transparent and competitive competition, and said: "One of the most important steps of this was that the purchase cost of 10.3 dollars/cent per kilowatt hour with the local contribution in wind until yesterday, fell to a historical record of 3.48 dollars/cent, with a world record price".
I'm proud of that, for my people, for my country.
Minister Albayrak said that they aim to commission the first domestically produced solar panels before the end of 2018, and said, "Hopefully, by the beginning of 2019, we will include our domestically produced wind turbines in the system".
The turbines will be installed in five designated areas.
The winning company will receive a total of 1,000 megawatts of installed wind power, with the condition of installing at least 50 megawatts of wind power in each of these five regions.
The Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon group will have a combined investment of over $1 billion.
With the commissioning of the indigenous wind farms, at least 3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity will be generated each year and approximately 1.1 million homes will be supplied with electricity from the wind.
The wind farms will also reduce the average annual CO2 emissions by 1.5 million tons.
The winning company will invest over 100 million dollars in the plant.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 indigenous wind turbines, with a capacity of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will do R&D in a total of 5 areas over 10 years in at least three of the areas of wing, generator design, material technologies and manufacturing techniques, software and innovative gearbox.
With an annual budget of $5 million for R&D, it will be staffed by 50 technicians, 80% of whom are local engineers.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project is licensed for 30 years.
Kazım Türker, the CEO of Türkler İnşaat, which is part of the consortium that won the tender, said that the project will have around 64 percent of domestic production, with 35 percent of the equipment coming from abroad, "We plan to provide the financing of the equipment from foreign sources, and the rest from domestic banks".
Türker stated that the tender reflected the trust in the Turkish economy.
Murtaza Ata, the chairman of Kalyon Holding Enerji Group, said: "It was a bid that would reduce Turkey's dependence on foreign energy by a thousand megawatts".
"We are pleased with the outcome", he said.
SIemens Gamesa Turkey's Senior Manager Hakan Yıldırım also said that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years and that "We will do our best to reduce the cost of electricity unit".
The wind turbines to be manufactured at the factory will have a minimum indigenous rating of 65 percent.
65 percent of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine will be local (at least 5,200 pieces).
At least 50 MW of installed capacity, totalling 1000 MW, will be installed in each of the five zones.
The opportunity to employ 3,750 people. 10 years of R&amp;D. The obligation to spend $5 million on R&amp;D.
1,000MW Wind Plant 65% Localization Production of 300 to 450 indigenous wind turbines with a capacity of at least 2.3 MWe.

Moore's Ford massacre: Activists call for justice as racist lynch mobs revive the case
A 1948 Ford Mercury was driven through a crowd of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and slammed into the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car with four black passengers and a white driver was blocked by a group of armed white men before it reached the bridge.
The gang leader, a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit, took a long breath from his cigar and looked carefully in through the windshield.
Inside, the people were shaking in fear.
"We want that, Roger!" he barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat, screaming through the darkness.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which was played on June 22, is only a reenactment.
But when a noose was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience gave a very realistic sigh.
Since 2005, human rights advocates have returned to the Ford Bridge in Moore to reenact the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George Mae and Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one's been charged with the murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: "It's inconceivable that we see them in our communities, that we know who they are, but not one person has been arrested in all these years".
"This is a stain on history, but a burden on our souls".
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong advocate for human rights.
For him, this revival is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community of an injustice that has never been righted.
He said, "We want litigation, we want results, we want wound healing, we want a settlement, but we have to get justice first".
"We cannot have healing and reconciliation until we have justice".
The coroner puts a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Ford lynching at Moore on July 27, 1946.
FBI files obtained by NBC News show that more than 50 men in Monroe and the surrounding area were suspected of lynching.
But one of them was never investigated.
Although the suspects remained fugitives for decades, human rights activists say the twin motivations of lynchings have always been well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in a primary election later that summer.
According to the FBI, around the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight over what appeared to be a woman.
Brooks testified that the word in town was that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey, went to prison with her.
But as they drove away from the prison, they came to the Ford Bridge in Moore, and a lynching mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes that "it appears that Harrison arranged and ordered the murders".
"It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and local law enforcement, "who not only participated in the murder, "but destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks was shorter and more concise.
He said, "This was a voting rights massacre".
"All of them were killed to send a message to the black people in this community: 'If you register and vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual revival of the Ford Bridge lynchers at Moore.
His performance is eye-popping, remarkable, and based on a deep-seated kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to follow, and even harder to turn your eyes away, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lynching because it exposes us all to the ugliness inside of us".
"But if you don't listen to me or what's happening to me, I can't have a relationship with you".
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) packed into a room and listened as Greene eagerly delved into the well-rehearsed outlines of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as Greene's assistant director.
For years, he played the role of President Klansman, but he says the role never gets easy.
Marbaugh said, "I feel violated because that's not me".
"But I think it's important to keep that past alive because we don't want to go back to that time".
Across the room, the actors who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, were rehearsing their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm shouting at Hester and pushing her, furious that he's slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"Z...i said get off my property!"
He's reacting to the Rascona.
There's a knock.
And then everybody (at least the black actors) drowns in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona said, "What?"
He was nervous, he was surprised.
Was I too hard?
Greene said, "No", with a chuckle.
"I just don't think white people were saying that at the time".
One of the black players said, "Yes", and he threw a joke.
"You have to press the 'R.'"
So the energy in the room changes, and a kind of intimacy replaces the restlessness.
Everyone is committed to doing this right, not just for the sake of the game but also in memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene begins again.
This time Rascona says the N word, sharp and emphatic.
No one is laughing at all.
The reanimation ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and reads Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy "Strange Fruit".
It's broken in both words.
A hundred yards back, a crowd of about four dozen spectators wiping their sweat and tears.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many from further up the road.
They all endured the oppressive humidity of Georgia for nearly eight hours while Brooks took them on a sacred journey to the burial grounds of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up until now, the murders were just an anecdote, but now, standing in the same spot as the lynching means the weather is cursed.
As the song's final notes fade, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and examine their bodies.
The children are lying on their hands, clutching fake blood and immobile bodies and whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead", he mutters, as if a little child is reminding him.
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and then it's over.
Actors throwing the lynchpin and wiping their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh in the suit that plays the president of the Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugging two of his co-stars and tears streaming down their arms, the emotional toll of the performance finally coming to him.
One of the women whispers, "It's okay".
"We know that this is not what is in your heart.
You did it for a reason".
Then the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
A white couple from Atlanta is sitting at a table, having a heated conversation with a black couple about reanimation.
Denise Duplinski has a hard time finding the words to describe how the performance makes her feel.
He said, "These horrible, horrible things that you hear and do... they come from people who are like you, and they do it because they're like you".
"What this does to me is that it makes me think that the lynchings are still going on", he added, "and that they're just called police shootings".
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is having dinner at his table, and everyone's paying attention to him as he recalls his human rights record.
He said he's already planning for next year's performance.
He said, "Revival is inspiring in a way because it describes what we've been through, but it's also instructive".
"As if, if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not investigate their own past, those who do not know their past, are doomed to repeat it".

AK Party website dedicated to the congress
By the AK Party, 6.
A website "akkongreler.com" was created for the regular congress process.
The website has a list of brochures, materials and images that the party organization will use during this process.
In the 'Communication strategy' section of the site, the rules to be followed during the congress process are listed in 14 headings.
The President and the AK Party General Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose message was published on the website, warned the members of the organization to follow the party's corporate identity during the congress.
In his message, Erdoğan said, "Now we are starting a new era of progress".
We must renew and refresh ourselves to achieve our 2023 goals with more robust steps.
"We must continue to work hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, as we did yesterday", he said.
Pearson made 3,000 more layoffs, cutting his profit share, to revive the business.
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would make another 3,000 layoffs and cut its dividend by 72 percent as it embarks on another restructuring program to overcome the pressures facing business.
Chief executive John Fallon said the layoffs, most of which will occur in late 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan in May to save a further £300 million ($394 million) by trying to revive the fast-moving business to digital learning with a third cost-cutting programme.
The firm, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for this year was unchanged after reporting core sales in the first half of the year up 1 percent to £2.05 billion.
Metin 2 has led to death again!
According to the initial report of the Medical Examiner, the preliminary autopsy report of Hakan's death is a suicide.
A thorough examination of the boy's body revealed no signs of trauma or abrasions.
The cause of death was asphyxiation due to the tightening of the elastic bandage around his neck.
It turns out that the gland that her family described as a tendon is actually an elastic bandage used on wounds.
According to the report of Muslim Saryar from Gazete Habertürk, after the preparation of a detailed report on the death of the child, it was learned that the report stating that the incident was a suicide would be sent to the Büyükçekmece Republic Prosecutor's Office, which is conducting the investigation.
Police are investigating the boy's suicide in all its details, as they are continuing to examine the computer that was seized after the incident.
It was stated that the police will also take the testimony of Hakan's friends.
It is also stated that information obtained from the computer of Hakan, who was "cleaned" by his relatives, could be accessed by third parties or a gang.
Police are considering that Hakan may have been driven to suicide by a gang.
The certainty that Hakan had committed suicide turned the eyes into violent Metin2.
Metin2, which was banned last year by the Antalya Governorate for children under 15, was brought to the fore in 2009 with the murder of the 13-year-old "mini hacker" Metin Kang.
To play "Designed in Korea in 2005", you need to log in and sign up.
Players use the dragon god in the game to bring peace and justice to the world.
And in doing so, there are wars, there's violence.
The game includes images of warfare with weapons such as swords, axes, and pickaxes, as well as images of people being torn to pieces by wild animals.
The player buys characters with money to gain power.
The family that buried their children the next day after the incident in the house on Köknar Street in Esenyurt İstiklal Mahallesi, continued the murder allegation.
Father Mehmet Ekinci said, "It was all about being a fantasy doctor, we don't think he could harm himself or anyone else because of the game", while he said: "They wrapped an elastic bandage around his neck and tied a knot on the side".
He was found that way, son.
We certainly don't think our son is capable of harming himself or anyone else or committing suicide because of an online game.
We knew you were playing this game.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's just say he got a little bored and dropped out of the game.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci is "No one entering or leaving the building".
It's said that my child entered the house at a certain time.
None of them hold together.
When her brother came home, there was only one chair.
"But when the body was found, there were two chairs next to the computer", he said.
İlker KARAŞ: He may have been infected by the gang
Families generally don't pay attention to this.
They're like, "Whether my kid's home or whatever".
A child interacts with many people through games.
There may have been a loan-sharking or a swear-outs.
Or he invited a character from the play into the house, and there was a problem.
It could be that he's been affected by problems with other people he's interacted with through the game, not directly from the game.
The visuals, the plot, the kid could have taken it for real.
The trauma that led to the suicide could be blackmail related.
If the child faces the possibility of complaints from the family, then there is also the possibility of depression because he cannot solve the problem.
He couldn't have killed himself because of the game itself.
There's a chance the kid could be involved in a gang.
He could be involved with the gang.
There's nothing that the individual child could have done on his own.
Füsun NEBİL, IT consultant: Families should know about their children's interaction
We can't say that games are harmful.
And research has shown that games are good for children's development.
The key here is that parents pay attention to what their children are playing and how they talk to players online.
Parents need to know what content is affecting their children and how to take precautions.
In Turkey, there are only two children in the five years that are said to have died because of gambling.
It just goes to show that it's not just games that end a child's life.
What could have caused this child to do this?
We have to find out first.
You need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
The 8-month yield on the Borsa Istanbul stood at 50 percent
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend that started in December 2016 in July, moving its rise to the top for the 8th month.
The index thus gained 45.3 percent for the first time since July 2007, when it had increased for eight consecutive months.
The BIST 100 index, which has outperformed the world's major stock exchanges, including Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, with its performance since the beginning of the year, did not lose its leadership in July in terms of yield.
The BIST 100 index, which completed July with a 7.06 percent increase, was followed by the Dow Jones index in the United States with a 2.54 percent increase, and the FTSE 100 index in the United Kingdom with a 0.81 percent increase.
The DAX in Germany and the Nikkei in Japan both ended July with losses.
The BIST 100 index was found to have performed better than both the major world stock exchanges and the emerging market stock market indices for the period January-July.
The BIST 100 index gained 37.6 percent by the end of 2016, followed by Dow Jones with a 10.76 percent increase, DAX index with a 5.55 percent increase, Nikkei index with a 4.55 percent increase, FTSE 100 index with a 3.21 percent increase.
The MSCI EM index, which is a benchmark for emerging market stocks, returned 23 percent.
The BIST 100 index has shown similar performance in the past, looking at the historical process.
The BIST 100 index, which last gained eight months in a row between December 2006 and July 2007, had a 38.3 percent increase during that period.
The BIST 100 index also completed 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997, 9 months in a row between May 1997 and January 1998.
Eren Can Ümüt, Director of Research at Meksa Yatırım, told the AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, noting that since the beginning of the year, the rise has exceeded the 37 percent level.
Umut noted that the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) index has recorded a 23 percent rise, noting that even looking at these rates, there is a positive divergence:
The flow of funds to developing countries has been continuous since the beginning of the year.
Especially high-yield funds prefer countries with higher interest rates.
This is affecting domestic markets in a positive way.
Of course, on a global scale, the risk appetite is also quite high.
That's why the risk-asset-status stock index is so popular.
In the U.S., we see new record levels being tested almost every week, in parallel to the S&amp;P 500 index having risen by nearly 11 percent since the beginning of the year.
He said that the US central bank (Fed) 3 percent rate hike at the beginning of the year was stressing the forecast markets, but that the Fed was using its verbal guidance policy to eliminate the uncertainty, and noted that the market was insensitive to the Fed's rate hike.
He said that the expectations that inflation in the US is not yet at the desired level, that the Fed will not rush to raise interest rates and avoid radical moves are also very effective in current pricing.
"Although the US economy, which grew faster thanks to Trump, had a positive impact on stock markets for a period of time, the failure to deliver on the promises strengthened the hand of the Fed and the market in terms of the response to faster growth and faster inflation", said Umüt, who said that the failure of US President Donald Trump to cancel the healthcare reform known as "Obamacare" strengthened the perception that he could not fulfill the promises of the expansionary fiscal policies.
The company noted that 2016 was a year of many negative events for the Turkish markets and said it was trying to close the gap with the negative BIST 100 index, which was sold out and oversold.
Umut said that they did not see a strong recovery with the domestic news flow, and noted that the current scenario could be interpreted as a trigger for the increase in risk appetite abroad and the desire to close the gap compared to similar domestic markets.
Umut noted that it had seen some snow selling in the BIST 100 index, which technically tests new records with levels of 108.600:
Especially the 109.500 to 110,000 zone, which is a critical threshold in the short term.
It's normal for profit to be sold after it's approached these levels.
We think that in the short term, there should be a new local or global story for pricing above 110,000.
For now, a 107,500 support drop could trigger a sell-off.
In this case, even if we follow the 107,000 intermediate support, I think we can see a decrease to the 106,000-105,500 region.
In particular, breaking the 105,500 mark could lead to a retreat to 104,300, which is equivalent to a Fibo of 50 percent of the rise from 100,000 to 108,600.
He said that the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be the focus of the global market, but that the expectations for the Fed are already clear, but the possibility of the balance sheet reduction program coming into force may trigger strengthening in the US dollar, although no interest rate increase is expected in the FOMC in September.
"The most important thing is what the ECB will say", he said, adding that this could trigger short-term profit selling in the emerging market (EM) stock indices, which are shadowed by over-buying.
Following the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said that the monetary policy review would be discussed in the autumn, which led to a rise in the euro/dollar pair above the level of 1.1700.
So any announcement that the 60 billion euro asset purchase program will be reduced or terminated will mean that the post-Fed liquidity on a global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing may occur in the name of markets of countries like Turkey that have high current account and where access to foreign funds is mandatory".
Erol Gürcan, the director of Gedik Yatırım Investment Advisory, also stated that after Trump's election as president in the US in November 2016, there was a very serious rally in global stock markets.
Gürcan said that the main factor that triggered this rally was the possible developments that would increase global growth expectations, including Trump's promises to reduce taxes, and noted:
Borsa Istanbul also topped the list of stocks that stood out in the global rally.
While one of the most important reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained relatively unchanged in recent years compared to similar emerging markets, it is worth mentioning that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a major role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active as of March, has a serious impact on the rise observed so far in the index.
Gürcan said that the positive developments in the rest of the year were reflected in prices and that KGF, which had an important role in this rise, was gradually reaching saturation.
Gürcan noted that the 180-day action plan, which has been eagerly awaited for some time, the introduction of regulations to support company profits, such as increasing the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, and the possible tax reduction that has recently been on the agenda, could provide a positive contribution in this regard.
Gürcan also stressed that the critical risk for developing countries is that major developed-country central banks such as the Fed, ECB and the Bank of England (BoE) will tighten their current expansionary monetary policy stance, albeit slowly, and that "the very high probability that the Fed, which has been carrying out moderate interest rate increases for some time, will initiate the balance sheet reduction process after September, the possibility that the ECB will end its asset purchase program in the near future, and the possibility that the BOE will be one of the major developed-country central banks after the Fed to raise interest rates will be the main developments to be followed".
Gürcan said that the 104.150-104.600 support area, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average with the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year, is very critical in the possible correction movements in the index in the coming period, and said that in the event of breaking this support area, the correction movement could continue until 101.700, 100.000, 99.200 levels, respectively.
Gürcan stated that if the current upward trend is maintained and the current historical peak level of 108.605 resistance is broken, the index could rise to the range of 110.000-112.000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
Authorities say a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO said in a statement that five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
Local sources say three civilians were killed in the Karabakh area of the city.
The bombing is the latest violence in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that the attack was carried out with a "personnel-guided homemade explosive" during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan army on Thursday evening.
The statement said all the injured are in good condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram air base.
Reporters say the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed at least 1,662 civilian deaths, with an average of 20% in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country's military and police.
Reporters say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have created a crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA has stopped delaying the air pollution rule after the lawsuit.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backed down from a day after the Obama administration's decision to delay a law requiring states to curb emissions of soot that causes soot, with 15 states suing the agency over the initiative.
Late Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to move forward with the "2015 Ozone Resolutions", saying the organization had demonstrated its commitment to working with the states.
EPA Chairman Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being sensitive to them".
Pruitt announced in June that he intended to delay the EPA's ozone decisions by a year, until October 2018, to measure the current smog pollution in various parts of the country and decide where cuts are mandatory to meet stricter air quality standards.
Fifteen states, mostly Democrats, and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is continuing its quest to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump calls reviving economic growth.
But these efforts have drawn backlash from Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the public health effects of more emissions.
The EPA's website says that breathing air containing ozone "may decrease lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma".
The forest has brought good news...
Line stoper and wing transfer!
Fikret Orman, the president of Beşiktaş, has given an explanation to Bein Sports about the transfer of Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and the stoper.
Fikret Orman said the following...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
We're not looking for a lot of transfers, just a point shot.
Now we're going to do a stop and wing transfer.
We have Champions League games, hopefully a good draw.
We're going to have to do a wing transfer.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have that kind of budget.
If it comes to what we call budgets, we'll transfer, or we won't die.
I can't give you any information until we have a clearer picture of the lens.
We're a public company.
The end of patience is peace.
Is the ISIS threat only for August 30th, not for the festival?
Reactions continue to be expressed against the ban imposed by the Ankara Governorate on all public events, including sit-ins, commemorative meetings and concerts, during the month of August, on the grounds of the "ISIS threat".
The governor's ban includes the phrase "all public events" while the 7th district in Ankara has a ban.
The Grand Ankara International Festival is underway.
CHP Group Vice President and Ankara MP Levent Gök told SOZCU that "there is no question that August 30 will be affected by the bans" and said:
He's seriously confused.
Even the governor's office is hesitant to decide which of the two decisions to implement.
The state's job is to create spaces for celebrations.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said, "All of Ankara has a security problem, only the organizations of Gökçek do not have a security problem".
Ankara Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka brought the ban to the House of Representatives.
Asking the Prime Minister to respond, Nazlıaka said, "Doesn't this ban clearly show the AKP's hostility to the republic and Atatürk? How do you plan to prevent millions of people from celebrating August 30 in the areas?"
"I learned from Edwina herself that I was deceived".
Demet Şener, who is still in the divorce case with İbrahim Kutluay, was in Nishantaşı with his lawyer Aslı Hatemi the day before.
She filed a civil suit against Edwina Sponza, who she claimed had destroyed her nest, and presented the photographs of Sponza and Kutluay together as evidence.
The sociable Sponza also filed a criminal complaint against Schener, saying, "Demet illegally obtained my private photographs".
"I Didn't Know What to Do"
After this latest development, Şener, who met with his lawyer in Nişantaşı Delicatessen, left the venue when he saw the journalists.
Very cheerful, Şener laughed when reminded of Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos, saying "Oh my God, I must have broken into her house and bought it".
"There is such a complaint, but the content is not true".
"We have everything; we have brought it to court", he said.
Shener, the journalists said, "Recently, everyone knew about your wife's affair with Sponza".
"How could you not know?" he was puzzled.
What? What?
How did you do that?
"I swear I didn't know", said Shener, "whether to my husband looking me in the eye or to the gossip of my poor wife".
When the journalists insisted on asking "Didn't you hear anything?" to which she replied "No", Şener continued: "Not that I didn't hear, of course I heard it the first time".
But I never believed in anything like that.
Everything was normal, normal; there was nothing to suspect.
Madam, when you send everything to me, I've learned everything, new, so...
"Was it Sponza who sent the evidence?" to which Şener answered "Yes"; he presented the photos and correspondence to the court, claiming that Sponza had sent them to him personally, confusing them.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was a hoax.
Beşiktaş is going to sign a contract with Negredo tomorrow.
The Beşiktaş Club will officially admit Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo to their squad tomorrow.
The signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, who Beşiktaş has agreed in principle with the Spanish club Valencia.
The signing ceremony, which will be attended by the club president Fikret Orman, will take place at 12:00.
By the way, the Spanish footballer is going to have a medical check-up tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar's Minister of Economy and Trade Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani expressed his gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: "Thank you so much for your honorable attitude and your support for us".
I also send greetings from the Emir of Qatar to my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Qatari economy has proven its resilience.
Our economy is strong, while many other countries' economies are being adversely affected.
We must work with all our strength to make Qatar independent and strong.
We broke the embargo against us in a matter of hours, thanks to Turkey.
We're not short of anything right now.
Our natural resources, our natural gas exports are a huge boost to the Qatari economy.
We were not affected by the blockade, which was carried out against us mercilessly and against the law, thanks to Turkey.
Today, Qatar is once again the world's largest producer of natural gas and LNG.
"After what happened, we did not experience a decrease in our natural gas exports, but rather an increase of 30 percent", he said.
Al Thani said that the brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey and the work in all areas continue, "The volume of trade between us in the first quarter was 554 million dollars".
And the decisions made recently have played a big part in this.
The acceleration of the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors, the investment in many areas is extremely important for us.
"Thank you very much for your constructive attitude toward us", he said.
The cost of recent disasters is 300 million TL
TSB President Can Akın Çağlar said that after the flood on July 18, insurance companies were reported damages of 116 million TL, on July 21 in the earthquake of Gökova 12 million lira 800 damage was reported and on July 27 in the flood and hail in Istanbul 168 million lira 22 thousand damage reports were reported, the last three incidents cost insurance costs of 300 million lira.
"In terms of insurance, the damage caused by the flood is around 3,500 lira per vehicle, and the damage to the glass is around 1,000 lira".
"In the earthquake, the average housing damage was 6 thousand lira", he said.
Stressing that they are making intensive efforts as a sector to compensate for economic losses, Can Akın Çağlar said that 3 out of every 4 people do not have housing insurance, 1 out of every 2 businesses does not have fire insurance and 2 out of every 3 people do not have kasko insurance, saying: "The risk of natural disaster increases due to climate change".
The risk of our citizens and institutions facing serious damage costs is growing every day due to the low uninsured rate in our country.
These costs should not be left entirely to the state.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as they seem, and insurance is not just a business that pays for damages; it's also a business that does risk management consulting.
It's important to raise insurance awareness and coverage for our people and our country.
Canın Akın Çağlar, "The general conditions of Kasko insurance state that the insured have to report their damages within 5 working days and this period ended yesterday".
"Will the insured be a victim?" he replied: "In general, such a period is possible, but the statute of limitations in the Commercial Code is 2 years".
"Also, this is a natural disaster, so there's no need for the insured to panic, no company will say they're not paying".
That's how the German media saw the giant auction!
At a time when tensions between Turkey and Germany were growing, the German company Siemens won the tender for Turkey's first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Sources Fields (YEKA) tender.
The German media announced this development with the words "German Siemens won the giant tender in Turkey".
DWelle Türkçe reported that the YEKA tender was won by the Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon consortium, which said, "The consortium will invest over 1 billion dollars in the wind plant".
"The tender for the creation of a thousand megawatt wind power capacity is the first YEKA tender in Turkey", the newspaper said, adding that the number of companies competing in the tender had dropped from 8 to 2, facing the Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortiums, and the Chinese Mingliyang consortium withdrew from the tender at the beginning of the 30th round.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak, who made a statement after the takeover, made striking statements about Turkey-Germany relations.
The bid was won by the German company Siemens, and we can say that this picture is an important message for the region and the world.
Looking at the 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this result will make a significant contribution to Turkish-German relations.
I am proud to say that Turkey is the most reliable country in the region and the world to invest in, despite the regional crises in the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible match
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will cross paths in the near future to deliver the most satisfying boxing match for 147 pounds, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia walked down the hall and saluted World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
With a unanimous vote on Showtime on Saturday, former four-time world champion Adrien Broner was among the top five on the uncensored list, after Garcia beat him.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you".
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN Saturday night at 7:00.
As the two posed for photographs, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential fight between the fighters would be "perfectly sized".
Garcia made a "I fucked a fur" reminder.
"I've climbed to 140 pounds for Broner, but I'm not that big.
That's small for 140.
I want to get off the light bike.
He's got to go to the lightweight division, so we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give it to them".
Lomachenko has joined.
"Boxing needs this fight".
Klimas asked if it should be 'play and watch'; setting a date for next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) and having Lomachenko fight in a 135 pound opening bout later this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell bout for the lightweight title at the Forum on September 23.
Garcia said, "The fight could be on 'watch and see' because all the fans want it", and later said he was open to whichever channel offered the best financial package.
We are the main names.
No other name has generated this level of interest.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he admired Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and could attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko, who had praised Garcia profusely, hesitated on his knees and said he thought the three-cycle champion from Riverside looked "too slow", "sorry, Mikey... you wanted the knockout".
Garcia said the focus is on showing punching power first, then boxing.
Both said they felt the momentum was created for their own encounter.
"This is a fight that must be fought.
No other fight has generated this much interest and buzz.
Garcia said, "I'm very happy to be doing this".
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight".
The Turkish race from Russia to America
The White House does not plan to impose sanctions that would affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions on Russia could increase the cost of those pipelines.
And the reason is the cost of borrowing.
Concerned that Western investors might consider pulling out of the projects because of sanctions, the Kremlin has stepped up pipeline construction in response.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which is building the Turkish Stream pipeline, which is planned to reach Turkey from the Black Sea, hastened construction on Gazprom's request.
Reuters reported that Gazprom has also started the construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream "in a hurry" in order to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's illiteracy age assessment test have been released
In Sweden, the latest results of a new medical age assessment test for refugees show that more than 80 percent of the subjects are over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the test.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age estimates more accurate during the asylum process after criticism of the Swedish Migration Agency's (Migrationsverket) failure to assess the exact age of some of the refugees who claimed to be underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test and the Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceutical Directorate has now released the results of 2481 of the tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (of the 2002 figure) were judged to be 18 or over, and in 25 cases the Office of Forensic Medicine judged the subject to be "probably 18 or over".
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18".
The tests were only done in cases where the person's age was suspect.
According to Johan Göransson of the Department of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with the past months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics from last month, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases that are judged to be over 18 years old does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their age.
The department explained the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases "where the examined individuals were shown to be 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 cases that were reported, it found that 243 cases openly declared that they had turned 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which involves taking X-rays of the teeth of 20-year-olds and doing MRI scans of the knee joints, then having them analyzed by dentists and radiologists, is being criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work assesses the biological maturity of people who enter the nebula earlier or later than normal.
"I have reason to think about it, and I think that's not the kind of measurement that should be used.
It's very suspicious to judge biological age that way.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend it is".
However, Göransson of the Office of Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals defended the accuracy of the tests: "You could say that the risk of a child being wrongly judged to be an adult in general is small.
The greatest risk is that the person is just under 18, and in this case the risk is about 10 percent".
Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque is opened for worship today
The Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdülhamit in 1885 and commissioned by architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened for worship with Friday prayers after the restoration work.
District Director Mürsel Sarı said that the restoration works started in June 2013 have been completed and the mosque is ready for opening.
Yellow gave the following information: "Restoration work was carried out in 2 scopes".
The first part was the repair of the mosque, the main building.
The second part was the landscaping.
The first part was about 16 million lira, and the environmental regulation was about 11 million lira.
First the wooden dome was opened, then the exterior walls were renovated, the dirt and rust were removed.
Drains were made for reinforcement.
There are very rich embroidery patterns as we can see when we go inside the glass.
It's a star-motivated piece, and it's very rich in pencil work.
There's a mixed style here.
"The traces of the hammer are also visible, "in the Ottoman and Baroque architecture, "that had become the factor, "if we consider that it was built in 1885".
The United States government has a job.
"The image of the German Emperor II in the central square of the mosque".
They had partial malfunctions, were cleaned up and put back in place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
On either side of the mosque are wooden cages, symmetrical, which we call the salam.
We know that these were made by our great Khan, Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we know that he made these things himself and that he assembled them here.
They're still standing here in their original form.
Sarı said that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to attend the opening ceremony of the mosque.
The claim of Pantic in Göztepe
The Ukrainian press reported that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer who did not make the squad at Dinoma Kiev could be loaned to the yellow-red club.
Pantic, who started in the Red Star team of the football country of Serbia, wore the Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves jerseys in Spain.
Pantic signed for Dinamo Kiev in the offseason last season.
The governor of West Virginia has announced that he will be changing parties.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced his change of party at a rally with President Trump on Thursday night.
Governor Justice said, "Like it or not, the Democrats have abandoned me".
"Today I will tell you with much prayer and thought... "that as West Virginians, I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor".
The meeting was overwhelmed with cheers.
"So tomorrow I'll change my record to Republican", Justice added.
"If I were the technical director, I'd say it's time for you to play a different game".
Mr. Trump had promised to make an important announcement earlier at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and the Democratic nominee, Justice, did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state, Justice was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he inherited his father's coal business, and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Convention issued a statement Thursday night saying that "Vali Justice's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which has preferred to work to prevent him from making our country great again".
RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS, "With only 15 governorships and the least number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and cannot find a positive, unifying message".
I will do what is best for Turkey.
Third in the Olympics, Turkish record holder.
He was born in Cuba, but he came to Turkey for F. Bahçe and he considered Turkey his homeland...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national uniform...
First European champion, then Olympic third...
Now he is one of Turkey's most important medal hopes at the World Athletics Championships.
Yasmani Capello, competing in the 400-meter hurdles, spoke to SABAH ahead of the championship that begins today.
When you were younger, in Cuba, they didn't want you because they didn't like your grades.
You hired a coach to improve your own.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some people think you chose Turkey for money.
What do you think?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was leaving the national team.
And from that moment on, I can say I drew a line on what I was going through.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
I got into the national team thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They made me an offer for reinforcements.
I've turned a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of disability in my youth, but after the opportunities I had in Turkey, I had great success in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to do my best at the World Athletics Championships and win a different title.
You cried at the press conference the other day.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever I get asked about Turkey taking me in, I think about my childhood, being kicked out of the Cuban national team at the age of 23.
And of course, people in Turkey are coming to me.
I felt similarly when I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam and when the March of Independence was played.
I couldn't hold back the tears.
And I'm very grateful to Turkey for giving me the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I'm so happy you're on the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said before that you might have a Turkish boyfriend.
You're with a Turk now, you went to Cuba together.
You want to share your experiences?
The biggest plus of being with a Turk is the calmness...
Peace of mind compared to Cuban women...
Turkish girls are taking control of their relationships.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant coach.
You spend all day together, does it interfere with your diet, for example?
He eats more sweets than I do.
(Both laugh) I don't really have a strict diet, but it does interfere with what I eat from time to time.
My trainer Massimo Matrone has often warned me about my diet, but I know it's for my own good.
How are you with Turkish food, does your girlfriend cook for you?
Turkish women make great food, but my boyfriend makes it better.
(Laughter) Dry beans and rice are my first choice.
It 's just a smile .
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He replaced me with other young people.
After winning medals for Turkey, we met in Cuba.
He looked at my face, pointed me out to the young athletes next to me, and said, "Look, I raised him".
I just laughed at him.
I 'm looking forward to my retirement .
The question of the glasses you wear at the races...
I just use it for concentration.
The moment I put on my glasses, I cut off all contact with the world and build a wall on both sides.
I'm just focused on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
When you think of Tokyo 2020, what comes to mind?
I was thinking about Felix Sanchez.
She won the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles at the 2012 London Olympics at the age of 35.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33, why not.
Turquoise is supportive
Turkcell Deputy General Manager İsmail Bütün said that he believed that Yasmani Capello would succeed in London and said, "We sincerely believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in the best way in this championship as well".
We wish all our athletes good luck in London.
"We will continue to support the further development of Turkish athletics and the greater successes that will come to our country", he said.
Coe praises Russia's 'same' apology for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the global athletics patron, praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal, which he described as sincere, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics patron Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's ban from the sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to "all athletes who have had their gold and silver medals forcibly taken from them".
Despite its own assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
IAAF President Coe told reporters, "I think today was a very heartfelt response, a very heartfelt presentation".
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted him, that he had survived the most turbulent days and had done everything possible to ensure the reconstruction of the federation"...
Coe said he was "pleased" that Russia agreed to his re-admission criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think it's moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendation that the task force is not the right time to return Russia's rights", Coe said.
"We must do everything we can to normalize this situation over the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to separate the clean athletes from the flawed system".
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria will compete as neutrals in the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many of the criteria for the return of their rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still insufficient and that banned coaches were still running free.
Denying the news of 'tanks' from the US to the YPG
The US Embassy in Ankara has stated that no tanks have been delivered to any of the parties fighting in Syria.
The allegations that hundreds of trucks full of tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG were denied.
The Embassy issued a statement titled "Clarification on false news in the press about the trucks going to Syria".
In a series of false reports in the media over the past few days, it has been falsely claimed that the US has sent hundreds of tanks and trucks full of weapons to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The U.S. hasn't given tanks to any of the groups fighting ISIS in Syria.
A large part of US military aid, which consists primarily of light weapons and ammunition, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAC) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
Syrian Arabs, including the KSA, are fighting to clear the Dea'a area and return to their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment will be higher than last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said that 55 percent of all the investments that came in last year came after July.
Ermut said that there was no decrease in investments due to the attempted coup of July 15 by FETÖ, but on the contrary an increase, "Maybe there would have been more increase, but it was not".
Maybe if these conditions hadn't been created, if there hadn't been some regional development, we could have seen a bigger increase in the impact.
So we're more optimistic about next year.
Hopefully, we'll have a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
We're already up 11% in the first five months of the year, compared to the first five months of last year.
But we don't find that enough.
"We hope there will be more", he said.
"We are not worried about global or regional developments", Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut, who normally reminds that 75 percent of direct investments until 2010 came from Europe, continued:
That number has dropped to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share went from 2 percent to 7 to 8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
And as we were trying to do that, the Gulf countries had some problems with each other.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two important actors.
But the problem between the two countries is upsetting us and is causing investors to delay their decisions a bit longer.
We may be experiencing some delays, not just in terms of investments in Turkey, but because of that.
Arda Ermut recalled that some events had taken place in Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had a clear and definite reaction to this situation.
When they talked about investors from countries that have experienced the most severe political crisis, President Erdoğan's reaction was, "Look, problems happen between governments, not between peoples".
Secondly, these people have come to invest in my country.
These are no different to us from Turkish companies.
On the contrary, when they have the slightest problem, they come to us, we solve it.
"We will definitely not allow them to be victims", Ermut said, adding that they would continue to support all investors with the comfort of this.
Erm, "We can guarantee that in the future".
You will see that neither German companies nor investors from countries where we have some problems politically will have any trouble.
On the contrary, we hope that we will do our best to increase the investment from these countries.
We think the investment from here will continue to grow.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment climate.
"But we will do our part at this point and do our best to ensure that our investors and the perception of the investment environment are not affected".
TYDTA President Ermut said that after the one-rail-one-way strategy, Turkey has started to receive great interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf are solved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"In the relations with Germany, not a single investor said, 'We have suffered because of these relations, we had investments because of this event, we are fleeing'", Ermut, who used the phrases, said that there are companies that come, come and follow.
Ermut, "Right now, about 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies".
So almost 10 percent of all the companies we talk to around the world are German companies.
Some of them are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
He's got a business that's going to grow or something, and we're holding it open as a project.
"So German companies are still a big part of our daily workflow", he said.
Ermut stressed that all state institutions should be careful during the period when detection operations are carried out in Turkey, and said that the issue is sensitive and the slightest bad communication could be affected.
Ermut said that the past 2-3 weeks were a good lesson for her.
Investors and politicians have different agendas.
We've always seen that economic relations always kind of set the stage for political developments.
Germany will remain our most important trading partner and most important investor.
Because they have a lot of investments in Turkey right now.
The election agenda in Germany unfortunately also increases this kind of discourse.
I think it'll be a little easier once they're gone.
In the Saudi Arabia case, both countries are careful not to make a negative statement.
As a result, an investor who invests in Turkey is investing by targeting all the surrounding markets.
So it's not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, that there's been a bit of a slowdown.
But we're still in talks with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are waiting for a decision that might be quicker.
Negatively, we don't have any Saudi investors who say, 'I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I'm leaving here.'
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who are still living in Turkey, who are on vacation here and who are also in contact with us, and we follow all their processes.
Arda Ermut, recalling that last year, foreign direct investment (FDI) to Turkey was 12.3 billion dollars, said, "I think we will definitely exceed that this year.
"But how far we go will be affected by regional developments, global uncertainties".
Ermut, who hopes that the impact of the multiplier will be more, but perhaps a little more limited, said that the first 5 months were with an increase of 11 percent, indicating that this could be preserved, "If there is no bad development, I believe that we will definitely close the end of the year better than last year".
Ermut, who said that a significant part of the investments will continue to be in real estate, said that new investments could be seen in logistics, health, fintech, information technology, petrochemical, food, energy and manufacturing.
Ermut emphasized that they will announce new investments in the coming months, "We may have an investment announcement in the sense of manufacturing in the near future".
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There may be investments from interested countries".
Operation of 4 wine companies in 9 cities: 55 arrests
The teams of the Istanbul Smuggling Crime Branch Directorate found that the foil covering of the mushroom tapes on the products sold by 4 wine firms was long and loose and that the bandrolles were not glued to the bottles, that the TAPDK bandrolles glued on the coating were collected after the products were sold and that they were marketed by sticking to the newly produced wines.

Police teams searching a warehouse were seen removing the caps on the bottles of ready-to-sell wine.
Bags full of used bottles, TAPDK bandroll caps, police teams were recorded examining them.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's trip to Paris?
The rules to prevent European football clubs from spending unlimited money will not prevent Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona, Spain to Paris Saint-Germain, France.
The prestigious Champions League tournament has the power to ban teams from the UEFA, the governing body of European football, to Paris Saint-Germain.
The Financial Fair Play rules, imposed by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to show that it financed Neymar's transfer without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of contract, and Neymar will command a salary that will bring in tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France are:
Given the money the team gets from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG could certainly afford to sign Neymar and add him to their galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to buy players, but they have to balance it with legitimate sources of income, provided they get to the top of their football-related business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former Frenchman believed that clubs that incurred huge debts in the pursuit of success were effectively cheating, and were at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP began to monitor club losses instead of focusing on debts.
The change meant that the model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 (buy a club with potential, spend heavily to improve the team, and build a global brand) was transformed into a more challenging venture.
In the three-year FFP evaluation period, which runs until 2018, clubs can suffer losses of up to 30 million euros.
Despite Platini's unfair removal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, remains adamant that the overspending should be stopped.
Andrea Traverso, who runs FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules by moving forward".
Although PSG will pay Neymar's purchase price in full, it may spread the amount over the contract for accounting reasons.
Neymar signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee can be shown as a cost of 44.4 million euros in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw the most severe sanctions applied to Manchester City, which is owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and ordered to limit the Champions League squad to 21 players instead of the usual 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that may try to defraud financial regulators by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company may sponsor PSG, UEFA will not allow it to be counted as legitimate income if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market values.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the sponsorship of Qatar Tourism Authority for PSG was overstated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings from PSG could come through payments to Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar will be a World Cup ambassador in 2022, and such a move could easily be exposed by UEFA organisers.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be more careful against attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to sources on Tuesday, UEFA is not in pre-emptive talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
Recently published figures show that PSG made a profit of 542.4 million euros in 2015-16 with a turnover of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not been published yet.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to their sponsorship deals, gift and shirt sales.
The club expects the fee to increase by at least 30% once the signing is done.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of football's greatest players, tried to block Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG had violated the FFP.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS that Qatar is the absolute owner of PSG, saying "This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state".
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports giant, shares his concerns about La Liga being funded by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday, "This is the result of ownership and it has completely changed the whole face of football in the last 15 years".
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It's very difficult to respect Financial Fair Play, because for a country, to have a big player representing a country, it can lead to having different methods or different interests.
The insurers are in revolt over the "high price"
According to the TSB, the insurance industry has been losing money in the traffic industry since 2006.
The sector, which lost 2.35 billion TL in 2015, made only 19 million TL in profit in 2016.
The exchange is operated by Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Güneş Sigorta.
Speaking at the meeting where TSB's first half-year results were evaluated, Çağlar said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion TL, and the sector's loss with the ceiling premium application this year is 2.3 billion TL, and the estimated damage-premium ratio is 125 percent.
Çağlar, who said that the 2015 figure will be captured this year, pointed out that the loss recorded in 2012 and 2015 also took the profit of other industries, "This means that by financing the bad driver, we increase the price of the citizen's housing policy".
"The sector is 75 percent foreign, and our partners abroad are financing the bad driver in a sense", he said.
The ages, he went on:
We don't expect to make a profit from traffic, but we've never made a profit in the last 11 years.
"We accept that, but we hope that we can carry that loss in a reasonable environment with the other policies".
"In 2012, traffic insurance had price increases of around 30 percent, in 2015 it almost doubled, we recorded the biggest loss in our history", Çağlar said.
"Even in an environment where prices have increased so much, at the end of 2016, our profit in traffic was only 19 million TL", he said.
Çağlar said that they expect the free tariff to be passed next year, "We will reduce the price of the good driver and apply a high price to the bad driver".
"But the Treasury is looking at the general course, and Treasury has the final say on when it will happen", he said.
The Treasury Ministry has stated that the rise in mandatory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a wide section of the society, and has switched to the practice of maximum premium (ceiling price) from April 12.
The maximum premiums for compulsory traffic insurance policies were determined on the basis of the annual groups, taking into account the statistics of each vehicle group, the number of vehicles and the traffic density and accident statistics.
On the other hand, as of July, the "Risk Insured Pool" was implemented for high-frequency damage in compulsory traffic insurance or vehicle groups.
The premiums and losses for the pool's traffic insurance policies will be shared among the insurance companies.
The premiums of these policyholders will be determined by the Treasury Board.
Çağlar said that with the application of ceiling premium in traffic, premium production in the first 6 months of 2017 decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, while the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, and the discount in traffic policies reached about 30 percent when taking into account inflation.
Chaglar said that this year the traffic will again take the profits in other branches, "This loss cannot be sustained with these ceiling prices.
How much more can the industry take this damage?"
Çağlar, who said that the capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, and that the capital of the sector would be finished in three years if only 2.3 billion TL was lost from traffic, "Foreigners look at 'Why does a good driver finance a bad driver, why do my thousands of shareholders finance a bad driver in Turkey?' "
"We're trying to get the Treasury on our side at this point", he said.
Asked whether the foreigners' weight in the Turkish insurance sector has reached a point of reduction, Çağlar said, "They have not reached that point yet".
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands, the average is six policies per person, while in Turkey it's 1.3.
"So Turkey is a place that really needs to grow", he said, and continued:
So they're not giving up on this.
But the company makes a reasonable profit every year, but it keeps all the profits and uses them to grow the company.
According to TSB data, in 2016, the premium production in the sector was 40.5 billion TL, while in the first half of this year it was 23.1 billion TL, with an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period last year.
Çağlar said he predicted the sector would not finish the year with 15 percent growth in total premium production.
Social welfare gospel for thousands of chronic patients
The details and principles of implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases" which started its work some time ago with the instruction of Minister of Family and Social Policies Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya became known.
The social assistance program for poor citizens and their families will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first phase.
Patients will be provided with monthly support over two thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The Ministry will also pay additional compensation to tuberculosis patients who are unable to pay for their own medical care, are bed-ridden or whose home living conditions need to be improved, as determined by the relevant health department.
Payments will be made through PTT through Social Assistance Cards.
Those who cannot go to the bank for geographical reasons, illness, disability, etc. will be paid at the door.
The programme is also a world first in many ways.
One in 10 companies that will invest is still German.
Arda Ermut, head of the Investment Support and Promotion Agency of the Prime Minister's Office, said that the political tension between the two countries was not reflected in the business world, as German firms in Turkey were seen as Turkish firms.
Ermut said that "in the relations with Germany, there is not a single investor who says, 'We are running away from the hardships of this situation'".
Ermut, "About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies".
Some of it is invested in Turkey.
"Germans are an important part of our daily workflow", he said.
Ermut said that the Abraaj Group's partnership with the logistics company Netlog is a good example.
Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed pointed to the economic growth in Turkey and said, "We have invested a total of 1 billion dollars in Turkey".
Özer, on his way to becoming the last Ottoman
It was reported that the experienced footballer, who the management gave two weeks to find a club, has agreed with Osmanlıspor and will sign the official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of the season, Özer Hurmacı, who signed a contract with the green-black club until 2019, contributed significantly to the team with 5 goals and 4 assists while wearing the form in 29 league, 2 cup matches.
The management, who had closed the way back to Özer, had signed Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday to replace him.
The transfer of the century has taken place!
Barcelona announced that Neymar has been transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of 222 million euros.
The transfer development, which the football community has been following with excitement recently, has been officially revealed.
PSG paid the Catalan team 222 million euros for the Brazilian player, the price of the player's release, adding the star name to the squad.
Neymar, with the price of the bonservis, became the most expensive transfer in the history of football.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), a team from France's Ligue 1 football league, announced that it has signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
The club's website said that Neymar, who is the world's most expensive footballer at the age of 25 and was paid €222 million for the bonservis, signed a contract that will see him wear the PSG shirt until June 30, 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to be wearing the French national team shirt, "Since I started my football career in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most competitive and ambitious teams".
"The reason I came to this club and joined my teammates is to win as many trophies as our fans desired".
PSG will pay Neymar €45 million for each season.
The cost of the star player will therefore cost the French representative over 400 million euros.
The maritime workers' strike ended with a raise.
The collective agreement between İzmir Metropolitan Municipality's company İZDENİZ A.Ş. and the Turkish Denizciler Sendikası (TDS) affiliated to Türk-İş was not agreed upon.
On this, the union members of İZDENİZ went on strike on July 12.
The strike, which lasted for nearly a month, ended today at 15:00 after the workers were given a raise.
According to the collective agreement, the salaries of the ground staff of the IZDENIZ will be increased by 12 percent.
The Income Tax exemption of the Izdeniz, which renewed its fleet, was obtained after the registration of the International Ship Sicily, along with the salary increase of 25 percent, while the increase rate for the personnel in the status of the shipman was 5 percent.
The General Directorate of the Navy announced that the internal bay will continue with the normal schedule, the Yassıcaada will start on Tuesday, and the Foça and Urla will start from next weekend.
TDS chairman Hasan Pekdemir said that they have locked transportation with their 23 days of strikes and said: "The people of Izmir will be relieved".
As a result of the strike, the wages of our workers on land and at sea have been improved.
We leave the table in a satisfied manner.
The average sailor will get 28% of the salary, while the average sailor will get 20% of the salary.
We had friends who worked at minimum wage.
We've made some serious improvements in their salaries.
Nostalgia is a niche with "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So, the characters are nostalgic for the glory days of the '80s, the grunge era of the '90s, when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter did the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV, and for the year itself, 2001, before their stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved on to bigger things, this version of the story for all of them.
As a cultural product, this is both the personification and the embodiment of our timeless memorial Facebook.
But as a series, it's kind of out of date.
"The First Day of Camp" was an unexpected success, and not only because of its absurd humour (inside, a talking box, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin, contained a story about the origins of the plant).
By concentrating on the main comic (middle-aged actors playing the adult prodigal children), he realized the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
Now, "Ten Years Later", where the adults play the adults, is less emotionally based and more parody-driven, including a monologue about a perverted cult film from the '90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Crib".
At one point, the character mixes an Apple Powerbook, some single-wheel skates and "a lot of other stuff from 1991".
Many of the core stories are the same.
Soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is no longer a writer, he still can't get over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy, treacherous plot, masterminded by George H. W. Bush, a very well-rehearsed mock-up by Michael Ian Black, involving Ronald Reagan, again Mr. Showalter.
As usual, the best part of the series is the interludes.
Especially the ever-young Mr. Rudd with the lip-grasper in Matt Dillon's "The Bakers", whose Andy, the most popular kid in the old school, looks like an old man now.
There may be random moments of madness that power the series (like a recurring "Seven Up!" series) until it reaches what I think is the logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", in which the final scene ensures that the crew of friends go to the premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: "The Americans" with its Cold War re-awakening, the film "Blown Bomb" and even "GLOW" with its iconography against East-West wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, looks like found TV: a 1980s Romanian buddy cop drama in which two Bucharest police officers fight for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles are played by the wolf Gregor and the idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with the English dubs of their dialogues by Channing Tatum (who is also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a very bright idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some amusing visual comedies (Americans watching football, cops watching chess on TV)
And the famous cast of voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, is good material for the "who's who" game.
But "Commade Detective" is so dedicated to making a bogus propaganda drama seem like reality (including a killer wearing a Reagan mask), that it often plays out exactly like him.
It doesn't go through six long chapters, and the comedy isn't quick enough or frequent enough.
Gregor and Iosef are constantly visiting the American Embassy, where two fat men are always eating a bunch of hamburgers like hungry wolves in their lobby, and "Commando Detective" could have done a better job of propaganda if it had been shortened to a shorter length.
A message to the imaginary communist viewer that Western culture can turn anything into edible mass.
The Romanian creators are not wrong: we do this to our own recent past and even to theirs.
The forefathers of FETO
The British Government has seen in fifty years of experience that our family is loyal and self-sacrificing.
The highest officers of the government have acknowledged that this family has been a long-standing and loyal servant of the British government.
The British Government must be wise and careful about this plant they have planted with their own hands, and must study and consider everything carefully and decide carefully.
In trying to understand the FETÖ, the starting point is the organization of the Popes, but a crucial difference that is forgotten is that FETÖ is an organization that emerged in the imperialist period and operated with colonial intentions.
The 'leading movement' that should be addressed in this Minval is, in my opinion, the Kadyanis.
The person who describes himself in the British praise as 'the sapling planted by the hands of the British Government' is Mirza Ghulam Ahmet Kadiyani, the founder of Kadıyanilik.
Ghulam Ahmed, a native of Kadyan, a small town in the Punjab state of India, reported that "on December 1, 1888, Allah commanded him to take a be'at from his followers and form a separate congregation".
Going a little further, Ghulam Ahmad said that in 1891, according to the revelations and inspirations he received, Jesus died a natural death like the other prophets, and that Allah sent him as the Messiah and Mahdi awaited by Christians and Muslims.
According to this, the messiah and the Mahdi that Muslims are waiting for is the same person, which is Mirza Ghulam Ahmed Kadyani.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV) The first book of the Bible was written by the prophet Isaiah.
In India, which came under British rule after the Sipahi uprising of 1857, Ghulam Ahmed, who wrote books defending Muslims under persecution against Hindus and Christians, recalls the portrait of Gulen, who defended Islam against irreligion with the presidency of the Association for Combating Communism in Erzurum, which was supposedly founded entirely by the Sacrilectists but later emerged with the support of the CIA.
Like Gülen, Ghulam Ahmed's idea, which is the most beloved by imperialists, is that "jihad" is a struggle that Muslims only have with their own selves, and that if you can freely practice your religion, there is no dimension of imperialism to be fought.
You may recall that Gülen went a step further and even praised the attacks of the Crusaders, whose wounds in our history are still open, in a 'sermon' last year: "The Crusader's occupation of your country is not very dangerous.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
For one thing, they don't have sex with your wife, your daughter.
They don't touch your temple, the untouched Crusaders!
The idea that the Mahdi and the Messiah were united in him, the idea that his congregation would be the savior of Islam, the similarity of the theses with FETÖ, such as the concept of jihad, meant only the struggle with the elite, besides the way Kadıyanlılılığın was spread in the field of education and civil society in general.
The number of Kadıyanis' centers in the world, which is said to exceed 2 million, is 1869, the number of countries where the emergency aid organization "Humanity First" is officially registered is 23.
The data also includes 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 Qadiyan printers in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and nearly 16,000 mosques around the world.
Given that the "first Muslim scientist" to receive the Nobel Prize was Prof. Abdusslam, Sir Zaferullah Khan, who served as President of the United Nations Court of Justice, and Mahershala Ali, "the first Muslim actor to receive the Oscar", were Kadyanis, we can see the depth of the approval of the global powers for the Kadyanis.
Let's note that the women's meeting in England last week, with 30,000 people, was also polished as a body show.
One of their slogans is "Love everyone, hate no one", but a brief look at their history is enough to understand that the Kadyyanis actually meant "love your occupiers/colonizers".
The origins and motivations of structures such as the Hülasa, FETÖ or Tahir-ul Kadri can be traced back to the Kadıyânî and all these organizations are in fact supported as a way to corrupt societies in order to serve imperialism and serve colonialism.
"Last wish" came out of the cargo.
Emily Pomeranz, 50, who spent her last days in a Washington hospital for pancreatic cancer, expressed her longing for a milkshake that was a coffee and chocolate mix from a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has owned the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on dry ice and paid $123 for it, sending it in a "fast-delivery" cargo to a hospital 600 kilometers away.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
Ahmet Kul İnşa, which has so far implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has put up for sale 7 projects in Dia Mare in Istanbul Mimaroba and Solse in Bodrum Yalıkavak.
The Dia Mare project, developed by its architect Çamoğlu Architecture, was developed to take maximum advantage of the sea.
Dia Mare, which covers an area of 11 thousand square meters, has a total of 188 residential and 17 commercial units.
The rough-hewn project will be handed over to the new owners in March 2018.
Dia Mare has many types of circles ranging from 2+1 to 5+1.
The company will commission two new sites in Mimaroba and Bitez this year, and is preparing to sign two large projects in Topkapı in 2018.
He transferred 753 million to affiliates.
Yarkadaş said that many programs were made to be done outside of TRT, where 6,760 personnel are employed, and that exorbitant prices were paid.
CHP deputy, "TRT 2016" again withdrew the nation's taxes to AKP companies".
"This is called robbery", he said...
The source that TRT passed on to the affiliated production companies was revealed by data obtained from official documents.
The official response to the application made by CHP Istanbul MP Barış Yarkadaş under the Acquisition of Information Act exposed how TRT's resources are spent.
Yarkadaş said that despite all technical possibilities, TRT, which employs 6,760 people, transferred 753 million 500 thousand TL to affiliated companies in 2016 through programs under the name of outsourcing.
The CHP deputy used the phrase "This means stress".
Barış Yarkadaş said that "the production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are looting TRT".
"Millions are paid for productions that are not seen or that are not known to be filmed".
"The institution with 7 thousand personnel has become the AKP's arsenal", Yarkadaş said, recalling that the money transferred to the companies was collected from the people's taxes.
"What programs did these companies sign that 7,000 people couldn't do and they got this money?"
Yarkadaş stated that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was 224.456.182 TL, adding that the advertising revenue was negligible when staff salaries and other expenses were taken into account.
"TRT, which has become the voice of AKP, cannot get advertising because it is not followed".
The feeding journalists are paid by TRT, shouting for the AKP.
"And the people bear the burden", he said.
Yarkadaş from CHP continued: "TRT pays 660 million TL per year to the staff, but all the work is given to the external productions".
753.5 trillion dollars was withdrawn from the TRT, from the people's pocket, to the supporters.
This is a disgrace.
He stopped the suicide and got down on his knees and apologized to his wife.
The incident occurred at a car park in the Eyupoglu neighborhood of the city, on the street of the Mill.
According to the information, the residents of the area reported the situation to the fire and health teams after seeing the citizen hanging from the 4th floor of the car park.
Firefighters arrived at the scene and opened fire while paramedics waited.
After about 1 hour of convincing efforts by the psychologists and police teams called to the scene, 34-year-old father of three children Yunus G. who gave up on suicide, apologized kneeling in front of his wife N.G. who watched him in tears.
On the other hand, about 100 people sat on the sidewalks in the street where Yunus G. who attempted suicide was watching the situation, while some citizens recorded with their cell phones.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon after it reduced its speculation that slow economic growth and a move to inflation would be a boost.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be "slow" as they kept interest rates steady, along with shrinking family incomes.
The bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent, so fewer members have called for increases this month after slow economic growth weakened support for growth.
The Bank raised its growth forecast in its quarterly inflation report to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household incomes would continue to contract, with inflation still expected to rise to close to 3% in the spring.
However, he indicated that interest rate hikes are needed to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation over the next few years, and said borrowing costs could remain higher than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to roll back part of the massive post-Brexit economic recovery package launched a year ago.
The bank will end its Periodic Funding Scheme, which offers cheap financing to banks, from next February, but said it expected to provide a further £15 billion (£115 billion in total) under the scheme.
Minutes after the interest rate decision was made, the bank said: "The central estimate of the MPC is that the gross domestic product (GDP) is slowing down in the short term as the narrowing of real household incomes continues to be a burden on consumption".
On interest rates, he stressed that "some tightening in monetary policy" may be necessary to mitigate inflation and that the market would be "a bit higher" than expected.
Markets are still predicting the first rise will be in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
According to the May projections, the bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
The bank maintains its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and euro following the news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change came after the latest growth figures, which were disappointing with GDP growing by 0.2% in the previous three months compared to 0.3% in the second quarter, softened expectations of a multiple increase.
Growth will probably remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will begin to show a slight increase towards the end of the year.
While the bank says the downturn will get worse before it gets better, the latest inflation report leaves households, hit by soaring inflation and meager wage increases, with little to rejoice about.
The bank said that monetary policy would "not prevent" income shocks in the next few years, but that it expected wages to improve "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The rise in demand for British goods as a result of the weak pound will help the economy by offsetting some of the declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the pound was voted down to 0.25% in August, following the shock EU referendum.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
The bank's latest interest rate decision was preceded by a call for an interest rate increase that was due to the rising inflationary pressures on struggling households and a call by three policymakers for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank says this is expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess was "totally" due to the weak pound against its own 2% target.
Andrew Montlake, a director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given recent declines in interest rates, the mortgage market will once again become more competitive with lenders demanding that business be done and the year be closed positively.
The market looks good in re-mortgages, especially for those nearing the end of their existing contracts, with many free options and low interest rates, becoming more popular than ever".
The NHS is going to prescribe the controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people.
Following a fight in the High Court over the funding of the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to access 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by around 86 per cent in high-risk people, will be provided by health services to an estimated 10,000 people in a three-year pre-trial.
The Supreme Court's decision last year, following the Court of Appeal's approval, agreed to fund the trial, saying that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP, despite claims that local authorities were funding it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a 'new and serious intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'turning point'.
Sexual health clinics in Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register for the public, with more clinics joining in October to be fully implemented across the UK by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV medications that reduce the risk of contracting HIV before sex.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Getting PrEP before sex means that a person has enough of the medication to prevent HIV infection from taking root in their body.
These drugs can be taken every day or up to two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants to be included in the trial, including men, women, transgender individuals, and those whose partners are not known to have HIV cases controlled with antiretroviral therapy.
People living in the UK and registered with a general practitioner may also register for potential participation at participating local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England has signed a deal to supply the drugs this week through a proposed international tender.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, administered and administered at large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to a large-scale and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in my thirty years of progress in addressing one of the major health problems of humanity.'
Deborah Gold, chair of the National Aids Trust, said: 'This is a milestone in the fight against HIV.
If it's targeted correctly at those who need it and those who are at risk, PrEP offers the potential to transform the HIV epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high risk for HIV in the UK will have access to a new and powerful tool, through this trial funded by the NHS, that is truly personalized and non-negotiable with a partner, that will lead to the healing of many lives.
We welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority now is to ensure that the trial is rapidly rolled out nationwide and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
With the PrEP trial now available, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'We welcome the start of the PrEP trial, and it has been delayed by months of delays and then government backtracking.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the spread of this life-changing infection.
The trial will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this trial be available nationwide as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in our communities.

Two secrets of death
The daughter of former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51), who was born in Washington, died after falling from the 19th floor of a business center in Istanbul Levent, which is also used as a hotel.
Melis Salihoğlu, a 24-year-old student of Koç University, was also found dead in his home.
It was suggested that Salihoğlu hanged himself.
Investigations have been launched into two mysterious deaths, which occurred in succession and were considered by the police as suicides.
'She was in a depressed state.'
Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, the daughter of Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, who served in the government of Nihat Erim in 1971, was born in Washington in 1966, and she entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on August 1 at 17.00.
An ambulance and police were called to the scene after a Kuwaiti tourist who had moved into a room on the 19th floor and had seen the lifeless body of Chilingiroglu, who had been missing for some time, informed the hotel management.
The medical team determined that Chilingiroglu had fallen from the 19th floor to the hard floor and lost his life.
The mother, Mediha Çilingiroğlu, told the police, "He was depressed recently".
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31.
I have a granddaughter with leukemia, my other daughter.
"This was my granddaughter's care, and she was affected negatively by her illness", she said.
Çilingiroğlu, whose body was taken to the Forensic Medicine Institute, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It's being investigated whether Çilingiroglu was thrown by someone or committed suicide.
The word 'canina' is used
The other suspicious death in Istanbul was that of Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu, 24, a student at Koç University, was found dead in her home.
The girl's father reportedly went to her house near the school, where he was unable to get a message or a cell phone.
The father found his daughter's body in the house.
Melis, who was loved by her family, her immediate community and her friends, allegedly hanged herself in her home.
Melis Salihoğlu's death has devastated his family and loved ones.
Melis was followed by a friend on social media, who wrote, "The sun was shining brightly on our faces".
We had a good time with the green grass under our feet, your best friend Jack and your sister Ishaan chasing that little plastic ball.
"What was the need for death now?"
Living the high life: the loft and clever design tricks have turned this little Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, with a passion for real estate renovation, went from a large house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014 to a smaller one.
It's on the first floor of a flashy Queen Anne-style tavern and a testament to the new design that Joanne was convinced to pack.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-boyfriend in Knightsbridge, in a much larger space", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be worth my money.
I was shown the flat in Earl Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day".
After the initial meeting, the 1,000-square-foot apartment was renovated from the ground up.
Originally a one-room property with a complicated plan, you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom, and Joanne wanted to add a storage area and a hanging floor to take full advantage of the generous ceiling height.
"High ceilings, big windows and lots of wanted light.
This is my run".
To this end, Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed hired Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a suspended floor that you could stand in.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex", he explains.
"We had to arrange the gaps so that they could collapse without the need to bend down on top of each other.
It was not just a simple platform, but the steel would be bent so that it would be at the right height for the function above or below".
This arrangement, with many additional dramas, allowed Erfan to have two full-size rooms on top of each other.
For the hanging floor, the old-style copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the magnificent living space below.
The mirrored gold furniture, the silver accents and the old-style Serge Mouille lighting all define the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of space, space and light.
Mirrors at either end of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirrored guardrail in the kitchen gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
The tracked units provide a hiding place for Joanne's entire forklift and shearing equipment.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more spectacular sense of space, is that you can close the kitchen when it's not in use.
Kitchens open and close, they're not new.
What's unique about this is that it has a garage-style door that can be moved up.
"We used a bit of engineering on this one", explains Erfan, the steel-reinforced polished MDF door.
"It's balanced in weight so it slides really easily when you push the door up".
With the wise use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square feet, an extra bedroom, and an improved seating plan.
"At the end of the day, it's the seat that you sell, or the value of your property", says Erfan.
"As a request, a realtor will enter and make a calculation based on the area of the session".
They've managed to use quality materials that give the space a luxurious look while increasing floor space.
"Materials are objects you touch", says Erfan, "and so they help you to build emotional bonds in the home".
"At home, you don't fall in love with the electrical wires on the wall.
These are important, but they don't move the wires of your heart".
This is proof that through good design and increased square footage, an apartment can be transformed from something standard into something quite magnificent.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens with his bonservis in Beşiktaş
After a month and a half of negotiations, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with the bonus of Lens, which was originally considered a lease.
After a week of intense negotiations, Lens has signed the black-and-white team for a bonus of 5 million euros.
It has been revealed that the Dutch player, who has signed a five-year contract, will receive 2.2 million euros per year.
The Beşiktaş are expected to make an official statement regarding the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
Model Çağla Şikel, who has been in an up-and-down relationship for about 4 years, and actor and singer Emre Altuğ entered the world house in Sortie.
The couple immortalized their wedding ceremony in a photograph, which they called "the most special moment of our lives".
The couple decided to separate after 7 years.
The brothers are fighting over a $500 million real estate empire.
Forty years after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, three doors down from his younger brother Paul, who has taken himself to the High Court over how to divide up property and business assets.
Paul had been trying to get out of the family business since 2014, but there was a fierce debate in the High Court about the break-up.
The brothers, along with their mother, Anna, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was invested in property, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin (described by Paul as "a key driving force and a dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul one-third.
A court filing says that means Colin owns $316 million and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
For Paul, the division of property and cash is a contentious issue.
In his first sworn testimony in court in 2015, he wrote, "The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I have always called the best of properties".
Last Friday, after many failed mediations, the first High Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also fighting over who will control the current business; Paul claims Colin has left him out of the loop.
Colin insists that's not true, but he does accuse Paul of mismanaging some of the properties.
Colin, in his initial affidavit, said he hoped to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority".
The costs of the case are mounting, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and best-in-class lawyers like Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal counsel hired by both sides, recorded by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family who had been running grocery and deli stores since the late 1950s and had bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They pawned their assets to buy the Collingwood estate where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says that he started Westco there "in my final years at the high school, when Paul was a little boy, about 10 years old".
Anna De Lutis herself and Luigi, who died in 2012, say they hoped to leave their property to their sons in a friendly manner.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to be in court", she wrote.
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colin says Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, were "displeased with the terms of their financial separation".
According to the 2015 biography of television star best friend Eddi McGuire, Colin tried to remain unnoticed, despite being a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin just texted back saying, "I can't say any more because the case is in court".
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name into the courts".
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he was trying to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not want Paul and I to fall into the current conflict", he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of a solution".
On Friday, that hope seems to have been lost.
Colin wrote, "Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future".
Trump's new personal secretary is planning to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really can do it.
If so, it'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House special counsel will restrict the flow of information (including news media reports) to President Trump in hopes of holding his boss more steady.
A little something from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"New White House private secretary John F. Kelly, meeting with senior staff on his first day in office, summed up a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump plans to solve with the White House: bad information getting into the hands of the president.
Kelly explained that information had to flow through the staff, whether it was on paper or in briefings, because the president could make better decisions when he was well informed.
Kelly's diagnosis makes a lot of sense, but others have tried to humiliate Trump by controlling the media diet, and failed.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he's still in the White House, watching TV.
A former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February, "If Aday Trump is upset that he's not fairly represented in the media, it was productive to show him that he's fairly represented in persuadable media organizations".
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, "According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit in check was to ensure that his personal media consumption contained a steady stream of praise".
I'll take that.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any given time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't, like that Trump's tweets would be far more provocative if they weren't the ones who intervene.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his men were able to get him out of harm's way a few times, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one could stop Trump from creating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of competing factions, people who were trying to advance their own agenda with material that they were offering to Trump, which could be trusted or untrusted, and people who were promoting their own worldview.
Politico reported in May that throughout this story, advisors have been strategically tending to convey dubious information to the president.
An example, detailed by reporter Shane Goldmacher, was this:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump has reacted angrily to negative press reports, particularly leaks that have had a negative effect, and has been obsessed with finding out where they originated.
That's what happened in late February when someone leaked to the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing his private secretary Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It didn't matter if Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or for providing no concrete evidence or for making false accusations in the past and then turning away from them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff questions about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Private Secretary Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter "attempted to put in place a system that handled and documented the papers that Trump received".
How did that work out?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
He may emerge as a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still in his impulsive state, and his aides are still vying for influence.
These immutable factors will make Kelly's task very difficult.
Crypto FETÖ" has revealed the artists with a special template
Republican Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed the investigation into the "military espionage investigation" and the leakage of information by the secret witness named "Sarmaşık" after the Chief of Staff of the Naval Command, Admiral Cihat Yaycı, said that he was a FETO member.
The investigation highlighted that the Admiral Yaycı was not a member of the organization, but he helped the investigating authority in the decryption of the members of the crypto organization in the Naval Forces Command and played an active role in the fight against FETÖ.
The decision, which noted that Yaycı was tried to be pacified by being handed over to the Navy Command by the order of the so-called emergency administration in the coup attempt on July 15, underlined that Yaycı had given an active fight against FETÖ from the first day of the coup attempt.
In the decision on non-compliance issued by Karakaya, the following statements were used: "It was understood that the publisher worked on the detection of the personnel of the Command of the Marine Forces through a special template for the detection of FETÖ members belonging to the class of crypto confidential services and a special system created from 64 basic criteria and 209 sub-criteria".
It is determined that the prosecution's estimate of the Broadcaster, which is based on a speculative assessment of the broadcaster, which is a known contribution to this direction, cannot be evaluated by our Attorney General's Office, as a result of the fact that the forensic investigations have observed a forward-looking, private and stubborn effort, that there is no evidence about the above mentioned person, except for the affidavit of the secret witness, which is unfounded and unfounded.
Rear Admiral Yayci has been tried before on charges of contempt.
It turns out that the FETÖ is behind this, and the alleged crime is a conspiracy.
Former Air Pilot Kurmay Albay Hakan Dinç, who complained that the archer had insulted him, turned the complaint into a document that was only a note of information, former Adana Incirlik 10.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Tuğgeneral Bekir Ercan Van, former Chief of Staff Adli Advisor Albay Muharrem Köse, former Chief of Staff Intelligence Chief Mustafa Özsoy, former Chief of Staff Erkan Ağın, former Navy Captain Necmettin Aksoy, former Chief of Staff Akif Us, former Chief of Staff Akif Us, former Deputy Chief of Staff Serdar Çamiçi, former Chief of Staff Mustafa Çiçek, former Chief of Staff Almay Mustafa Çiçek, former Chief of Staff FETÖ, former Chief of Staff Mustafa Çiçek, former Chief of Staff Necmettin Aksoy, former Chief of Staff of the Turkish Air Force, former Chief of Staff General Mustafa Çiçek, former Chief of Staff General Mustafa Çiçek, former Chief of Staff General Advocate General Ali Şahin, former Chief of Staff General Mustafa Çamiçi, former Chief of Staff General Staff General Mustafa Çamiçi, former Chief of Staff General Mustafa Çiçek, former Chief of Staff General Advocate General Akif Us, former Chief of Staff General General Staff General Mustafa Önder Çamiçi, former Chief of Staff General Staff General Advocate General Mustafa Çamiç, former Chief of Staff General Staff General Staff General General Mustafa Çamiç Aksoy, former Chief of the Air Force General Staff General Staff General Staff General General General Mustafa Çam Çam Çam Çamlı Çamlı, former Chief of the Turkish Air Force
It was revealed that some of the members of the organization, including the FETO fugitive Tuncay Opçin, targeted Yaycı with their social media posts before and after the coup attempt on July 15.
The traveler has crossed the trench, back to the 'rich quarter'
Some of the wealthiest landlords in the West Midlands are once again in a fight with the determined travellers who have crossed the moat dug by the council to reclaim the area outside their manor.
The travelers parked 20 of their caravans outside Solihull's former street, an area that has been dubbed the 'rich man's neighborhood'.
The council, not afraid to dig a trench to cut their way through, brought horses, babies and a load of carts back after being dismissed in May.
The group, acting with ingenuity, found a gap in the defence, and managed to get their vehicles in by setting up a path through a section that was left unbarricaded.
Angry residents have slammed Solihull Council for being "useless in solving the problem".
An unnamed resident said: "They came there on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones at passers-by.
The council should be ashamed of its actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent away, and now they're back again.
More came last night, and probably more today".
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with the long removal orders to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street and I'm not happy to continue to pay my taxes when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident, who declined to give his name, said: 'Just as a joke, we saw the last group of travelers just leave, and we were immediately overwhelmed by a new group.
The numbers have increased this time, and a horse has even been seen grazing in the parking lot.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unauthorised camp on the Streetsbrook Street estate, and we are taking the necessary legal steps to get them out of there as soon as possible.
To support our evidence-gathering efforts, it is imperative that as many local residents as possible call 101 and report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help to paint a picture of the situation so that the court can take it into account when we present our case to the court.'
Galatasaray has reported the stock exchange on the issue of Ndiaye
According to a statement sent to Borsa Istanbul by Galatasaray Sportif Sınai and Ticari Yatırımlar AŞ, the yellow-and-red club will pay 7 million 500 thousand euros to Osmanlıspor for the player's bonus service fee, 750 thousand if he plays a total of 25 matches in the league, cup and Europe, and 750 thousand if he plays another 50 matches.
Galatasaray will also pay 11 million euros in guarantee fees to Ndiaye, with whom they have signed a four-year contract, amounting to 2 million 750 thousand euros for each year.
Ndiaye will also receive a bonus of €5,000 for every point the yellow-red team gets in the TFF Super League and UEFA matches.
The statement also announced that the player has the right to unilaterally terminate the contract for 18 million euros as of June 15, 2019.
The last day rush!
They've been pouring into fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged by the storm and hail that took place in Istanbul on Thursday.
While many of the drivers who reported the fire were making their announcements to cover the damage by the insurance companies, drivers who had not reported so far were also queuing up for a report.
The drivers who were wearing helmets and didn't report today, came to the fire stations and demanded reports because it was the last day of the reporting period.
Today is the last day
The drivers first had the firefighters take pictures of their vehicles to determine the damage to their vehicles.
The drivers who had their vehicles damaged reported it to the officers.
Hasan Erol came to the fire station for the report, "I have a record and I will take a picture".
It was busy when I arrived.
"There was damage to the windshield", he said.
"We came running to the corner".
We're in the queue.
We took the picture.
"Now we'll wait for the report", he said.
The skyscrapers that wall the sea and the land are breathtaking
CHP MP Nadir Ataman warned that the giant structures rising on the coast could cause an earthquake, saying: "The expert report clearly says that these structures will not withstand an earthquake of magnitude 6".
It is said that the stakes were never dug so deep, with the solid rock 25-30 meters below.
The high-rise hotels and residences that stand between the sea and the land on the coast of Istanbul Ataköy have left the district breathless.
CHP member of Bakırköy Municipality, Nadir Ataman, reacted to the giant projects of shopping malls, hotels and residences that are being built one after another in the district.
Ataman pointed out that the wind resistance of the buildings on the coast is very high.
80 years later, as the city reached a point of understanding, they built giant skyscrapers on wind corridors and changed the climate.
"He's not breathing in the medicine".
Ataman said that the buildings that rise like walls on the coast of Atacoy change the climate balance, and continued: "The temperature is 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers".
These buildings need to be built with the winds in mind.
But our skyscrapers are rising above the windy corridors of Istanbul.
The wind can't get into the county.
These structures are disrupting the balance of natural life.
Ataman said that these skyscrapers, which damage the environment and human health, have also cut off the connection of the people of Bakırköy with the sea, and that they will apply to the relevant Monuments Board and go to court.
There is a non-surgical treatment for hair loss.
Phenol-treated cases have a success rate of 83%.
In this method, diseased tissue is effectively cleared and the tissue space is filled with an agent that kills the hair follicles.
Another non-surgical hair loss treatment is the laser.
Various lasers are used to burn the hair roots and surrounding tissue using circular beams, which cause the tissues to adhere and close during the burn.
These two non-surgical treatments for alopecia areata allow patients to return to social and professional life in a shorter amount of time.
Dr. Mert Atak said that excessive weight, sedentary lifestyle, long sitting, heavy hair and not following the rules of body hair and hygiene causes hair loss. He said that the symptoms of the disease include pain in the tailbone, infection, abscess and swelling.
Italy toughening up NGO approach to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with new rules affecting their operations.
In an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa, Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti said, "If the NGOs do not follow the new regulations, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate".
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat operated by the German charity Jugend Rettet, suspecting its crew of actively cooperating with human traffickers to facilitate illegal migration.
The charity, which has been active for just over a year, refused to comment on the content of the detailed accusations levelled against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
The organization said in a statement on social media: "For us, saving human life is our top priority and will be, so we are very sorry that we cannot work in the search and rescue area at this time".
"We can only assess the charges that are being made now after we have gathered all the information and have been able to assess the situation".
Italian authorities have been watching the Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
The crew is suspected of taking in migrants aboard boats full of rubber boots delivered to them directly by human smugglers and allowing the smugglers to escape in boats to be reused.
According to the prosecutor's files, which were published by Italian media, at least one such encounter allegedly took place 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard, who oversee the rescue operations in the area, for a more humanitarian purpose.
The regulations required that boats like the Iuventa have an Italian police officer on deck, who was clearly watching their activities.
Of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue operations, only three have so far agreed to comply with the statute: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The last of these said on Tuesday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "significant change or impediment" to his own rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescues in recent weeks was an indication that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal security and cooperation with local governors were bearing fruit.
The minister said: "We have recently begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel".
This month, he announced plans to hold more talks with Libyan governors on economic development initiatives and measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe, as well as Chad, Niger and Mali.
The last minute punch!
In the Russian capital of Moscow, the annual celebration of the "day of the paratroopers" was marked with the consumption of watermelon and vodka.
A Russian who participated in the protest and drank too much attacked Nikita Razvozjayev, a Russian NTV TV correspondent who was broadcasting live in Gorki Park.
A reporter reporting on the day's developments on live television suddenly appeared and cursed the man who shouted "We will seize Ukraine". "Please be quiet", he warned.
The drunk man, who was said to be a former paratrooper, gave him a hard punch on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, stunned by the blow, tried to get away from the man.
Millions watched the shocking moment live on television.
The Economic Coordination Council has been convened.
The Economic Coordination Council (ECC) was convened under the chairmanship of Vice Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, who is responsible for the economy.
The first ECK meeting held under Şimşek's chairmanship after the cabinet change in the government started at 18.30 in Çankaya Köşkü.
The meeting will discuss the macroeconomic outlook of Turkey.
The meeting, chaired by Şimşek, was attended by Finance Minister Naci Ağbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labor and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Treasury Minister Osman Çelik, Central Bank President Murat Çetinkaya and related bureaucrats.
You can get rid of a herniated disc in 45 minutes.
Noting that only 5 percent of patients need surgery in the treatment of lumbar hernia, Dr. Oguz Karaeminoğulları says, "According to the results of the examination and imaging of the hospital, the first step is rest and drug treatment".
Oguz Karaeminoğlu, who said that the experimental methods (such as epidural injection, radio frequency techniques, intradermal disc procedures) should be tried in the group of patients with persistent pain, warned that "if all these methods are not successful, if numbness and weakness in the legs become evident, then surgery becomes necessary".
Karaeminoğlu explains that the 'fully closed hip abscess surgery' which minimizes the risk today also allows patients to reduce their hesitation about surgery when they do not get results with experimental methods, explains that it is possible to get rid of the disease in 45 minutes:
Although microscopic surgery and open surgery have relatively good results, there may be some complications after surgery, such as a long recovery period, adhesions to the spine, recurrence of hernia, and possible back dislocation and infection that may develop later.
Microsurgery is often described as 'closed surgery', but microsurgery is often done in the same way as open surgery.
In full-closed lumbar puncture, these risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissue is preserved.
The surgery for a fully closed hip fracture only takes 45 minutes.
The special commission is in session.
The commission will be composed of CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Peace Friend and Turan Aydogan, a member of the Higher Disciplinary Board.
The Commission has decided to publish the report of the Berber Group on 4 October in Istanbul 14.
He will also follow up on the trial in the Serious Crime Court and the appeals to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeal.
In the letter of appointment, signed by the General Secretary of the CHP Kamil Okyay Sındır and the Vice President Bülent Tezcan, "The independent and impartial nature of the judiciary, the absence of any order from outside the law is the indispensable condition of justice".
"Our MP, Mr. Enis Berberoglu, did not demand any special status while performing his parliamentary duties, did not take refuge in the immunity armor recognized by his parliamentary representation, wanted to protect his belief in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary", it was said.
It was argued that the trial process was a case where the court preferred to enforce political orders rather than to try.
The letter argued that the decision to arrest the deputies without a verdict, despite the decisions of the Constitutional Court finding them wrong, is clear evidence that the court had decided under influence.
Michelle Carter was convicted of sending messages that encouraged Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will serve 15 months behind bars and five years of supervised release.
Carter was convicted in June of the murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014, by lethal injection.
Mr. Roy's father said at the hearing Thursday, "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
Although Azami faces a 20-year sentence, his own legal team has argued that both he and Mr. Roy suffer from mental illness.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream-colored blouse, was executed with tearful eyes, hands clasped and eyes on the ground.
The prosecutor told the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy".
She ended his life to heal her own.
He didn't accept responsibility".
"He showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible situation that he regrets entirely".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see "age, level of maturity, or even mental illness as having any significant effect on his actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Mr. Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said: "There is not a day that goes by that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I've come through everything, and I'm trying to be there for her sisters with all the pain we're going to carry forever".
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that the fact that her brother would never attend the wedding or be a nanny to his children "didn't leave her mind".
"The loss of the person you've been with every day since I was born is a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life".
It looks like a lawsuit because there's no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to tell someone to kill themselves.
Carter was 17 when Mr. Roy was found dead in a car in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case had attracted national attention when it emerged that Carter's text messages had encouraged her to end her own life.
When he was on vacation with his family, she sent him a series of messages two weeks before he died, saying, "Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of ways".
In the moments before her suicide, she wrote, "You must do this, Conrad", and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz instructed that he should not be allowed to profit from this case through the press, saying that Carter wanted to attract attention through Mr. Roy's death.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the minority defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a dissenting opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times, saying, "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail".
The dramatic growth forecast from Mehmet Şimşek
Şimşek said that inflation in Turkey should be reduced to low single digits and that food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts that inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his speech, Lightning said:
The next 12 months are critical to reducing uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There is a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope that the uncertainty in our immediate geography will be reduced.
I believe that by reforming a little and increasing our resilience to shocks, we can put Turkey on a growth trend of over 5 percent.
I told you months ago.
Because the worst is over.
And we're slowly shifting our energy away from that, and shifting our energy to reforms that will lead to inclusive growth, jobs.
So the next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, reform, on the other hand, the reduction of uncertainties, there is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, we'll have a little luck and the troubles in our neighborhood will lessen.
Whether we like it or not, a lot of our classical markets are down.
Like Libya, like Iraq.
We're not just losing markets, we're facing a wave of migration of over 3.5 million.
When we look at the last 15 years, despite all these shocks, Turkey grew by 5.7 percent.
Turkey, I mean, we have some fundamental problems.
Now, with some reforms, we can increase our resilience to shocks, and we can further remove some of the question marks in investors' minds, and we can put Turkey back on a growth policy above 5 percent.
I'll be honest, we have such a generous pension system.
I think it's fair to say that our pension companies aren't doing enough.
Once in the car, performance will be strong.
Why? Why?
Because we took precautions.
Companies don't have to go out and spend the effort.
And we've been looking at these concerns, and we've been looking at the poor performance, and we've been thinking about how we're going to allocate global assets to what investment areas.
You know the odds are high.
There's a performance there, in addition to the 25% the state pays for once.
And the rest is in the treasury, which is usually low risk.
Looking at the big picture, I think there's going to be a lot of interest in the coming period.
Because they'll see the performance.
In the other area, there is no failure, there is success.
We restructured BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, 70 billion lire of reserves.
The system has worked.
I have 2.6 million participants in the automatic participation, and I have 775 million lira in savings.
We want a little more effort from the companies.
Let them advertise, let them tell you about this system.
We're working in the off-season.
Maybe if we stretch him a little...
We'll see, we're working on it.
Maybe the citizens will see the return, see the savings, and stay in the system.
38 percent of those who left the system.
Almost half of those who leave are voluntary individual retirees.
You don't want two separate retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You're out of the race.
We were expecting a cut of about 10 percent.
So we're very optimistic there.
For once, the system works.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies are one-sided sometimes.
They raised their premiums too fast.
When we asked what was going on, they said that the court decisions don't take into account the existing regulations.
We just did a clean sweep.
We said, "Do your duty".
They said: "Nay, we will wait for the judgment.
We said, "This is not going to work".
We have a difference of opinion here.
And when that ceiling went to premium, some firms refused.
We made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of high-risk policyholders.
Let me say this, let me say it again.
I prefer to work this system through competition.
I mean, I don't think these ceiling price policies are right, they're forcing us.
I'd like to see this in three dimensions.
The system we've created is to be considered.
Two, the system is working normally, there's a price drop on that trail.
Plus, the burden is heavy, with nearly 30 to 31 pounds of every 100 pounds of premium paid going to tax and SGK deductions.
I'm working on it, too, and we're going to talk to our finance minister.
Third, technology is advancing rapidly.
Now, over time, traffic accidents will also be drastically reduced, structurally.
But this is mandatory traffic insurance.
The cover of "SABAH" saved your leg.
Buerger's disease, which appears from puberty, was once a condition that was seen in men, but now it is commonly seen in women.
One of these women is 36-year-old Mehtap Dursun.
The pain that started two years ago has become chronic in the soles of her feet.
The young woman, who had difficulty walking, was hospitalized after she was at risk of losing her leg.
A friend of his recommended Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
SABAH showed the headline 'Azerbaijan has saved the life of the Minister of Emergency Situations'.
It was then revealed that Dursun, who had gone to Kalko, had been battling Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko has taken the young woman to emergency surgery.
Dursun, who soon recovered from his pain, is now on oxygen therapy.
Audi to modify 850,000 diesel cars as carmakers face backlash
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the BMW board of directors said that the company believes that there are "more smart options than the speed limitations", referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW's headquarters are located (where the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles is being considered).
Daimler said on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms identified these moves as recalls.
European car manufacturers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help offset carbon dioxide emissions.
But nitrous oxide, which is released by diesel engines, is a known carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that automobile companies must wear to neutralize the dirty fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also rising, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive in price.
As German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been accused of pampering powerful car companies and ignoring the root of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of the device known as a decoy and, while a car was being tested, adjusted its emissions to comply with regulations and relaxed it under normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the U.S., and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of Audi's engine development division, the head of thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
The former director, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and therefore not immune from extradition and could be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation that also involved Volkswagen, who expanded their United States-based investigation after authorities accused Audi of rigging a system to get away from European emissions rules.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation could be a heavy blow for Volkswagen: The luxury car maker has an excessive share of Volkswagen's profits.
Don't jump to catch anything you see
The President of the Turkish Nüroservice Association, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, warned against fishing in shallow areas of 2 meters, whose depth is uncertain.
Every year, thousands of people are at risk of stroke from neck fractures and spinal cord injuries caused by diving in shallow water.
Most neck fractures develop in the fifth or sixth vertebrae.
The peculiarity of the fractures is that at this level, they affect the nerves that feed the muscles of the arms and legs, as well as the muscles of the breath.
"In these types of accidents", says Prof. Dr. Chaglar, "the most valuable organ in our body, the cervical spinal region, is cut or compressed by the fractured spine and rendered inoperable".
"Wrong first aid for spinal cord injuries not only increases the damage to the injured but can also lead to death", he said.
Scuba diving is the fourth leading cause of spinal cord injury.
The average age of the injured is between 20 and 29, and the majority are male.
"Fishing should not be done in water where there is no water".
"No matter how well you dive, you could get seriously injured".
Prof. Dr. Çağlar also reminded us:
Paralysis of the arms and legs can occur to varying degrees, depending on the level of spinal cord damage that caused the injury while digging.
You may know how to swim, but the water can be deceiving.
What may seem like a shallow place to you may be.
In the United States and Australia, there has been a 70 percent reduction in shallow-water jumping fisheries due to the placing of warning boards on the beaches.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "In Turkey, although 28 provinces have a coastline, unfortunately, there is not a single warning sign outside of Istanbul".
"In relation to these types of accidents that can be life-threatening, information lights or information boards should be prominently placed on beaches and pools before each summer, under the health directorate, schools and social awareness project of each year", he said.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, Chairman of the Spinal and Peripheral Neurology Surgery Group of the Turkish Society of Neurosurgery, recommended the following:
911 should be the first thing you call at the scene.
The neck should be held as firmly as possible, not moved, fixed with a firm grip.
Airway should be provided and the patient should be reversed to drain the water from the lungs.
It should not be held by the legs and suspended to drain the water.
No attempt should be made to correct the deformity of the patient's neck.
The vertebrae of the neck could be fractured.
However, if the spinal cord is not yet damaged, improper positioning of the neck during first aid and patient transportation can cause fractured bone fragments to press on the spinal cord and cause cut-and-damaged injury.
The lavender of Provence is threatened by climate change
It's become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but it's a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, and this is causing a huge headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and more in autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And there's a little leaf pest, a micro-transporter, and there's a lot of them in very dry weather".
And a lot of things are at stake.
As much as vacationers are attracted to perfume and cosmetics, lavender oil is also in high demand.
Eric Chaisse said: "While there should be very long plant buds with a few broad flowers, we have smaller, poorly developed or nonexistent or weak buds.
So we have less essential oils".
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying a protective mud and water mixture on plants and developing more drought-resistant species.
The journalist's murder underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce meet on Wednesdays to review the latest riots, corrupt officials and plans to cover the endless drug wars that have been unleashed by organized crime in the state of Sinaloa.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedies, they came together to talk about their safety.
They were told it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: to bring their children with them to the office where a hand grenade was planted in 2009, or to leave them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, just perceptions and insider voices.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being linked to the government or the cartels for a salary, a list full of bad guys who make it dangerous to report on the chaos of Mexico.
There are no reports of violence, but the number of dead journalists is rising across the country: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven in seven states so far this year.
Among the latest deaths is Javier Valdez Cardenas, the editor-in-chief and co-founder of Riodoce, a source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", writes Valdez in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere, with a large photograph of Valdez's middle finger, with the word "Justice" written on it, hanging on the facade of Riodoce's building, and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smile, his face with glasses and his Panama hat with a mohawk.
The workshop, which takes place less than two months after his death, is a conversation about the collective trauma, the nightmares, the insomnia, the paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was created in 2010 to handle journalist cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two were prosecuted.
As with many of the thousands of murders that occur every year in drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists rarely face justice.
In Rizeodo, they insist on touching the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken, even though the ground is now more deceptive.
Without knowledge of the killers, without justice, security talks are of little use, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste my time on this study".
"You don't trust anyone unless you know why".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital.
The red Toyota Corolla only managed to drive a few blocks before it was stopped by two men, forcibly removed from the vehicle and shot 12 times, roughly translated as Twelve River, for the name of the newspaper.
The gunman got into his car and drove away, and he hit the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He's left behind a wife and two grown children.
In Culiacan, gossip tends to run free.
But there's almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
After Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the U.S. in January, Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival groups fought to fill the void.
Never mind that every day in Sinaloa, one or more people are shot and killed on the street, or that the cemetery is filled with the mausoleums of drug lords, ornate, double-decked, larger than most houses to live in.
For a moment, forget the "quiet" situation where only one cartel controls the valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Riodoce's co-founder and director, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, a February broadcast featured an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel groups at war with Guzman's sons.
This may have angered the sons of the printing press, as potential gang members bought every copy of the printing press as soon as it was distributed to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper seized with the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican-origin violence against journalists.
He had lived so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was a veteran reporter at Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five colleagues in exposing Riodoce by selling $50 worth of shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on the narcotics issue", Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper gained a reputation for bold and honest news, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish life-altering research without fear of censorship, and readers were drawn to a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to report.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for journalism in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for her courage to persevere wherever the Mexican drug story may lead.
He openly admitted he was scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep living".
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life".
"As a journalist, you must accept your duty, or you will play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death... why didn't you tell me what was happening?'"
The staff at Riodoce misses Valdez, the joker who curses like a mule, his friends who are generous in their hugs and admonitions, his teachers who know how to survive...
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to the bar across the street from his office, El Guayabo, and he always sat at the same table.
Now they ask, has his love for routines gone into decline?
His death forced them to question their assumptions about how best to do their jobs and survive.
"If you're dealing with their women, their children, their clean jobs, the secret airstrips they use to smuggle drugs, they don't like it".
Bojorquez said, "These things were over the line".
The result, even at its best, was a high degree of self-respect and self-preservation.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell something, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, the director of publications at Riodoce, said, "Smell is a feeling that can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier".
He and others say the old rules don't apply in Sinaloa, just as they don't apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials...
The floor is constantly changing.
Suddenly, no cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff meets for security training, and it turns out that spyware sold only to governments has been used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen tried to escape the 104 degrees (40 C) of heat by sheltering themselves in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce's office, which is in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-heartedly, some reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of cops the governor himself said were not trustworthy.
Reporters have been in the mountainous countryside for months, where drug gangs are effectively in control.
In this week's issue, Riodoce reveals three main stories.
Former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was murdered in Sinaloa.
There was also a revelation of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a kidnapping of a group of people at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant, one block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how, so caution was exercised when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew: the restaurant was a hot spot for both drug smugglers and the authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated almost every level of politics in the last century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal, the reporter, asked that "El Chapo" Guzman write about the events that had happened before, including the escape of one of his sons in a military raid.
Just months ago, readers would have looked to Valdez's corner for the best source of information on kidnapping.
Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build, said: "We already knew what was going on before".
"All communication with our sources is now cut off".
While the staff is turning into something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press, Valdez's office is being repurposed as a warehouse for banners and posters protesting the murders of journalists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez went to the show the next morning for a few banners and another reporter at the local D.A.'s office.
Adame Salvador disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was found, and according to DNA tests, officials say it's him.
Journalists across the country have been organizing protests to make their voices heard more loudly by writing "Help for the poor" on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Principal Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Later that day, he asked to be assigned to another job other than government news, feeling that his anger was compromising his neutrality.
Valdez has consistently said that journalists in Mexico are "being exploited" by organized crime, complicit officials, and a careless society.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism", he writes that journalists are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who are in collusion with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and officials.
Ramirez said, "You'll die in Mexico because they want to silence you".
The murders were clearly cold showers.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
His body was found with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my news".
A computer keyboard and headphones, serial next to his severed head.
After the murder of Miroslava Breach, a reporter in the northern border state of Chihuahua, in March, some publications, such as El Norte, chose to shut down.
After the murder of their manager in 2004, others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez had a front-page headline that said to the drug cartels, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their states, even their countries.
This is a tough decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still scouring the streets for danger.
Sometimes, though, they're taken as a reference to photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in a Mexico City apartment with four women in 2015 three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stayed behind and went on, it's a daily dance with these high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once aspired to be a poet, says that reporting the drug trade scared him.
"Mexico is going to hell and that's why I became a reporter".
At midnight on a recent Saturday, as the final issue was being prepared for release, the telephone began ringing simultaneously as the editors of the Riodoce sat outside their offices on the sidewalk drinking beer.
A series of gun battles involving rival gangs and security forces near the coastal resort of Mazatlan has resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised by a series of cartel messages around the area, the war continued to rage.
They put it on Riodoce's website on the sidewalk using their cell phones.
The front page would be changed the next day.
Sirens are going off nearby, there's a gunfight in the area.
Bojorquez quickly glanced at the police officers on duty to see if they were alert.
Even if they were afraid, they wouldn't show it.
Under the gigantic portrait of the founder of his newspapers, his middle finger was on display for all Sinaloa to see, the cadre of Riodoce following in his footsteps.
"How can you think of closing", said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, the intern wanted me to send him out on the street to cover for me?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it's a terrible one.
Researchers have now revealed that the first find of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros, discovered by a Canadian miner, is so well preserved that experts have dubbed it the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could tell that the pul pul pul was reddish brown in color and had a 'problematic past'.
A report in Current Biology described it as 'the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species on earth.'
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived from the mid-Cretaceous period to 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its remarkably well-preserved state has astonished researchers, who describe it as 'really magnificent.'
The plant-eating armored is the best-preserved fossil of its kind, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 while he was digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that looked strange to him in the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil that was recovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years extracting the beast from 2,500 pounds of dirt.
After all this hard work, the finished product is now ready to be presented.
Lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display, said, "If you squint your eyes a little, you can almost believe it's asleep".
'It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur species, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
Examining its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though armored and resembling a walking tank, was likely facing a serious threat from the flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as counter-shadowing, which many modern animals use.
Experts suggest that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, which allowed it to blend in better with its environment and outrun its enemies.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers have now finished their work and named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli, in honor of museum technician Mark Mitchell, who was part of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours laboriously trying to find it.
The species' remarkable preservation has enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the seals and the armor on the body.
They discovered countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the creature's upper body is darker on the underside.
Although contra-shading is common, the findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size far outstrips any contra-shaded animal alive today.
This means that the dinosaur was sufficiently oppressed and hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to hide as a method of survival rather than face it.
But most modern animals that use counter shading (such as deer, zebras, or armadillos) are much smaller and more prone to being a prey, meaning that this nodeor has faced a serious challenge to survive.
'The powerful predation of a large, heavily armoured animal 'shows just how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaur predators could be,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in their fur also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept away into the sea, where it sank back to the ocean surface.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and the rivers and oceans probably extended much further inland than they do now.
"The Nodozor is remarkable in that it is completely covered and protected by a fur coat, and also in that the original shape of the animal is preserved in a three-dimensional way", Brown said.
'And then, the animal looks almost exactly the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you close your eyes a little, you can almost believe that it's asleep.'
The Cretaceous was when giant theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs that stood on two feet, roamed the Earth.
Although he was king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
Among them is the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 ft (11.5 m) long, 6 tonnes (6 short tons) monster.
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was washed out to sea and mummified in mud after it died.
The artifact was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 while he was digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and it's perfect from nose to hip.
The creature averages about 18 feet and weighs up to 3,000 pounds.
Two 20-inch-long horns protruding from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored weed drifted slowly in what is now Western Canada until it was washed out to sea by a torrent of rain.
But the dinosaur's undersea tomb preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular species are so well preserved that bits of skin still cover the convex armor layers along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, a conservation of this degree is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it is.
Fossilised skin fragments still cover the coiled armor layers dotted across the dinosaur's skull.
His right front leg is lying on his side, five fingers up.
I can count the stamps on the bottom of your feet".
Don 't be a whiner when I say I 'll whiten you
White teeth and aesthetic smile are every man's dream.
While people are turning to various ways to whiten their teeth, Nükhet Berk, president of the Oral Laser Applications Association, warns against using products sold in the supermarket or online.
"Whitening teeth can be accomplished by chemicals applied by dentists or by fine porcelain surfaces that adhere to the surface of the teeth like a nail", says Nükhet Berk, who says that such substances scratch the surface of the teeth and stain the teeth so that they can never be recycled.
Berk notes that dental health care prevents the development of many diseases, and that cosmetic practices are important for both dental and gum health and mental health, as well as a beautiful smile, and shares the following information:
Young people's teeth are usually white unless there is a defect in their teeth structure or genetic factors.
Aging, the appearance of dental plaque, and the frequent consumption of cigarettes, abrasives, or dark-colored beverages have caused teeth to darken over the years.
Teeth whitening can be accomplished by chemicals applied by dentists or by thin porcelain surfaces that adhere to the surface of the teeth with minimal or no abrasion.
Teeth should never be whitened with products sold in the market or on the Internet.
Because these materials scratch the surface of the enamel, staining the teeth so that they can never be recycled.
The Municipality of Keçiören has been providing "Home Dental and Oral Health Care" to the elderly, disabled and bed-ridden citizens since 2011.
65-year-old Köksal Güngör, who has been confined to bed for 24 years in the Awakening Quarter of Keçiören, "was informed of this service of the Keçiören Municipality of Eşim".
We called the city, they came right away.
"I am paralyzed from the neck down, and at least I don't neglect my dental care because of this service", he said.
Kezban Gökçe, the 72-year-old daughter of 95-year-old Gülizar Taşçıoğlu, who lives in Pınarbaşı Mahallesi, said: "My mother has been bed-dependent for 7.5 years because of her old age".
When I got to town, I saw the posters for this service and immediately called.
We've been getting this service regularly for four years.
I have problems with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used the phrase "very pleased".
There is no health insurance requirement for the service, which is completely free.
"Küdem" incident in the Turkish army
Dear readers, at the meeting of the Supreme Military Council the day before, very interesting decisions were made, especially regarding the Navy.
This force is commanded by a rear admiral, not a vice admiral.
It's a practice that's almost unheard of in our military.
How did this happen?
The force commander, Admiral Bulent Bostanoğlu, had already served his term and was about to retire...
And it was.
Now the commander was Veysel Kösele, the only vice admiral.
Veysel Pasha, a former victim of the Kumpas and a former prisoner, was supposed to be the commander in the normal senior ranks.
But the government didn't want it.
I'm trying to make it very clear, starting at the top of the Navy, that commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 have not been promoted.
That leaves one admiral in the Navy.
He was supposed to be brought to the empty seat of Admiral Veysel Kösele, the Navy's number two.
And then what happened?
The sixth ranking Rear Admiral Adnan Özbal was appointed to that position by the government.
Now look at that painting!
Rear Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but a lower ranking commander is being appointed in his place!
A senior is being pushed around by a junior.
I wonder what happens next.
An admiral of rank above him does not and cannot serve under a corporal of rank below him.
He doesn't take orders from her.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this agonizing situation, and if he is not retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
And this is the harsh message that the government has given him: "Goodbye, Veysel Pasha!"
As of this writing yesterday, it was widely reported that he had resigned, but the situation had not been officially announced.
Now let's go back to this!
The government has opposed and disliked Veysel Kösele for one reason or another, forced him to resign and replaced him with a sixth-rank admiral, violating our army's traditional concept of "Kidem".
There's definitely politics involved, but we don't know what's going on behind the scenes.
Maybe soon we'll all find out!
Dear readers, I tried to be brief above, especially in the Turkish army, the seniority issue is very important.
Not just as a rank.
For example, an officer who graduated 10th from the School of War is more senior than one who graduated 11th.
The first-rank general is more senior than the second-rank general.
We have seen concrete examples of this in Istiklal Harbi.
Ismet Pasha, commander of the Garp Front...
He has two armies.
Army and the 2nd Army.
It's 1922 and our armies are about to launch a great offensive and drive out the Greek army.
There are some names of value that are expected to be assigned to the army at this stage.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He's offered command of the army, but says, "I'm not a senior officer, I can't take orders from him".
Another name is Yakup Shevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Ataturk's instructor at the Military Academy...
A commander of high rank, whom he loved and respected, whom he called "Hocam", who had participated in various wars.
In 1919, he was captured by the British and exiled to Malta along with other Turkish intellectuals.
On his return home, he is also reluctant to command the army and says the same thing: "The commander of the Western Front is inferior to me, I do not take orders from him".
But Ataturk persuades him to accept the offer and Yakup Shevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
He is the best of the best.
A soldier who talks too much, who criticizes all the time.
A commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and on various fronts.
He's exiled to Malta by the British, escapes from there and comes to Ankara via the Kuşadası.
When offered command of the army, Ali Ihsan Pasha says the same thing: "I cannot fight under the command of Ismet, who is inferior to me"...
But he's being persuaded...
But it seems that after he took office, he was constantly arguing with the Garp Front commander, Ismet Pasha, making things happen and causing the army to be restless...
And shortly before the great siege, he is deposed and retired, and replaced by the bearded Nurettin Pasha.
After that, Ali Ihsan's relationship with Ataturk never improved.
The problem of seniority in the Turkish army is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course he has to.
Veysel Kösele is the latest example.
How did an activist have to find the answer to the question "Who owns the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he arrived in New York City for a visit, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of the Airbnb he had rented and started browsing Facebook on his phone.
It matched the distribution of someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying in the street".
He was surprised to find that no one else had shared this information in the feed, so he turned off Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah pseudonym was constantly being retweeted on his content stream.
A St. Louis-area rapper was live tweeting the death of Michael Brown, 18, who was killed by an unarmed black white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
Brown, who's gonna be there for four hours, has posted a photo of his lifeless body on the street.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is savage".
But death was nothing new to him or his society.
He left his phone on the phone later that evening to return to tweets about the crowd gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were police tape, people screaming, and a man holding a sign that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!" claiming to be Brown's father.
A live video showed a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another officer, he says, pulled the trigger on his rifle and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals".
Ferrell remembered saying, "This is not common".
"'This is not the kind of murder we are used to, and not the kind we would call typical.'
I felt a chill in that moment.
I was angry and I was crying".
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., he picked up his 6-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided to take her to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?" coming to theaters on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, told from the perspective of the people who live in that community and fill the streets with the answers they seek.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with his daughter, who wore a floral dress and wore a tailored crown, they returned that morning to the "talk about the black experience and the black condition" they had repeatedly spoken of.
"Remember when I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe in?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old kid, and it wasn't true.
I couldn't resist buying it", Ferrell said later.
"What is happening here today... is the result of what happened in the past.
He has to know it, see it, and grow into it.
Not only should we be able to advance in the realm of activism and organizing, but we should also know the layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we need to do to liberate ourselves, to liberate ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't have to experience the gross racism in person, she's no different than any other black woman-child.
I feel that I am doing him harm by protecting him from them".
When they got to Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which became a sort of campground for activists, where they waited for the police to come in and talk about the issue, which ultimately resulted in Officer Darren Wilson not being charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter connected with local business owners who made packaged food.
They prepared the bags and helped to deliver them to the protesters.
A new brand of activism was slowly taking shape for Ferrell.
She said that as a student at Missouri State University, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequities in the black community, saying, "My activism has completely changed since 9/11.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It just came out".
Weeks later, Ferrell met with one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, at an evening screening.
Folayan said he and his director, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to "document" what happened.
Ferrell had a question in mind: "Do you want to document it or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was expressed by a multitude of people, mostly white, who came to a community to profit from its pain and its resistance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not concentrated, and we decided to do it differently".
Folayan, a local artist known for his activism on death row, had already contacted co-director Damon Davis.
His involvement inspired Ferrell to the project, as did the other six area residents who made up the "Whose Streets?" team in the years after Brown's shooting.
David said, "This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or speaking to us; we are the ones speaking".
"That was the key to me, how these people would be represented because that's how I would be represented".
Folayan said that while the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, it proved that the film participants were the most vulnerable, as he showed that the movement was "not about a christian leader, but about a community coming together".
So "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, including his love affair and marriage to his wife.
Laughing at the first sight of the finished product, Ferrell said, "I felt like naked".
"But I realized that in doing this work and humanizing black people, there could be a certain amount of sensitivity".
Also, Ferrell's story solidifies and re-centers the role of black lesbian women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who took to social media to spread the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin, identify themselves as gay.
"Black lesbian women in leadership have sustained the movement in general", Ferrell said, "and that's because we've been constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black lesbians have to bear the brunt of it".
Folayan added: "The movement is really being sustained by black women and by many gay black women".
Still, Ferrell insists that "this is nothing like affirmative action" and that he was not elected because of his identities.
"He was the one who set this energy into motion", he says.
"But it's no accident that she's on the front lines, because as a black, gay woman, there's a lot to lose living a life at these intersections.
You can feel his energy on the screen".
By the way, news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but there are still some disturbing racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell's on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home as "a mess".
Yet, Ferguson is still remembering the song he memorized three years ago when he took to the streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Winning is our job.
We should love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round, it's flat!
"The world is not round", Irving told NBC Sports.
The earth is flat.
They're making people afraid of things like that.
Oh, man, that's a lot of questioning.
Because the more information you decode, the more information you get.
This is crazy.
Is the world flat?
Or does it rotate in a circular fashion?
I think you should look into that.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our face.
They're lying to us!
Irving, "For years I believed what I wanted to believe".
I thought the world was round and spinning.
Do you really think we're going around in the solar system?
Nothing they send back.
He's not coming back!
The information they're giving us is too vague.
The truth is here.
You just have to seek that truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is struggling with his Cleveland Cavaliers uniform this season, averaging 24.4 points and 5.9 assists.
A reasonable analogy: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the center of the room at the Friedman Gallery in New York, there are many faces, white, black and brown, dangling from the ceiling wires, each one almost indistinctly resembling the other.
This is a 30-portrait by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, made from earrings and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Former intelligence analyst Manning, who is serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic messages via the WikiLeaks website, reportedly sent his haircut from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Fitting Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her discipline with expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama three days before her term ended.
By algorithmically analyzing the DNA extracted from Manning and creating 30 portraits of what a person with this gene data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg revealed not only the machinability of the DNA data (that there are many ways it can be interpreted and the determinism of interpretations that comes from the essence) but also its identity with a tight, perhaps somewhat cerebral interpretation.
Manning, who was born Edward Bradley but openly identified as a woman in her teens, was convicted in 2013 of 20 felony counts, including six counts under the Espionage Act, computer fraud, and theft.
The image was pressed by the prison so that it had only one photograph: a black and white portrait of Manning, who was apparently restless, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-yellow wig that identified with him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was making a breakthrough with the huge success of her 2012 project, The Stranger Things.
In this, the artist created portraits by sifting through DNA from the waste of legal items like cigarette butts and chewing gum to create a picture of what these people might look like.
Just then, she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some sort of portrait to accompany this piece", explained Dewey-Hagborg at the press preview of the new exhibition.
And he couldn't be visited or photographed, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected correspondents, exchanging many letters over a two-year period.
They even released Repressed Imagery, a comic book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, in which the president forgives Chelsea's sentence and imagines a future in which she can personally see the exhibit.
It was a happy coincidence that Obama actually called for Manning's release a few days after the book came out, which came well after seven harrowing years in a military prison in Kansas.
As Donald Trump finds new, tweetable ways to wage war on government leakers and transgender soldiers and further fuel the sharp divisions he's been asked to fix, there's something deep and powerful about this exhibit that's just being unveiled.
When asked about the odd timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Things happen for a reason".
An artist's statement written on the gallery wall, with Manning's signature in large letters underneath (the "i" in his name is punctuated with a heart), called for an end to "automatic discrimination" based on "gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence: lots of C's, G's and A's written in pencil...
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated science dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to convey how we are all, at least as biological creatures, amazingly similar.
"What I hope people take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open the interpretation of genetic data is, how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, who is exhibiting his 2007 video work, Imitation Memories.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and this is 30 of those stories".
The last piece in the exhibition, which is held in a single room, is a page from the short comic book I mentioned earlier.
Here is Manning, King Kong style, coming out of the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a speaker.
"They win if they silence your conversation".
"So never shut up".
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me".
"I still get tingly hair when I talk about it".
Manning has not yet seen the exhibit in person (as he's quite predictably dreamed of from the cartoon book), but when he does, he'll be greeted by masks, his own genetic imitations, who have gathered like a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything in the exhibit, the genetic haplogroups were written in pencil up to Manning's height, which was specially made.
Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits, "In the past I would put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd".
"I wanted it to be seen as a collective movement, "which was also the movement behind his release, "formed with Chelsea".
Northwestern education officer and Oxford University employee wanted for murder.
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University teaching assistant and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook County records show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for first-degree murder without bail for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged role in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A notice issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officers got a call, got to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple deep cuts on his body.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Vice president for university relations, Alan K. Cubbage, said in an e-mail that Lathem was on administrative leave and banned from Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the proper authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial fellow at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville University said in an e-mailed statement, "We are in contact with the UK police and are ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way they may need".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department Communications Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encouraged the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are intensifying our efforts to locate them", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police had just received a call from the building manager of Grand Plaza who had received a mysterious tip that something was happening in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.
He said the security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
Guglielmi said, "We believe the victim was in a relationship with a faculty member named Latham".
The Grand Plaza management released a statement to residents saying, "Police are still working on the victim's timeline and history and investigating a number of possible domestic assaults".
Italy has seized the German ship
Italian police say the Iuventa, a vessel involved in search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean, was seized yesterday on the island of Lampedusa.
The police, who shared with journalists the recordings of the phone calls, which they claim belonged to two members of the organization, announced that this operation was carried out within the scope of the investigation initiated by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
It is alleged that the members of Jugend Rettet, who are alleged to "operate for illegal migration on the Libya-Italy line", brought refugees directly to Italy from boats of Libyan human traffickers on at least 3 occasions.
The alleged crime was committed by members of the Jugend Rettet, who were questioned by the prosecutor, along with some members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
The statement from the organization said that they were evaluating the charges against them, and that their priority would continue to be saving human lives.
In addition to the ships of the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, around 9 international civil society organisations are involved in the search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had drawn up a 13-point code of conduct for these organizations to follow, and required their signature.
Last minute: 5 of Banli's buffets that attacked Büyükersen were sealed
The five offices rented by retired police officer Mahfuz Banli from TCDD were sealed by Tepebaşı Municipality after the incident of the attack on Eskişehir Mayor Yılmaz Büyükerşen, who was detained by the police and arrested by the court where they were removed.
According to Habertürk, the municipal teams were accompanied by a large number of police and the Metvek Force.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA road map in the short term"
Russian Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to be back in operation, and for the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented.
"A certain stage has been completed in the fulfilment of the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map has been updated in this context", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was reviewing the second part of the WADA Regulatory Compliance Roadmap, which outlines the criteria for the re-opening of RUSADA, recently published on the agency's website.
According to Mutko, this doesn't contain anything that would cause Russia concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future".
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly acknowledge the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Mutko said, "Our anti-doping system admits a failure, but we are investigating.
All precautions have been taken.
But there is no government program and we will not accept something that does not exist".
Mutko's words were echoed by Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission of Russia.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with Russia's anti-doping bodies but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains contradictory positions and regulations.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally", Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA from conducting doping controls in Russia following the doping scandal in November 2005.
However, under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD), planning and coordination of this June test was permitted.
In July, following a visit to the agency's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to get back to work.
100 million people watched it!
The video "Come to Beşiktaş" which announced the transfer of Negredo from Beşiktaş reached 100 million people from 18 countries in a short time.
The video, which is embellished with Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo's dialogue, has been shared on the websites of major newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
The President of Galatasaray will not return empty-handed
Former Galatasaray president Faruk Suren has sharply criticized president Dursun Özbek, who travelled to Bucharest and the capital Ankara for the transfer of Ndiaye to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here's the legendary president's personal explanation for SABAH readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek: "We were finishing when we left".
President Galatasaray does not go away empty-handed, nor does he return empty-handed.
The transfer of Galatasaray president to the player.
The football player comes to the President's feet.
Of course they do, whether they kiss hands or hug...
But whoever the player is, the president won't go for it.
You give 9 million euros to a player that Osmanlıspor bought for 300 thousand euros...
Not 7.5 million, but 9 million with bonuses!
You've already made a big investment, of course you're gonna play it, and 7.5 is going to be 9...
Uzbek's works: I don't want to criticize.
But it's obvious.
G-spot is eroding.
It's not just football, it's all wrong.
It's the High Court and the General Assembly that will change that.
But I understand the members are pleased!
Startups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness at an e-commerce start-up, but the surveys weren't working.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, misleading.
Even if he had pledged anonymity, some of the staff didn't trust him.
"It's never been consistent or objective", says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company in San Francisco that specializes in hair care.
So he called outside help.
A new kind of human resources startup is emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
They're building and licensing software that specifically measures employee engagement, allowing companies to conduct random surveys, target specific teams and demographics, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, allow employees to report a malpractice bypassing senior management and going directly to the board of directors.
"There are now tools that monitor your health like Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Glint, a Redwood City startup that measures employee engagement by software analytics tools.
Errett says that by using Glint, he's better able to understand what his employees are thinking and feeling three years later.
It offers specific teams snapshots and elective polls, and a heat map that shows which departments of the company receive the most complaints and a glimpse of which managers have low approval ratings, so that the reasons for these can be tinkered with.
Companies are beginning to understand that in order to not become the next Uber, they need to be aware of the culture of their workplace, which has been in a state of scandal ever since a former Uber employee described a harassment environment in a blog post where those who speak their minds openly are punished.
For startups like Glint, this need for surveillance means a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity in Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies detect and block misconduct, has increased amid the Uber discrediting controversy earlier this year.
Convercent has close to 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct personalized "subs" surveys, collect real-time, unclassified responses, and extract heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous tip line where employees can report misconduct.
If the president is indicted, complaints go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Covercent, said, "The courtroom has taken control of the organizers".
Quinlan said that if a company is unethical or bad with its employees, it could face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, worker strikes, or lawsuits, even without regulators stepping in.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees, has been using Convercent for over a year to make sure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and provide easy access to the corporate headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, they had to find a phone number or email address for the company's headquarters, file an official complaint, and hope it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's chief legal counsel, said that these are often frightening and disturbing experiences, and that it's not a good way to follow up on employee complaints.
But now, with the company's use of Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers in remote offices, cities, or states (such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay practices) can be detected and resolved much more quickly.
"I can get even closer to this whole, 360-degree view of the employment experience", said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We also protect our shareholders from business lawsuits".
After the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed in 2002 due to ethical violations stemming from the Enron scandal, companies took their ethics, values and employee relations more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after social media came to its senses, companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty laundry from going viral.
"Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy".
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge recurring fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has the endorsement of venture capitalists who support both of these start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing his total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnected nature of companies, their cultures and their venture capital, these investments are not surprising.
Research on the increase in volume shows that today's employees expect more from their workplace than in the past.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just the minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued and giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, LinkedIn's vice president of global benefits and employee experience, who uses both Convercent and Glint, said, "When people are happy to be in a company, feel like their voices are being heard, and feel good about the work they do, they're more committed to making that company succeed".
Investors make money when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when their employees are genuine and feel they belong.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and sense of belonging, it's no surprise that they're finding support.
Having data on employee loyalty is important to workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless unless the company's leaders act.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, it can cause frustration and leave employees feeling disconnected.
Russell Raath, who is the head of consulting at Kotter International, a business management firm, and who has seen the mistake of firms relying too much on data collection, said, "If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 talks".
"Because if you don't follow up, the staff will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I?'"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who did the monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and add communication training to solve problems.
On Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights about its employees, and hopes that in the long run this will translate into being able to retain more workers in this kind of industry where there's a high number of employees coming in and out.
Vitrona said, "If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people".
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose businesses".
The NCAA cancelling two practices every day is a long day for the Bruins.
It's 11 p.m., and a gang of UCLA football players are hanging out for a chat on the edge of the new on-campus practice field.
Some of them are stripped of their uniforms, their backs are sweaty and slippery from the first day of training camp.
For a significant portion of the team, these free moments are their midday break.
After three hours of practice, the players enrolled in summer classes will return to their dorm and work on their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the next morning's meet at 6:30.
Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before he returned to the game on Monday, "The next three days are a nightmare for these guys".
The NCAA's move to cancel two practices a day, designed to ease the burden on players, actually extended their days, at least until the finals on Friday.
So UCLA's first three practices are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players' already busy schedule.
The lack of two practices a day is more than a practice a day; the Bruins are moving the start of camp forward by nearly a week from last season, and during summer school, Mora is training at summer school for the first time in his six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to have 18 practices by August 20th before they begin formal preparations for their opening game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said the NCAA is supporting the rule change even though the players have added new pens to their busy training schedule.
"We put a huge load on them for three or four days, and it's very demanding", Mora said.
"And they've just recently passed this; they're working, great kids.
I think we'll have more time when we get to Saturday, it's gonna be really great".
UCLA will stop training at the end of camp, which is no easy feat considering the luxury hotel Luskin Center is right in sight of their field, which is rained out by the adjacent parking lot and adjacent football and which has a protective net covering the back of the fort.
The Bruins are scheduled to move into the hotel as early as this week, but Mora admits there could be a problem with the vacation of these rooms during the season.
Mora said, "We'll have security".
"It's a real concern, and it's not a big deal to think that someone would rent a room and sit there and videotape a workout.
If you have a training video, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security up in the parking lot at 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan".
Facebook increases the power of verifying stories to combat fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story-checkers and show their findings under original sharing, the world's largest online social network said Thursday as it tries to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on the company's website, it said that they will use updated machine learning to detect possible fraud and send them to story checkers, potentially showing the story check results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points for what many believe to be fake news that influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has become a major political issue in Europe as well, with French voters facing a flood of fake news ahead of the presidential election in May, and Germany backing a plan to impose penalties on social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hateful posts before the elections in September.
In a separate statement in German on Thursday, Facebook said that a test of the new story validation feature was being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sara Su, Facebook's news stream product manager, said in a blog post, "In addition to seeing which stories are being discussed by third-party story validators, people want more resources about what they're reading and sharing to make informed decisions".
He added that Facebook would continue to test the "relevant articles" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic: the story of a castle in England
In its recent history, the tiny Scotney Castle featured in a Squeeze music video and became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, with sweep-edged hair and a penchant for historical documentation, Scotney, who inspired a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman, has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from his comfortable chair in the valley of the River Bewl in Kent.
"I find it fascinating to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years", he says sympathetically.
"What a personal connection to have this letter in my hand".
A Castle in England, stretching from Edwardian times to the Middle Ages, each story documents families who lived in Scotney to be painted by a different artist named from the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote Toothless Men and Other Stories in 2014, a project he found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories in the British Library.
"I was even struck by the fingerprint on the margin of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the King James supporters".
"That was his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of ice because you used to light a fire for the light.
For someone 300 years from now, that smell makes him feel like he's there, too.
Oh, I love the records!"
As a paper lover, getting support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and staying in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I've over-received my warm welcome a little bit".) seems too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" Victorian castle, sifting through archives and studying many treasures and antiques, such as the hyenas' heads mounted on the walls of the mansion and bottles that had been in the trenches for centuries.
He toured the grounds and ruins of the old castle, talking to guards, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on illustrations for his book.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and write".
The National Trust only had full access to the details of Scotney's history when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had just begun to seize the archive, which he describes as "the centuries-old aristocracy saying, 'Oh, throw him in the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the days of the British empire, maps that marked the boundaries of who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a beech tree that the two families were fighting over.
Let it go, people!"
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, use the castle as a jumping-off point for a wider introduction to English history.
"In this book, The Households of the Knights of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of a rebellion in the castle in 1380", says Rhodes.
"The Peasant's Rebellion had begun around here, and I thought a rebellion might be a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the castle's history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral.
The Darrells were Rhodes' favourite Scotney family: "These gentlemen seemed quite a crook, always going into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved debt crises by marrying rich old women; I imagine them as a bunch of handsome men who have a knack for courting female heirs".
With his stint on the street over, Rhodes is looking for more solo writing experience.
In the Finnish wild, he completed a two-week work on a comic about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place in his heart.
"I was sad to be separated", he says.
"Like, 'Oh, now I have to go and face the fucking real world.' "
'Maho' reaction to Meral Akşener
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) General Secretary İsmet Büyükataman has made a written statement regarding the allegations of resignation that have recently appeared in social media and in the press regarding MHP.
He claimed that "the movement was prevented from continuing to exist under the MHP roof after September 12th", using the expression "the movement is prevented from continuing to exist under the MHP" from social media and "some old-fashioned Marxist corners".
When he grew up, he said:
"The Turkish nation cannot digest the historical existence of the Turkish nation, the Turkish nation cannot digest the homeland of the Turk, no matter how much his criminal record is corrupt, his criminal record is puffy, his ideology is confused, his mind is confused, he rubs his hands".
"Now they have resigned" "MHP Kocaeli Gölcük District Organization management and members 410 people and 215 people resigned in Yenişehir district of MHP Bursa".
The public is being misled by unfounded unemployment news like 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
The lies in the newspaper columns are vast, the deception is deep.
There is no resignation in this number, and the number of employees in these places is not more than a handful.
He called the resignations "the word", and said that the polls were "the word" and that the public opinion was being misled and manipulated.
The mayor said, "The propaganda and campaigns of these people to create perception against MHP will be reversed".
MHP Secretary General Boukhataman said that MHP is an important and indispensable actor of Turkish politics and said about the resignations:
The old Marxists are not strong enough to destroy the place that the MHP has acquired in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
Behind all the interpretations, all the methods of perceptual management that are being applied, there is a dirty calculation.
Because politics and media have their eye on the MHP base.
Those who have not done any good work or any good work for the party while they were among us, their resignation now means nothing to us.
What's the matter with people who can't take advantage of our party at their own expense?
The group that has not done good for MHP in their lives, that has not shared our memories, that has not understood our country, that has not joined our struggle, and even if it does, it has always stood aside, its mind has been charred, its heart has been hardened, and it must find another occupation.
Those who cannot stand the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party, their attempts to create a rift, to provoke debate and to create factions are futile.
and it will surely turn on its head.
The Nationalist Movement is the last stronghold of the Turkish nation, which has remained standing despite heavy destruction.
In his statement, Büyükataman called those who claim to target the MHP "political manipulators", "political hoaxers", "the nationalist movement is not without owners".
"The foreign invaders inside, whose roots lie beyond the ocean, "will not achieve their goals, "no matter what the cost.
MHP'li Büyükataman, who used the phrase "Tasmalı traitors will go crazy and turn into ashes in the fire of hypocrisy", put the opposition parties and terrorist organizations together and claimed: "No matter what anyone does, from the CHP to the HDP; from there to Perinçekgiller, from the PKK to FETÖ, they will not be able to carry out the operation of the right of the Turkish nation to own its own destiny".
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of those who plan Turkey without MHP, without MHP; we fought to the end with the bastards who want a government without MHP, a Parliament without MHP.
Now we're gonna ruin the game, ruin the players.
Büyükataman, who said that "the patent of the unity is in MHP", used the following phrases, alluding to Meral Akşener: "As in the film Banker Bilo, an old Yeşilçam production, Maho left the peasants on a mountainside in Istanbul after driving them in the truck for days, saying that I would take them to Germany, it is clear that the resignations of the man they went after will take you to power and leave you on the edge of the abyss".
It's their business, but all we ask of these people is that they be new to where they're going.
Kjaer signed for Sevilla.
Kjaer, who transferred from the yellow-and-blue team to Sevilla for 12.5 million euros and became the most expensive defensive transfer in Spanish team history, signed the official contract.
The Danish star will wear the number 4 jersey in Seville.
A big relief from THY for families with babies
According to the announcement made by THY Press Consulting, the national airline, which puts the comfort and satisfaction of its passengers at the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience.
In this regard, the "baby travel kit", which was developed by studying the needs of babies aged 0-2 years and their families, began to be offered to passengers with babies traveling on intercontinental flights from August.
The kit, which is made with a specially designed bag, includes a changing blanket, a disposable diaper, cooking cream, baby lotion and shampoo, a newborn wet cotton handkerchief and a breast pad.
Products that do not contain parabens, alcohol, dyes or harmful chemicals, and are made with the baby's skin in mind.
Washington is changing the green card rules.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has announced a new U.S. immigration plan that will change the rules on green cards.
It proposes to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do this by changing the way the United States grants green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
"This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates who have the financial resources and skills to benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media.
The writers commented on the Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
I had regained the glory and the glory that I hadn't seen for two seasons, Lady...
A "heartless" team that Aykut Kocaman had brought out in the absences was in the field to make a "stand behind us" agreement with his supporter.
We can bring criticism to the game, to the positions or the performances, but I haven't seen a game that works and looks like that in a long time.
He showed it in the first game, but yesterday he put his own hands on his shoulders, and now Valbuena is the Fenerbahce's commander on the field.
Age was a problem when he was transferred, but Big Man had a "persistent character" in his vocabulary.
30 years ago, we gave the right to name the atomic ant to Risa Çalımbay.
If it works out, it'll be the most fitting comment for the French player.
He was all over the pitch, all over the passing organization, all over the responsibility, and he was a big show for a short guy, scoring a goal.
Alper's leading play and his second forwards position left Sturm Graz's team "restricted" on the field for a long time.
Fenerbahçe was winning the corner, and he was looking for a formula to break through such a hard wall.
They're dominating the ball, but they're not producing any effective passes in the opposing penalty area.
This image may be interpreted as "need a centrifuge", but we're dealing with a player who hesitates to pass to Ahmethan, who can't put the only centrifuge he has in position.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or his performance needs some improvement.
They missed two clean sheets after being 1-1 down.
The passing was important, but to have this fan standing up and cheering the players on for a goal would make the night even better.
There'll probably be one or two new transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahce's greatest need is number 12...
We're on the verge of a very bright and exciting season with this style of play that's got the hearts of those in the stands trying to play.
Aykut Kocaman's machine is drying his gums, he needs a little more time.
They're in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will improve.
And you can see very clearly that the confidence of all the players on the field has increased.
They need that applause last night to turn the page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried.
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder, a new report on technological advances in the sex robot industry is coming out.
I know.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robot Research (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots in the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape, and nail type.
Mr Sharkey said of the new report's release: "People are laughing at them, but the companies are actually quite a lot of fun, and we're going to see more of them".
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with human-like reactions, performed by artificial intelligence, with silicone skin that is warm to the touch, rather than their inflatable counterparts.
Users can also customize their robot to match their blood by choosing everything from the robot's eye color, nipple shape, and nail type or color.
But with so many robots having "personality" that a Stepford Woman is considered innovative, this is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into silicone-skinned robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to personalize their robots according to character traits they find attractive (e.g. shyness).
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including the shy-looking "Frijit Farrah" and the "savage" personality "Wild Wendy".
True Companion's website says, "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as well as it can".
So whatever you like, she likes, whatever you don't like, she doesn't like, and so on.
And they have moods during the day just like real people.
She may be sleepy, willing to talk, or "in full swing".
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots: not only the replacement of real human relationships, but the overly obedient female personality traits, the aggressive urges in Frijit Farah's approach being the most thought-provoking.
On their website, True Companion, Roxxxy is like a vibrator, but with a male vibrator.
"If women can have a vibrator (that's what it says on the text), why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
But these sex robots aren't just a fetish or a sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the optional extension of sexual desire through submission.
Many men will not naturally own sex robots, and while the FRR highlights their growing popularity, they are currently on the fringes of consumer culture.
But leaks from the edges can be highly revealing about the course of the times we live in.
And most people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, with a president who has boasted of sexually assaulting women in the White House.
The most frightening thing about The Handmaid's Tale TV series is not the graphic depictions, the beaded bodies or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like a big change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical resemblance to real women (in terms of porn stars, of course) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human touch and mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personality", robots clearly cannot represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
No activities or back stories, nothing to expose their independence or to break the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they're pleasure slaves.
Or as 2017 would put it, prostitutes.
Attack on American military convoy: there are dead and wounded...
The suicide attack in Karabagh district of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
The explosion, which killed one NATO soldier and three civilians, also left five American soldiers and one interpreter working with NATO forces injured.
In an official statement issued by the NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support), it was stated that the suicide bomber detonated the homemade explosive during a joint patrol mission of the NATO forces with the Afghan National Army.
It was announced that the wounded personnel were being treated at the American Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
The wounded are not in any danger.
Local media is reporting that the suicide bomber is a Taliban member.
The great master of Trump?
To make Mitt Romney look like a symbol of common sense.
The micro-scale family-splitting of political divisions that polarized the American electorate became the reality of the Trump era.
The newspapers around Christmas and Thanksgiving in the United States were full of how to deal with the nightmare of relatives voting for Trump.
We all make an effort to blow up our own filter bubbles.
Less talked about is Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has a bad relationship with our Republican family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Everyone he knows, including his Republican brother, who he's been arguing with for decades about politics and Trump's presence in the White House, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At the dinner table, that's certainly a good thing, but it seems to me that in a broader context, that carries significant risks.
The left was revived by Trump, but the twisting effect of his presidency has given me the right-wing thrust.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrifying possibility that one day his bizarre behavior might no longer shock you.
There's an even more frightening long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who go against his own standards, and they suddenly seem like symbols of logic.
I find myself nostalgic for the odd version of Mitt Romney's craziness these days: the dog in the attic, the 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax returns looked like), both of which are really very minor crimes for Trump.
With Trump gone, the next Republican candidate will only need to be in his right mind to be considered a measurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, the largest carousel run by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and the best three bucks you could spend in the city if you didn't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs in the central cylinder (all clowns and animals making strange faces turned to look in awe from behind their own shoulders) and the music that thunders are strangely exhilarating.
In other words, many of the clichés of a city can be disappointing: the views of tall buildings are beginning to seem dull, the skyline is beginning to seem too familiar to be very exciting, and the city is not as realistic as it might seem.
Thirty-five years on, and I'm still not completely over the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not really a Swiss country house, but a sprawling roundabout in North London.
But the ride in Central Park is still a weirdly magical experience, so two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go there and all have a great time.
If I could grade the rider, I'd grade him right, but thankfully, no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to rate my trading "experience" from 1 to 5 stars before I had to spend my credit card on a bombshell this week.
Same thing at the coffee shop on my block, plus the option to match the note to a 15% tip for what you bought at the counter...
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a fair trade, but to put pressure on the server to personalize an event that is not needed at all.
While the poor woman in the bunkhouse stood up and grinned as if she was sorry, I, in my sickness, gave her five stars for the experience of putting a credit card in her hand.
They put on their baths when the temperature reached 41 degrees
In Tunceli, one of the hottest days of the season, people flocked to the beaches of Munzur.
From midday, as the heat was strong, young and old, men and women, who had entered the beaches along the Munzur River, tried to protect themselves from the heat by bathing in the icy waters.
The beaches along the River Munzur are full, especially because Tunisian citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK spend their holidays in their home countries instead of the Aegean or the Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, who is among those who stayed at Munzur Beach, said that he preferred Tunceli for his holidays instead of the western provinces, saying, "I didn't want to spend my holidays in the west, it was more correct for my family to stay in Munzur, to stay in our own lands".
"The water of Munzur is cold as ice, it's not found anywhere else in the world, it's cooling us in these temperatures".
Hasan Ulu from Germany said that they preferred the banks of the Munzur River in Tunceli to the banks of the Çeşme or Bodrum and that they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to a hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists that prison officials said occurred after he fell in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed a previous manslaughter verdict.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, Steenkamp was shot multiple times at the door of a bathroom cabin in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he had mistaken his girlfriend for a man who had broken into his cabin at night.
The prosecutors announced that they intend to appeal again against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they considered too lenient this time.
The National Prosecutor's Office said it would appeal to the South African High Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces a sentence of 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The first Hajj convoy has been sent
The pilgrim candidates, who will travel to Saudi Arabia with the organization of the Presidency of Religious Affairs, were greeted with prayers and tears at the Atatürk Airport External Lines Departure Terminal.
The ceremony, held at the External Lines Terminal before the first convoy of the hajj, was attended by about 200 pilgrims, as well as their relatives and citizens.
On the other hand, Turkish Airlines (THY) distributed a bouquet of roses to the pilgrim candidates who were going to the holy land by charter plane.
The Hajj convoy in Ankara was dismissed from Esanboga.
The convoy also included the relatives of the martyrs and victims who benefited from the "customary pilgrimage for the martyrs and martyrs" that was implemented for the first time this year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Attempting to Build Illegal Camps
According to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of building illegal camps.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of August 1.
They were released the same day while the investigation was still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
Greek authorities have tightened their controls on free camping and are still imposing harsh penalties on those caught resting in unappropriated areas.
We'll be checking in throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court can impose a fine.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman, 22, went to Turkey with two friends to visit in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who was touring Adana and Mersin in a rented vehicle, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
His friends, who had been with him, were unable to reach Hoffman despite all the calls, and he informed his family in Holland.
While the police were on the lookout for the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald went to Adana.
The nations have been destroyed and the land has been destroyed .
Robin Hoffman, who has applied to the police here, printed missing persons notices for his brother, distributed them in Adana and Mersin.
Robin Hoffman said they last heard from his brother on July 8, "We first contacted the police in the Netherlands".
Then I came to Turkey with two friends and we went to the police.
So far, we haven't received any news, nor have we found any clues.
"We'll stay in Turkey until we hear from him".
Congratulations on the second world to Ayşe Ceren
At the 2017 World Youth Championships in Russia, national athlete Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş was the world runner-up over 400 meters.
Youth and Sports Minister Osman Aşkın Bak congratulated Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş for winning the silver medal with a message.
On the first day of the 2017 World Youth Palette Swimming Championships in Russia, Ceren Yeşilbaş was the world's second swimmer in the 400-meter freestyle.
Ceren, who had a great performance with the 8 finalists, took second place on the podium, missing the gold medal by only 27 points.
The gold medal in the 400 metres was won by Elena Lopatina of Russia with a time of 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal with a time of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by 8 male and 8 female athletes in the championship.
His last words were, "I think I'm dying, bye, mom".
Among the dead in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has now been confirmed to be 30, was a woman who called her mother at the time of the fire and said, "Mom, I don't want to die, it's not fair".
It was explained that the Italian Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend were also present, saying, "Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye".
Among the dozens of people who were unaccounted for after the fire were 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan and her Italian boyfriend, Marco Gottardi, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, said that according to information obtained from the British authorities, it was confirmed that both young men had died.
The lawyer said that the parents of the youths were suffering greatly and asked them not to insist on getting explanations from journalists.
I think I'm going to die. Bye, mom.
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria called her mother, Emanuela Trevisan, on her cell phone shortly after the fire, and that when she heard the last recorded conversation, she too cried.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times in the two hours after the fire, which started around 1:00 a.m. local time.
Trevisan, who was more calm in his first speech, said, "Mom, there's bad things happening here, there's a fire".
We're stuck, we can't get out of here.
There's a little smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to open the door to get out, but there was too much smoke and the elevator was not working", he was quoted as saying.
As the fire grew, Gloria Trevisan's last words were reported to be:
Mom, my whole life is flashing before my eyes.
I think I'm going to die.
I had a life to live, and it's not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hug you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye, mother.
I'm going to heaven now, and I'll help you from there.
It's the fault of the Italian government.
Both architecture students Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi moved to London in March from the Veneto region in the north of the country after struggling to find work after graduating last year.
After finding a job in her home country for only £300, Gloria Trevisan soon found a job in London for £1,800 (about £2,060).
Sandri, the lawyer, said that Gloria Trevisan's family was having a hard time financially, and that "Gloria had gone to London to help her family".
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately", he said.
The drama of Italy failing to provide jobs for its young
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, expressed his anger, saying, "It's our government's fault that our young people are forced to flee abroad to find work".
In Italy, unemployment is 12 percent, and among young people, it's over 40 percent.
As this problem has grown, in the last few years many young Italians have begun to emigrate to many European countries, especially to England.
Last year alone, the number of young people who had to leave Italy because of unemployment exceeded 110,000.
The Italian press commented on the confirmation of the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi, saying it was a tragedy of a country that could not provide jobs for its youth.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can alleviate IBS.
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products may help alleviate symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable medical condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the protein's main amino acid, tryptophan, helps develop immune cells that develop a resilient gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to prevent foodborne germs from sneaking into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote endurance by protecting delicate tissues from damage.
If the balance shifts too much towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, mice that carried a specific bacterium in their intestines were found to have developed a type of immune cell that promoted endurance.
And bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have linked the development of a cell population that promotes resistance to the bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri, a species that is part of the gut microbiome.'
Mice that had more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells.'
If the same thing is happening in humans, L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan could develop a more resilient, less inflammatory gut environment.
While working on a type of immune cell that enhances endurance, postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas discovered that one group of lab mice had this type of cell, but another group of mice of the same species, held in a different location, did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the mice's gut microbiome, or the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were sequenced, and the mice with immune cells had six different types of bacteria, but the mice without them had none.
Mice lacking an intestinal microbiome and not developing this type of immune cell because they were raised in a sterile environment were given L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of this liquid, which was free of bacteria, to immature immune cells taken from mice.
The immune cells have been transformed into cells that promote endurance.
It turns out that the active ingredient is a byproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid, when purified from the liquid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that humans have cells that promote the same endurance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is unknown whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop in humans as they do in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said, "The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage because these cells control inflammation in the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, the high levels of tryptophan in the cases where L. reuteri is present, cause the population to spread".
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a 'dahiye' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have secured a "deal" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40 million transfer from Chelsea began with United's 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in the final pre-season game, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were in the spotlight as they took the forward position to keep the attacking side at bay.
However, Matic, who was ruled out of the Maviler pre-season tour of Asia, had a serious lack of match condition and could only play 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
Mourinho said, "He needs Vakte but his experience, his intelligence, his genius in his way of thinking... he thinks about football".
"We'll help him get ready earlier".
As Mourinho began to shape his first 11 for the start of the season, like Matic, his new transfer partners Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also appeared in the match at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants three more transfers, but the club insists he has already done an "exceptional job" by making three of his four priority transfers.
"I'd like to thank the club for taking three of the four", he added.
"I'd be happier if they got four out of four, but they went to a lot of trouble for me".
Last year, 197 people were hospitalized.
According to the Swedish Social Welfare Foundation, the diagnosis of gender dissatisfaction increased from 1 in 100,000 in 2005 to 8 in 100,000 in 2015.
197 children and adolescents, mostly those who are dissatisfied with their gender, were referred to Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital in the last year.
The increase may be due to a more open society, said Lousise Frisen, a child psychiatrist at the same hospital, who said, "The openness in the psycho-sexual field, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society".
It is well known that gender dysphoria has no connection with sexual orientation.
Drug operation in Izmir
The teams of the Smuggling and Organized Crime Bureau of the Ödemiş County Police Directorate carried out an operation at the house of 36-year-old F.T. on 3 Eylül Mahallesi Ülker Sokak.
During a home search, 33 ecstasy pills and a delicate scale were recovered.
F.T. was caught and taken into custody.
It was recorded that F.T.'s actions in the security will be referred to court.
He was transferred to Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor.
The newest team of the Super League, Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor, has tied the winger Turgut Doğan Şahin to their colors, who wore the November shirt last season.
According to the statement made by the yellow-black club, the 29-year-old winger signed a 2-year contract as part of the transfer studies.
In a statement, "A two-year contract has been signed with winger Turgut Doğan Şahin, who wore the uniform in November.
"Happy birthday to our new Malatyaspor".
A British inventor has implanted a microchip into his home and car with a gesture of his hand
A British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip implanted in him, enabling him to open the front door, access his office, and even operate his car with a single hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, used to have a miniature chip inserted between his thumb and finger, and now offers this service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology, through his company BioTeq.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be performed to medical standards, Winchester went to work with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to the microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also be making changes to locks in homes and cars to make them chip-compatible at a cost of £300 per lock.
The man, who is married and father of a child, has both his house and his BMW Z4 fitted with this technology, and his hands are on the steering wheel, and the car is running.
The White House Show cost the taxpayers thousands
According to military records released to TIME, the White House's decision last month to fly a Marine helicopter over the southern grass for an organization that promotes American manufacturing has cost taxpayers a staggering $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of attention at the July 17th U.S. build program introduction at the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products made in all 50 states.
A Connecticut-made helicopter, a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi were displayed side by side.
According to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Department requested the helicopter's availability by a special order (also called FRAGO) just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern grass for "extraordinary" organization.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an email to his superior, the Deputy Commandant of the Marine Air Corps, the day before the organization, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high-visibility organization".
The message said the helicopter would arrive at the south lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. organization and stay there until the lawn was cleaned between 6 and 9 p.m.
The memo added that if the White House departure was delayed, a second flight crew would be needed for the return flight due to duty time limitations.
The unit's security personnel were inside the aircraft while it was on the ground, while the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the organizing.
It's unclear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violated this provision.
The commander wrote, "One question we asked was whether he had violated the Hatch Act, and we were told he had not".
"Looks like you're locked in", the Deputy Commander said.
Made in America is designated as a formal organization by the White House and is not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even formal organizations have political implications.
The president of the organization noted the ongoing health care reform efforts in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to tighten government regulations.
The use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents are supposed to use these to travel.
But it's unusual for these to be officially requested for use only for a photo opportunity.
Trump came to attention in February when the presidential plane was taken behind the scenes at the first campaign rally in Melbourne Florida, and his Twitter account was filled with messages about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibit, where products made with American materials by American workers from all 50 states are on display", said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary.
The HMX-1 crew frequently makes training flights over the Washington area and rehearses on the south lawn to drop the President of the United States at the White House with a point-blank shot.
While in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, Trump made 58 practice landings at the White House on HMX-1.
An official said the flight for Made in America was part of the aircrew's training needs for that month.
The unit's helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "support duties not related to the presidency".
The White House says taxpayers aren't charged for any other numbers in the organization.
A spokesman for Sikorksky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the south lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost incurred by the organization.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's rate of coverage for the VH-3D is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit logs record the aircraft's flight time as 30 minutes each way from the Marine Corps Air Facility headquarters in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House claims the actual operating cost of the helicopter is far below that rate.
"It is very misleading to impose a cost on taxpayers based on estimates of cost-to-income ratios", said Walters.
"These estimates include sunk costs in personnel, maintenance and annual expenses".
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's expense-reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of the helicopter for this organization.
Spicer said, "The idea here is to show what's made in America this week".
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I suspect that hundreds if not thousands of people are working on this.
And I think we're all very proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that so many Americans, like so many Americans, have worked tirelessly to make.
So of course it's appropriate to highlight this".
It's unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while touring the south lawn for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked with the media about the company's products in his own fleet, and called out Sikorsky's representatives.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the president, "and I have three of them".
President Erdoğan's goal is a joy

Narcon season 3 trailer: The Cali Cartel is back in the spotlight with Pablo Escobar's departure from Netflix's hit series
Despite the emergence of Pablo Escobar's killer in season two, Netflix's series is not coming to an end.
The streaming service has already confirmed the third and fourth seasons, with the first one giving clues about the next season's villains as it picks up the first trailer.
With the third season, the DEA is turning its attention to the world's richest drug smuggler: the Cali Cartel.
They are run by four powerful mob bosses and are run "like a Fortune 500 company", but with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the mastermind, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages the Mexican connections, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is based in New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character who supports American and Colombian law enforcement in the war against drugs.
Other new cast members include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections could be representative if all segments of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, vice president of the BM Relief Mission, says hundreds of women are running for county council, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
In a statement on Wednesday, he said, "The role of women cannot be exaggerated".
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully participating and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban threatened the election process, which coincided with the time when international military operations had turned into a consultative mission.
This year's elections mark the first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to the other.
Haysom said that a strong role for women would contribute to the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of 3.6 million registered voters have registered.

The news reported yesterday that his former adviser, Ari Harov, had "testified against Netanyahu", but no details were given.
The ongoing investigations into Prime Minister Netanyahu include "taking improper payments from businessmen, negotiating with a media boss to publish in his own favor and his name being implicated in corruption on submarines purchased from Germany".
Trabzonspor players have passed the medical check
The club's website said that the players who will start the new season have undergone a medical check.
The statement emphasized that the players were subjected to various tests as part of the health check carried out in a private hospital, noting: "Our players underwent internal, cardiology, eye, orthopedics, general surgery, neurology and ear-nose-throat checks".
In addition to laboratory, radiology and cardiology examinations, the footballers also underwent an echo-effort test.
Their mother went shopping, two children died in the fire
According to the information we have, Sevgi Karakan and Güneş Yapal went to the bazaar to shop.
Sevgi Karakan left her 3-year-old son Hasan Umut Karakan and Güneş Yapal, leaving her 9-year-old son Aykut Yapal, her 4-year-old son Durdu Yapal and her 18-year-old daughter Ummuhan Yapal.
After a while, the house caught fire for reasons that are still unknown.
Ummühan Yapal, who couldn't control the fire, went outside the house and fainted.
The citizens in the area immediately informed the Mersin Metropolitan Municipality Fire Brigade.
Firefighters who arrived at the scene and did extinguishing work inside the house found the bodies of Hasan Umut Karakan, 3 years old, and Durdu Yapal, 4 years old.
At the time of the fire, 9-year-old Aykut Yapal was not at home because he went to the grocery store.
As the families of the dead children suffered a nervous breakdown at the scene, the police launched a wide-ranging investigation into the incident.
GMB's concern about McVitie's investment in the Glasgow plant
A union is seeking assurances from the executives of biscuit maker McVitie's that it will make a long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent on the future of its investment in the Tollcross area.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits among other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said they've invested over £5 million in the area in the last few years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to be informed" if there was a change in their operations.
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland demanded that McVitie's "remove its concerns that funding for the modernisation of its production lines is not being provided".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said, "The lack of clarity from the general manager of Thesis on business needs and the investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply troubling our members.
Generations of families work here and the workforce is concentrated in the Glasgow and suburbs, which is a critical base for adequate employment in an area with a high concentration of local communities and high unemployment and social deprivation.
From a job, salary and welfare perspective, the conditions of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in production, require an urgent need for a fully-fledged manufacturing presence in McVitie's, east end of Glasgow".
A spokeswoman from Pladis said: "The plant manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday and the company will respond directly as we value our commitment to the workers and union representatives.
Two months ago, at Tollcross, we had a regular meeting with the employees and GMB representatives, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We told our employees at the time that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic environment, we were constantly reviewing our operations to stay competitive, which is true of all our businesses and facilities.
He added: "In recent years we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross plant, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross' heritage as a manufacturing facility and the workers and their union representatives will be the first to know if there is any change in our operations at the facility".
Necip and Utku in Beşiktaş for another 4 years
The Beşiktaş club has extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran for 4 years.
On the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), Beşiktaş extended the contract with two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the black-and-white team's infrastructure and made his first professional contract on 19 June 2008, started to wear the A-team's uniform in the 2009-2010 season.
The 1991-born player, who rose to the captaincy, played in a total of 254 official matches in the Beşiktaş uniform.
On the TFF website, it was also reported that Beşiktaş had signed a contract with Utku Yuvakuran, the goalkeeper he had hired last season, until 31 May 2021.
The information on Utku's website shows that he was removed from the temporary transfer status as of 1 August 2017 and that his license was renewed on 2 August.
Utku Yuvakuran played most of the 21 Under Six League matches at Beşiktaş, where he played on loan last season.
The young goalkeeper played only 2 Turkish Cup matches in black and white.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
The La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain won't back down on Neymar after making a £189million release clause offer, but will they warn Barcelona about their world record plunder three years ago?
The sensational bid has set the summer transfer window in motion, with the Ligue 1 side poised to break the world transfer record for more than double the previous amount, which Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for last season for £89 million.
PSG's offer of £500,000 per week after tax, indicates that Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the highest-earning professional athlete when the transfer is complete.
Barcelona are known to be angry at the style of the offer and Neymar's attempt to leave, despite a source close to the Catalans' management insisting that the club has always done its best to keep an eye on him since Santos's arrival in 2013.
And was the world of football warned of this prospect by the president of PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City's Blaise Matuidi expressed interest in signing him in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to all clubs that want to sign one of PSG's best players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will then turn against them, we will contact their players".
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they will suffer the consequences".
Spanish club Barcelona seemed to cross that line earlier this summer when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona are feeling the effects of this interest in their most valuable player, Neymar.
The penalty for preventing the reading of the Sala was broken
The accused, Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yilmaz, who allegedly tried to prevent the imam of the Küçükçekmece Gültepe Mosque, Mustafa Baki, from walking on Ezan and sela, Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yilmaz, were charged with "not joining the organization knowingly and willingly helping", "resisting to not do the task" and "insult" Istanbul 22.
He was tried by the Court of Serious Criminal Cases.
The jury, which decided that the accused Gulşen should be fined 7 thousand lira for abandoning the complaint of the victim for "insulting a public official" and taking into account the manner of the crime, sentenced the accused Yilmaz to 1 year in prison for the crime of "resisting to get the task done", taking into account the importance of the task that the victim was prevented from doing, the public and the future of Turkey in terms of the date and time of the crime.
The committee has decided to convert Yılmaz's prison sentence into a fine of 6 thousand lira.
After two defendants were fined, the defendants' lawyers appealed.
The case is pending before the Istanbul District Court of Justice 23.
He's at the Department of Corrections.
The Chamber, having completed its examination, decided to reject the appeal on the grounds that the punishment imposed on the accused Kenan Gülşen for the crime of "insult" was applied in the legal context, the action was correctly described and it corresponded to the type of crime provided for in the law, and found the punishment imposed on the accused appropriate.
When the accused Nait Yilmaz was reading the selah and met Imam Mustafa Baki who was coming out of the mosque, he was told by the Court of Serious Crimes, "You are not pouring the nation into the street".
The president is taken.
"It's over". The act of walking over and trying to hit the victim, which was considered to be the cause of the victim's imam's failure to read the sentence and the sentence he should have read at certain intervals, led to the creation of the crime of "resistance to not do the task".
The Circuit noted that despite the justification by the local court, the act occurred while the victim was performing his or her duty of reading and informing the public in front of the mosque, and that the victim did not perform any duty, did not perform any public duty, did not commit the crime of attempting to injure the victim due to the public duty he performed, and did not explain how the accused was able to achieve supervision of the victim's attempt to prevent the tasks that the victim would later perform, without sufficient justification.
The circuit stated that the defendant has no previous record, that the victim has not suffered material damage due to the crimes alleged against the defendant, and that the moral damage does not prevent the application of the judgment's explanation and that the application of the sentence is not disputed in the event that the victim has abandoned the complaint.
The Chamber, having considered the appeal claims of the defendant Nait Yilmaz's lawyer on these grounds, decided to invalidate the verdict against the defendant and to return the case to the first-instance court.
Interpol has six Europeans on its list of deadly bombs.
The German newspaper Die Welt reported that Interpol (the International Police Organization) sent a list of 173 names of people with the potential to carry out suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization DEAŞ to the security agencies in European countries last May.
132 people on the list were reportedly from Iraq, North Africa, the Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six of the people on the list were identified as European citizens.
The individuals are said to be from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The suspected DEAŞ contact from Germany is a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine Westphalia.
It was stated that the person went to Egypt first, then Turkey, and finally to Syria in the autumn of 2012.
In mid-July, ISIS announced on its social media accounts that this person had died in Rakhine.
The German Security Agency has not responded to the newspaper's questions on the matter.
It was claimed that the names on Interpol's list were captured in Mosul during operations against Daesh.
According to Die Welt, the American intelligence services examined the list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol reportedly passed the list to police agencies across Europe in May.
Die Welt reported that the German security circles believe that ISIS may be trying to send some of the names on this list to Europe to organize suicide attacks.
