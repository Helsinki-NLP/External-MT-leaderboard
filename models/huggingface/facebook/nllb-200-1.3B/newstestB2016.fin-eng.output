A 9-year-old boy who was on the run in Tampere was found
Police have been on a manhunt for a 9-year-old boy who escaped from Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing person report about a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has been circulating on social media.
The police situation center says that the boy has been contacted and there is no danger to his life or health.
The boy's father told the Evening News at midnight, knowing that the boy had been found.
She's fine, and we're starting the follow-up.
He was found in the vicinity of the house, his father told me.
Ronaldo again in a wild rage - ripped the goal gap to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league over the weekend and continued his exploits in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League title turned out to be, at least for a moment, in the latter's favor.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved into the top of the all-time goalscoring list by himself, when he hit the away Shahtar Donetsk's net with two penalties and one from the field.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80 when Messi, who was tied with him in Barcelona before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have been in a slump in the Italian football league Serie A since the start of the season, but in the Champions League group D, they started strong with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Juventus' Alvaro Morata, ten minutes before the end.
The attack on City was bored by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who had a knee problem.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's league game, didn't come on until the last ten minutes.
Manchester United also suffered a tough defeat in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 defeat.
The away game for 20-year-old ManU quarterback Luke Shaw lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerously-looking slide hit the goal against the attacking ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his ankle.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium for ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but the ManU joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno tied the score before extra time.
PSV's winning goal in the second half was scored by Luciano Narsingh.
The Champions League season began with a goalless draw by Paris Saint-Germain in the A-Division.
It was the Argentine Angel Di Maria who had traded the Manchester United shirt for the PSG shirt.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored in the second half, 2-0 to PSG.
PSG have been voted the best team of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the smaller league clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his starting team Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic started his career at Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team TsSKA of Moscow lost in the B-Block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation . The president made a false speech .
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had a month ago.
President Robert Mugabe has repeatedly delivered the same speech in the parliament of Zimbabwe as he did at the end of last month.
Mugabe, during his 25-minute speech, apparently didn't realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised questions about the 91-year-old Mugabe's mental health.
The main opposition party MDC has demanded Mugabe step down as he is too old to govern.
Mugabe's aides were quick to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe's leadership and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was about China's influence on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria call for an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra EU summit next week to deal with the refugee crisis.
The European Council President, Donald Tusk, who chairs the summits, will assess the request.
The Commission has also proposed that the EU should take measures to ensure that the EU's citizens are protected from the risks of illegal immigration.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
Professor admits on the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend .
University professor Shannon Lamb called the emergency room to ask the police to shake their heads and told them that he had shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared, and the professor said that the contact information for the dead woman's family was on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on white paper that read: "I am very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did. I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me", according to the letter signed by Lamb, according to authorities.
There was no indication in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus, where police found Ethan Schmidt, a history professor who was presumed dead, outside his study, whom Lamb is believed to have shot.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university authorities received a tip about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after this.
We've got one more death to go in the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police caught up with him.
The day after the shooting, students and faculty remained locked behind closed doors, and authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motives.
Researchers were looking into the details at both locations, and the teachers who knew Lamb were telling them about the man, and the researchers were given an image of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students always said they looked forward to the professor's lessons.
According to Gautier police at the scene of Prentiss' death, the professor had no prior history of violence or criminal activity.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned Lamb in his book, in which he had given recognition to the "wonderful people" with whom he had been able to spend his academic life.
Both worked in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which had a teaching staff of 17 people, and many of the students attended courses run by both men.
However, there were signs of problems.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, said that the professor seemed excited and nervous, "as if something were wrong".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 school year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for a medical leave of absence for some medical condition.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's pay policy meant that the dissertation Lamb had worked hard to obtain would not automatically guarantee him an assistant professorship.
University president William LaForge said that he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said that Lamb was clearly troubled.
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, police were able to determine the route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before police caught up with Lamb, he had taken his own life with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of his home in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, said Methel Johnson, a Washington County coroner.
Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
Police were unable to immediately determine why Lamb had gone to this particular house, but Johnson said he believed the man knew the occupants of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started as a teacher of geography and education at a university with 3 500 students.
She got her doctorate in education this spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He was still in high school with his friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried for years to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were in his way", said Hairston, now 40, who lives in Brandon, a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In the emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no record of them being married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house on the riverbank in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Shawn O'Steen, her ex-husband, told me that he and Prentiss divorced 15 years ago, and the couple remained friends, and they have a daughter, who is now 19.
"He was quite upset", O'Steen said of his daughter.
"The daughter and the mother were best friends".
O'Steen had never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they sometimes played together.
O'Steen says his daughter composes and performs her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a lot of companies over the internet.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5th, when Lamb had played guitar and lip harp to a small audience.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"Happy couple", said Shaffer.
"We were joking together.
They both had a good sense of humor".
"The murdered professor Schmidt was the first-year seminarian and specialized in Indian and colonial history", said English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married, and he had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own fraternity and student body.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, there are 900 people gathered for a candlelight memorial service, including faculty, staff, students and local residents.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the evening event, where the university choir performed "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
You're going to be back in class Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back", LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day".
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Mississippi to Cleveland.
Associated Press reporters Emily Wagster and Betrayal in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, with police now saying that Lamb made the 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and they clarified that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us is planning to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not plan to hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the toy and baby retailer says it will offer its current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work overtime.
The company plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country, and in 2014 it employed 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will start this month, and new employees will start in October/December.
With months to go before the holiday season, the shopping season is fast approaching, and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to shop and ship goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future was a defining moment in Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night was also personal.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I noticed that there was an empty seat next to me, and it hit me that Princess Diana was coming to join me", Fox said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
"As the movie began, I realized that the situation was very much like a date with the Princess of Wales.
The documentary Back in Time is a tie-in to the Back to the Future films, and features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely the time travel movie of all time for me", Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be released on VOD and DVD and will be shown in select cinemas starting in October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution to the crisis in Syria
Commenting on Russia's intensified military action, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons are only bringing more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General reiterated his call for all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said he planned to meet the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would be held later this month in conjunction with the UN General Assembly's ministerial meeting.
He also called for the EU to be involved in the negotiations on the Middle East peace process.
The European Union is committed to the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution on the situation of the Syrian Arab Republic.
Chapter 8 of the poll: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trump has been tried for the label of a trash talker.
He's also been called a joke.
Some predict Trump's going to collapse.
Republican circles have (so far) tried every means to pull Trump off the ballot.
Ten of the eleven national polls show double-digit numbers for Donald Trump, and some are already seriously considering what that actually says about the real estate mogul's chances of running.
The election is only in its infancy.
Nowhere has it been announced that Trump will be elected Republican.
Experts point out that around this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was at the top of the ballot, was able to give way to the rising Herman Cain, who ultimately failed to win a statewide primary.
Trump would have a tough time in the general election for a lot of reasons.
External groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth have noticed Trump's strong position and have begun to dig their way into his image to bring him down.
The following recent gallop data show that real estate bubbles cannot be bypassed by the burial of the oval:
There's been a complete turnaround in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University Gallup poll found that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40 percent had a positive view.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten are negative.
These figures are also true in states where elections are held first.
In last week's Quinnipiac poll, 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy with Trump's candidacy.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they were very happy or satisfied with Trump's possible election as president.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson is getting almost as enthusiastic a reception as Trump (43% would be very happy with Carson's candidacy and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
Marco Rubio is third with a corresponding 21% share.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected as their party's nominee.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his arrogance and offensive comments, with 52 percent of Republican supporters nationwide saying the property mogul's qualities are appropriate for the president, according to a poll by ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same is true in Iowa, where the party convention is the first to be held: According to a Quinnipiac poll, 52 percent of Republicans think Trump's personal qualities are appropriate for the Chief of the Defence Staff.
However, according to an ABC and Post poll, 44 percent of Americans think Trump is not capable of doing the job effectively, and six out of 10 think Trump's temperament is unsuitable for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans are asked who is most likely to be chosen as the party's nominee, a CNN and ORC poll shows four out of 10 believe Trump has a chance.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Overall, Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball in their hands.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry was a likely candidate, and only 28 percent thought Mitt Romney was.
The majority seems to think the Trump campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans backed the other candidate, Trump is outpacing almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that the divided camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump's opponents divide among supporters of different candidates.
A Monmouth University poll in early September revealed that in a fictional duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always win a larger majority.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's on par with Ted Cruz.
Is Cruz the only real opponent of Trump?
Ben Carson would take Trump by 19 points in a fictional doubleheader.
A slim majority of Trump supporters say they've already made the decision to vote.
A CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday found that more than half of Trump's supporters are confident in their voting decision.
The situation can change for many reasons, and a confident voter can change his mind at this time.
46% of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's most intense rival right now is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidate are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump's view on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's sweeping speeches will drive important Latin American voters from the Republican ranks and hamper the brand renewal.
However, according to the ABC News and Washington Post polls released Monday, six out of 10 Republicans are on the same page as Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Discontent with the government is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half the Republican vote, and the fact that they both ran as outsiders is a significant boost to their popularity.
Republican forces want a fresh face to run for president instead of a political crutch, according to the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, with six out of 10 Republicans saying the same.
These two candidates are also angry at Washington.
A poll by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the Republican Party's performance in Congress: 54 percent are dissatisfied and 21 percent are on the verge of anger".
Jeremy Corbyn made his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance since the election has been eagerly awaited at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Labour's new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to rise for the first time to show his strength at David Cameron's question time later.
Corbyn will be presenting the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with the media and Labour Party officials watching him with a heavy eye.
Corbyn has called for less theatre and more fact for his weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first time Corbyn's leadership has been put to the test in a context that is now being tested in parliament, following the meeting of the shadow government and Corbyn's speech at the annual meeting of the TUC, the trade union's central organisation, on Tuesday.
The decision by the Labour Party to keep silent during the national anthem at the 75th anniversary of the British Air Force on Tuesday has drawn criticism from several Tory MPs and has made headlines in several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem drew attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he stood during the national anthem, silently honouring the Royal Air Force's heroism in the Battle of Britain.
However, Corbyn's shadow government member Owen Smith told BBC Two's Newsnight that he had urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite the opposition of this monarchy.
The 10 shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing disagreements over economic, defence and foreign affairs, with less than a sixth of the party initially supporting Corbyn's election as party leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant believes that political disagreements over UK EU membership and the government's tightening of the terms of benefits have accumulated in Labour since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn told the TUC meeting that Labour was going to propose changes to remove restrictions altogether.
Hours later, the Shadow Government's Minister for Work and Pensions, Mr Smith, said that the party's position was very clear: it only opposed the government's plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the last decade as Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who has pledged a new approach to politics, says he has chosen the questions to be asked to Cameron from the 30,000 proposals he has received from the public.
Corbyn, of Islington North, said there was too much fighting in the poll, and he promised to avoid clever rhetoric and slang, saying he would instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has stated that Shadow Secretary Angela Eagle is checking on him during interrogation hours, for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that others could occasionally vote, and said he had discussed the matter with the Speaker of the House, Mr John Bercow.
After Corbyn became leader of the party in 2005, Cameron expressed his desire for puppet-style politics, which is often associated with polling hours, but admitted years later that he had failed in his attempt.
Since the first televised interview in 1990, it has been regarded as a key measure of the manager's judgment, control of the lower house and position, but critics say it has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": From homeless to young photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
For a group of former thugs, they've found a meaningful way to learn and make money.
I was shot in Joburg is a non-profit film studio that teaches homeless youth how to take pictures of their hometown and earn money while doing so.
BBC News met a young man who has graduated from the project among the first.

The pound strengthens as UK wages rise
The pound strengthened as wages rose in the UK and SABMiller pushed the FTSE 100 index higher.
In May, wages in the UK rose by 2.9% compared with the same period last year, excluding bonuses.
The faster-than-predicted growth was the fastest since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1% to $1,5505 and the pound also strengthened against the euro to $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1,49% to 6,229.21.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, which gained 20% when it received a preliminary offer from its competitor AB InBevil.
The transaction would bring together the two largest breweries in the world and brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0,9% on the back of the positive results of the competing Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury goods.
The latest sales figures for Richemont are better than forecast, with sales also showing upward trends in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the miner announced his intention to raise $2.5 billion in equity as part of his debt-reduction strategy.
The largest drop was in Mond's shares, which fell by 4,3%, when Goldman Sachs lowered the company's share price for sale.
The JD Sports share price rose by 3,1% after the sports company was informed that its profit before tax would rise by 83% to £46,6 million.
JD Sports boss: Higher payroll could hinder expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the Board of JD Sports, an increase in the UK minimum wage would increase the purchasing power of potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
Cowgill argues that the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grassroots campaign against the Aldi flood
Metcash is seeking to secure its IGA stores from Aldi's takeover of South and Western Australia.
The wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to preserve the market share of IGA retailers in South and Western Australia against Ald's A$700 million invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media and by organising events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign, for example Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers delicious food in IGA stores, and retailers sell regular customers tickets to South Australian Football League matches at discounted prices.
Metcash is expected to publish more details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when the Food, Alcohol and Iron Trading Group will hold its annual Investment Strategy Day.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market for the product concerned in the Union.
South and Western Australian consumers are known for their angular nature, and IGA traders in the region have a significantly higher market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with a market share of 30% in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia, compared to only 14% in the eastern states.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, eating up sales from all operators, but especially from those outside the chains.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail sales could hit $360 million and Metcash sales could hit $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year, reaching sales of $500 million and $600 million in these regions.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume could mean a loss of $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan shows that IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will decline by 3,8% in 2016, 4,1% in 2017 and 2,1% in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14% in 2015 to 10,3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the chief portfolio manager at Magellan Financial Group, told an event in Melbourne that he considered it highly likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglas's comments.
It's understandable that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and the result of Metcash's food business, which serves 1200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% from the 2012 level.
However, the wholesaler is responding by paying over A$150 million a year to match Coles and Woolworths prices for hundreds of products each week, and wants to help retailers to upgrade their stores to increase their freshness and improve their own branded food selection.
According to Metcash's CEO Ian Morrice, the price review and the store renovation plans are in good steam and the company will be able to increase its profit again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
The president of the Australian Tennis Association , Steve Healy , is defending Thanasi Cook .
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves special mention for his behavior rather than criticism.
According to the president of the Australian Tennis Association, Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a casualty in the recent Nick Kyrgios scandal, and he deserves special mention rather than criticism.
The younger of the duo, dubbed "Special K", Kokkinakis, was thrown into the spotlight when bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the ATP tournament in Montreal.
Soon after, in a match between Cook and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate the contestants twice. "Wawrinka should have given up on Kyrgiosis and that guy", Harrison said.
At the U.S. Open, Cook hit the batting cage in frustration as severe cramps ruined his match.
The teenage star is currently in Glasgow, where he will fight with Sam Groth for the singles runner-up behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute", Healy said.
"He broke his bat when he lost the match at the US Open, and he's not the first player to break his bat because of frustration, and I know Thanas well enough that he's not proud of what he's done.
But he has put up with Harrison's provocative behavior at the US Open, for example, very well, and I think he deserves credit.
He's got a great team and a great family around him, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's very mature for 19 years, he works hard and he complements the team well. He's never had any problems with other players and he's respected by the players. He trains hard, he's in good shape and he's a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged on his own merits".
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team in the important round that began as a foundation.Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties.However, he supports the return of the Canberra grower as a long-term reinforcement of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus entirely on the matches rather than the controversies surrounding Kyrgios", Healy said.
Nick has risen quickly, and as Federer and Murray have pointed out, for example, the youngster is growing up in the spotlight, and he deserves the criticism he gets for his bad mistakes, but we're trying to support him so he understands the consequences of his actions, and we're trying to give him peace of mind, and I think that's what's best for the team and for Nick".
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and has been arresting illegal immigrants in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants.
Chaos broke out at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in no-man's land, and the Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to remain in their tents indefinitely on the road between the country checkpoints
Frustration was beginning to surface.
As a police helicopter flew over the migrants, they shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some of them went on a food and drink strike to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Ministry announced that it would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add to the damage.
The situation will be discussed in Brussels in the coming days and also in other countries,' said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The row on the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day later when a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
The Council also called on the Commission to take the necessary measures to ensure that the European Union's policies are implemented in a way that is consistent with the principles of the European Union and the principles of the European Union.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called an extra summit on Tuesday to discuss the migrant crisis on the continent.
Hungary, however, did not look to Brussels or neighbouring countries for quick action.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed to the point that in two southern regions, the authorities were able to use more effective means, such as closing roads and speeding up legal proceedings in asylum cases.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that a fence has been completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners took part in a tender for finishing the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of whom are refugees from Syria and other parts of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that most of the people arriving were refugees for their livelihood, not war refugees with the right to seek asylum, a view which is sharply different from that of other EU countries, including Germany.
In Hungary, a new law, which came into force at midnight, makes it a crime to cross or damage a four-metre-high barbed wire fence erected by the government on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for longer prison terms for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
"We are strictly on the line: illegal border crossing is a crime".
In practice, the Parliament still has to approve the military action, which is expected next week, and Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Orban's internal security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities have caught 45 attempted border crossings at the border and 15 further afield.
The people who have broken the border walls and crossed the border are now in police custody, charged with crimes under the new laws.
The authorities are repairing the fence as quickly as possible.
In addition, Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday, one of which was closed by a barbed-wire railway car.
Chaos ensued at the main border crossing point near Roszk near Hungary when the Hungarians opened a small metal box as a drop-off point where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road between Serbia and Hungary, where people reported being in a food and drink lounge until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's leadership narrowed to Bernie Sanders, according to a national poll.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's approval rating remains double-digit in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders has narrowed the gap.
Clinton now has 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%), with Sanders second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible candidacy for president, and his approval rating among Democrats is 15 percent.
With more than five months to go before the primary, it's too early for most Democrats to say which candidate they're supporting.
But Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since CBS News's poll last month, Clinton has lost support from several Democratic groups, while Sanders' camp has gained new supporters.
Clinton still has a solid lead among women and moderates, but the lead has narrowed.
Clinton's popularity among men has fallen significantly, and he's only five percent ahead of Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership position among Democrats under 50 and is now on par with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a clear lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's lead in the polls over Sanders among the Liberals was double-digit, but now Sanders has taken a five-percent lead over Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats say they'd be happy to support Clinton if she's elected as the party's nominee.
A quarter would support Clinton with the fewest reservations, and 15% would support him just because he's a candidate.
Six percent of the people would not support Clinton.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic supporters even if he were elected.
There's more division in the views among those who don't currently support Clinton, and only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
48 percent of Democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35 percent of Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
When Clinton voters are asked freely to describe why they support her candidacy, the most popular reason is that Clinton has the right experience (16 percent), the second most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13 percent), and the third is that Clinton is the best candidate for the office (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention his connections with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It also mentions the convergence of views and the possibility of winning the elections themselves.
The vice president is still pounding on his possible candidacy, with 57 percent of Democratic voters hoping he'd join the race, while a third would prefer to keep him out of the race.
When you ask Democratic voters who's the second most popular candidate for the party's nomination, a majority of them vote for Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton will increase her lead over Sanders, with Sanders in the race, to 20 points, and that will increase to 30 points if Sanders doesn't go.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the general election, down from 78 percent last month.
Biden, who is second, is a long way from Clinton, but more and more people believe in Biden's chances of winning the election.
But the Democratic voters put the views on issues ahead of the candidates' chances of winning.
Voters do not consider the Democratic nominee or potential nominee to be someone who is impossible to accept.
Voters will find the Democratic candidate or potential candidate suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, reliable, and leaders.
Biden is usually characterized as being honest, whereas Clinton is usually seen as the leader type.
Up to 30% of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, 15% don't think Sanders is honest, 27% can't tell if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters believe the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the ideology of the voters themselves.
All things considered, about a quarter of the people don't have an opinion on Sanders.
When voters are asked about Hillary Clinton's use of her private email and her own server as Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters say they are happy with Clinton's explanation, and it hasn't changed their perception of Clinton.
The American people generally disagree.
Half the American public is unhappy with Clinton's findings, and only a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March, when the conflict had just come to light.
The majority of Americans feel that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall image of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
The majority of this 36 percent, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although voters in their own party consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, there is room for improvement in these qualities when you ask the views of all voters: only 32% consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55 percent of all voters nationwide also do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump both get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates interviewed, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most trustworthy.
The majority thinks Sanders is honest, but like Carson, there's a lot of people who don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The poll is taken from 351 voters, with a margin of error of 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is holding Donald Trump's lead in the national poll.
According to the most recent CBS News and New York Times poll, Ben Carson has overtaken Donald Trump.
These two candidates garnered over half the votes in the new poll, leaving the other candidates far behind.
Trump still enjoys strong support among Republican voters across the country, up from 23 percent in a CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, and 27 percent in a poll released Tuesday.
But Carson's approval ratings have skyrocketed over the same period, from 6 percent to 23 percent.
The poll shows Carson has strong support in every demographic, and in the college-educated group, he's currently beating Trump.
The other candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are far behind, while Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's approval rating is the weakest, dropping from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio shared third place with 6 percent of the vote.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 percent either way, and the poll was conducted in September.
According to the latest CNN/ORC poll released last week, Carson's support is on the rise, with 19 percent of Republicans supporting him, compared to 32 percent for Trump.
Also, in the most recent poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
At a meeting of the men last week, Trump made baseless accusations against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said Saturday while campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the department accused of killing a Baruch College fuc.
Almost two years ago, in the Poconos Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder following the death of a student at a fraternity ritual.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi chapter of Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at his baptism in September 2013.
Authorities said that the victim had his eyes tied, a bag of nearly 50 pounds (15 kg) of sand was placed on his back, and he had been repeatedly attacked as he tried to reach the target, which was located on the other side of the icy field.
Deng is said to have complained of headaches and then passed out.
Police say that the Pi Delta Psi unit members did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they said they waited an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Police Chief Chris Wabner told a news conference that members were able to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact unit president Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide equipment, putting the interests of the party ahead of Michael Deng's health", Wagner said.
Dengi was unable to be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was struck multiple times in the head, upper torso, and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the parish's hookup, with at least one student per year dying from hookups since 1970", says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family.
The municipalities and their members must be held accountable, and the authorities must take an important step.
A grand jury in Monroe County has indicted five members of the congregation on charges of third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the party are being charged with bribery and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to hold accountable not only individuals but also the organization that has officially or unofficially approved the whistle", Wagner told a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the chapter, and the national chapter resigned from the local chapter.
This is how the Fed 's interest rate hike affects the economy .
The interest rate hike and the stock market boom are abating, yields are rising and the economy is slipping into recession.
We know that.
But we don't know how long it will take, or how long the effects will last.
In particular, in the economic sphere, we find evidence of timing in history.
The recession has come as far as 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted as long as 86 months.
The central bank often raises interest rates aggressively, although not always, and the decisive factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why central bank officials have already been strongly stressing that investors should pay attention not to when the rate hikes start but to how long it will take for the situation to normalize.
There are several variables involved, of course.
In the end, however, market participants may find that any manipulation of the rate increase may be exaggerated.
"The first central bank bailout since the global financial crisis was no doubt often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money", Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, told his clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect interest rates to gradually return to a fairly low level, which is a terrifying seismic shock for many.
That does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here are some examples of how the effects can be seen in different sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen for about a month, the prospect of an interest rate hike may add to the volatility for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect isn't so dramatic.
"The trend appears to be a stagnation in capital interest rates after the first increase for 12-24 months, perhaps reflecting a delay in monetary policy, said an analyst at Deutsche Bank in a recent study of the impact of rising interest rates.
Over a period of 35 years, the market will typically see a sharp rise in interest rates at around 14%, a fairly flat 250-day rise (average rise of 2.6%), a normal recovery after 500 days and an average yield of 14.4% after six share transactions, says Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsch, the effect on shares tends to intensify at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest rates start to fall.
The recession is a fact of life, but rising interest rates usually make up for it.
In this case, if the central bank encounters conditions which did not exist before and which could accelerate the downward trend.
Of particular note is the fact that GDP is at an all-time low in view of the central bank's interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950, only twice has the nominal value been below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 looks 3.6 percent, many did not expect it to be sustainable, and it is 1.5 percent in the third quarter, reports the Atlanta Regional Bank.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Member States.
Market participants have been talking about raising the benchmark interest rate for the whole year, and the focus is on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the open market committee approves the raise at this meeting, the futures trade shows only a 25 percent probability.
"In our studies from 1950 to the present, all upward cycles have been supercyclical, with GDP rising very rapidly after the start of the upward cycle, even before the downward cycle", the report states.
The recovery has been very slow compared with the worst recession of the reference period.
The cycle is clearly the longest the central bank has been expecting since the last recession, the record was 35 months, now it's going to be 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been volatile in the run-up to the rate hike, and the pattern is repeated on the capital side.
'The fundamental difference is that the effect is faster on bonds than on shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
For bulk bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately upon the start of the first up/down cycle.
At the end of the upward cycle, the yields immediately fall", Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rate hike will bring long-term and short-term bonds closer together and level the curve.
"High-yield bonds often do better in this environment, even though we are still cautious about yields", said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income securities analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones says the market has already adjusted to the central bank's upcoming change of direction.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adjustment to tightening of monetary policy", Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is flat, credit risk margins have widened and volatility has increased - all typical of a market situation where the central bank is tightening policy.
In general, companies operating mainly in the US market will benefit from lower interest rates and the attractiveness of local products.
The outlook for indebted multinationals is weaker, as the strengthening dollar causes their products to tilt on global markets and debt to tilt.
"History shows that the stock market will be more profitable in the three months following the rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts tell their clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets by an average of five percentage points after the rate increases of 1994, 1999 and 2004.
The companies with high return on capital and the low volatility shares also fared better in terms of lower quality, averaging 4 and 3 percentage points respectively.
"Debt is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable rate debt will lose the most", Goldman said.
Outside the equity markets, consumers also generally benefit from a stronger dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects are visible.
Andrew Bingham, MP: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the station for overpopularizing it.
Bingham said that it is difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitor.
He also claims the BBC Music Awards are just a copy of the Brit Awards.
Damien Collins, MP, accuses The Voice of being impersonal.
A prominent MP said BBC Radio 3 was gradually becoming a copy of Classic FM, adding to the pressure on the station to prove it was offering commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the broadcasting company's radio station was becoming too populist and was hardly distinguishable from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be moving in the direction of Classic FM", Bingham said.
Also at the BBC Music Awards last December, Bingham was criticized for:
"The BBC Music Awards, which were first held last year, seem like a replica of the Brit Awards.
These are two examples of what is already on the market, rather than something new and different", says Bingham.
The BBC's CEO denied the allegations and stated that BBC Radio 3 had far more live music and educational content to offer than its commercial competitor.
"I learned about classical music on Radio 3 that I cannot learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and making music is in a class of its own.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works,' said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, said that the station needed to work even harder to keep the public interested, as the British were becoming more familiar with classical music.
Radio 3 is not the only one to face harsh criticism for entering the commercial channel sector, however, after a limited committee on culture, media and sport heard the BBC's report.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticised the BBC's purchase of The Voice from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22m.
"The programme is hardly discussed, as it is not unique or particularly distinctive".
According to Lord Hall, the BBC1 programme, which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as the judges, was produced in a typical BBC fashion.
Collins also urged the company to look for the hit show from its own label when it next launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins did not agree to rule out further subscriptions to The Voice or the use of taxpayers' money for other entertainment formats.
The slowest growth in online trading in August ever, possibly due to Black Friday.
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce increased by 7%.
Online sales have been recorded since 2000, and last month's growth was the slowest on record.
Online shopping took off three years ago with mobile shopping.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November can curb purchasing.
The decade-long conquest of e-commerce has left many of Britain's shopping streets empty.
According to the experts, there are indications that e-commerce is levelling off and the new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
The growth of total sales in August was the slowest in the history of e-commerce sales, i.e. since 2000, with only a 5% increase last year.
According to the experts, there are indications that e-commerce is levelling off and the new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth with the 2000 figures, it's clear that growth will flatten out over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor-in-chief of IMRG, told the Guardian.
Mulcahy said online shopping picked up speed three years ago when consumers embraced mobile shopping.
"It made it possible for more and more people to buy online, and for many people to buy in a different environment, such as from their home sofa.
If we now moderate mobile purchasing, we can even out growth".
The Black Friday phenomenon originating in the United States is considered one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
Experts say that the last Friday in November can cause consumers to put off making a purchase before Black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online shoppers had their websites shut down.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which makes consumers rush for deals, can curb their buying habits during other times.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that a fair pound for every five pounds was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores.
The Mecca is where the victims of the lift accidents are buried, the family of bin Laden is responsible.
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims through the streets as the first funeral is held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Binladin Group, a large construction company, is partly responsible for the accident.
The Ministry of Health also said 394 people were injured when the elevator collapsed.
Bodies were carried in the air as Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the lift that crashed into the Great Mosque of Mecca
Crowds of people dressed in white had gathered in the streets to bid farewell to the victims on their final journey to Al-Moaissem's cemetery.
The sad scene was a pilgrimage site where a fallen building contractor had just the day before broken through the roof of a mosque onto Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia is demanding that the bin Laden family construction company be held responsible for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims of the lift crash at the Grand Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead when the elevator fell was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents, who were about to begin their annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have promised to hold the Hajj pilgrimage as thousands of people are now arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the lift's boom up when the lift was not in use.
According to the Arabic-language press release, the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English-language news service did not report the details, but the English-language news release said the group's management has been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the collapse of the lift in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where thousands of Muslims will be heading for the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any information on the lifting accident and no representatives of the group have been contacted for an opinion.
The King also accused the group of not having complied with up-to-date safety regulations and of not having cooperated with meteorological experts.
Dozens of elevators surround the Great Mosque of Mecca as part of a giant construction project by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has had close ties to the Saudi ruling family for decades, and the bin Laden family is responsible for several major construction projects.
The late leader of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy who was abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The accident, which occurred amid heavy rain and strong winds, occurred just days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is a duty every able-bodied Muslim must perform at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in hospital.
Authorities ordered a payment of one million riyals (about 250,000 euros) to the families of the victims and to the permanently disabled.
The other injured in the accident will receive half of the compensation.
B&Q boss says cheap Eastern European labour is behind the phenomenon
British people are increasingly hiring housewives, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity of the scheme has been boosted by skilled workers from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores will be opened for workers.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
It is said that the British transferred the hammering and painting of the house to the workers arriving from Eastern Europe.
The skills of hammering and painting seem to be scarce today.
British people are increasingly hiring housekeepers to do household cleaning, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home improvement stores, said that the phenomenon was driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who provide services at the most competitive prices.
As a result of the revelation, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix stores for businessmen, while 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more women to work at B&Q stores, because eight out of 10 shopping decisions at the store are made by women.
At present, the majority of the staff are men.
According to Laury, demographic trends are worth considering, since today more and more single women are also doing home improvements.
"Our stores are still mostly staffed by men", says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process".
Laury is one of five women to lead the FTSE 100 index in the UK and has reorganised the company's management team to include an equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost unique in its kind, with exactly 50% of its staff made up of women, including its CEO and CFO.
"It was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important issue for us", Laury said.
"It hasn't been difficult to find good women on the board".
Kingfisher's six-month profit and sales figures are down, despite the company's hard work following the closure of the stores.
Kingfisher is responding to the current trends: it owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and is planning to open 200 new stores.
The three-axis government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The effects were visible quite quickly.
The sharp decision of the SAK and other wage-earners' organisations was imposed immediately and the result is a nationwide strike on Friday by workers.
And for many, that's also the time to be rational.
We'll ask them if it's worth the strike when it's bad anyway.
There's even a resistance movement.
Over 50,000 people have already gone online to announce that they will not participate in the protest and will go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but to declare oneself rich openly would have been political suicide for a small person.
The protest by a few tens of thousands of people, who are members of millions of trade unions, is not a momentary one, but it does give us something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is not as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's strict solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of seemingly rolling things by themselves, the unions are finally getting down to business, which is to defend the rights of the worker, visibly and properly.
The government may thus be willing to consolidate the role of the labour movement, when union membership may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever one may think of the actions of the organizations, it is ridiculous that the demonstration on Friday should somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 consecutive months.
GDP continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would be on everyone's mind.
The University of Lappeenranta is on a tough savings path: 8.5 million to be saved, 130 staff to be cut
The Technical University of Lappeenranta is launching a savings programme aiming to cut costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start consultations with all staff, with a target of savings of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of approximately 130 employees.
The other activities will be designed to save an additional two million.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the implementation of the budget.
It is also affected by budget cuts by the government.
In the current financial year, the university is running a deficit of approximately 2.6 million.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the Ministry's funding will be reduced by EUR 2 million and the other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the University is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10 per cent of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and a reduction in business funding at our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university press release.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary financing is reflected in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will begin next Tuesday and will last for the six weeks prescribed by law.
General: Onnibus wants to go to Finnish railways
Sir Brian Souter, the British owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, tells Yelle that the company is also aiming for rail services in Finland.
I'm very interested in joining the Finnish railway.
My company, Stagecoach, is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
The railway sector is to be opened up to competition gradually.
The first is the local traffic in the Capital Region in 2017-2018.
After the short haul, it's long haul.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transportation.
The Transport Department says they're very happy with Onnibus' plans.
Among other international companies, at least Transdev (former Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe.
The time of the US central bank's interest rate decision
The world is watching the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible rate hike for the first time in nearly a decade.
A fair half of the economists who believed the central bank would raise rates last week now believe the central bank will maintain the current rate of 0.25%, according to a Reuters poll of 80 economists.
"This is a historic situation, as the central bank has been keeping interest rates at a level that feels like zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus initiate the normalisation of interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought in trillions of dollars of additional money and has only slightly accelerated inflation.
The central bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not so rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications to the contrary.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 8pm CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note .
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning before shooting his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note apologizing for the first murder and hoping to undo it, authorities said Tuesday.
In Gautier, Mississippi, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, Lamb called 911 at about 10:00 a.m.
Monday and said he shot a man.
Lamb called the police to ask them to come to his house.
"I shot my wife last night", Lamb said, adding that there was a friendly dog in the house who was not hurting anyone but was probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he wouldn't tell them.
Lamb also didn't give a motive for the shooting.
Police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, along with a handwritten note from Lamb, which read: "I am very sorry and wish I could undo what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life late Monday when police caught up with him.
University president William LaForge said that he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said that Lamb was clearly troubled.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, but authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of the triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Princess for seven years, described his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years earlier but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's in shock.
He said the daughter and the mother were best friends.
According to the Sun Herald, Prentiss' close friend Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told her about a woman named Lightning, a dog.
"He always wanted to help others", Knowles said.
Police say Lamb called his relatives during Monday and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When police caught up with Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and took his own life.
According to the resume on the university website, Lamb received his Ph.D. in educational psychology from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
The Celestial
The last few years have been difficult for the actor (pictured on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
Everything that's happened has really taken its toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United , for months , for two fractures .
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in the Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will be sad to be sidelined for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal remains optimistic and believes Shaw will return to the field this season.
Shaw, 20, was injured in the PSV's defence by Héctor Moreno in a poor kick in the 15th minute of the game.
Shaw was in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to a hospital.
"Shaw has two broken legs and is in hospital", Van Gaal said.
Shaw's being transferred to Manchester for surgery tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
The youngster, who joined Manchester United at the age of 18, has been through a lot and is now injured after a spectacular game.
They gave Shaw oxygen in the suitcase.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but when he breaks his leg in two places, he's out for six months and won't play in the block.
I hope he's still able to play this season.
Moreno seemed to be on the run when the situation didn't follow a red card to a penalty kick.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal says the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can judge for yourself, but I think it was a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-legged, uncontrollable fight".
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you for all your messages, I can't tell you how devastated I am, my recovery is starting now, and I'm coming back stronger".
More on the subject: Manchester United 's Luke Shaw outscored in PSV
The England defender has a special reason to recover to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very bad injury", said the PSV coach.
"In situations of such injury, all parties are always very sorry.
"The intention of the players is never to harm the opponent".
Moreno broke his leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very sorry because he did not intend to harm his opponent, and it is very sad to hear that the injury is serious", Cocu said.
"I didn't see it myself.
I just saw the ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) was touching the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tackle".
"I know how it feels, I know how difficult a situation like this can be", Moreno told SBS6.
"I feel really bad. I'm really sorry".
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know the Lorax better.
Eventually, any parent will find that a child learns his favorite book almost by heart.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When asked by the Children's Book Council to name his favourite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a 1971 educational environmental story by Dr. Seuss.
In a text posted on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching, creative, and has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there is always an image or message that we haven't noticed before".
Sounds good, except the next section where Cameron is going to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which was added with new characters and details to complement the short introduction.
"In the town of Tarville, where real trees and plants have been lost and even the air is a commodity, there lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by fulfilling this greatest dream: to see a real tree", the text says.
If that's not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the film Lorax, which is on the Internet Movie Database, and it begins: "In a fair town where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, there lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey".
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so foreign to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys trees and makes Tarvikes from them despite the objections of the eponymous character Lorax. The Lorax is a small and thick, mustachioed creature that protects the forest.
Probably, a PR job like this, insignificant in its scope, has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently someone who hasn't read The Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said the text was likely from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further on the matter, but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the England squad, but it's still tough.
The challenge of facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult one, but after seeing the team selected for the tour of England lose the last 3-0 Test series, it is not to be expected to repeat.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but the batting team has good players and the attitude of the team is strong  they don't have bad experiences from 2012, just youthful positivity.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a wicket-keeper, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test-level experience, represents the attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the England Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is obviously difficult for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks against challenging conditions, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricketers are judged by their results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I've said before, players are the best selectors.
A few 50-point games would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance to score more runs for Yorkshire.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he wasn't doing as well as he could have, which doesn't surprise me.
The question of how long a Test batsman gets a chance to make an impression is a difficult one.
Lyth had seven home runs, as did his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play in both home and away games.
The only complaint may be that England first used Jonathan Trot in the Caribbean when Lyth was at his best, but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team, and he's a hitter that I value highly.
He is a cricketer of unknown origin, whom we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season, when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
There's been some talk of Moeen starting the batting with Cook, getting an extra-base hitter in the game while keeping four fast pitchers, and I'm not against that.
I don't see any reason why a top-class batsman can't be batting here, and this left-hander has already proven himself to be a great cricketer.
Moeen may not have done much for his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been a third-striker, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Tests as a first-half substitute before making his debut in 2001.
He scored 300 points straight away, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup pitcher, and from what I've seen of him, he's proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his stats  averaging 31 points as a batter and 35 as a pitcher  and this may be a shot in the arm, but too many pitchers haven't shown themselves ready, and the selectors decided to take a young player.
He's gonna learn a lot on this fight trip.
Outside of the playing squad, England seem to have made a few smart choices for their coaching staff.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan batsman, Mahela Jayawardene, as the advisor for the Test matches may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most gentle men in the game, bringing with him a wealth of experience, having played in all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will be the white ball of the game tour, bringing with him both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he has always made an impact on international cricket, whether in his role as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has a useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it's saying the same thing as the last one, can be a boost.
Colly's team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, has taken a day off from his one-day game, Root got a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Even though not everyone agrees, the coaches and the selectors don't dictate the schedule.
And it must be remembered that, like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions are never made without thinking.
The Brexit camp may win if the economy is in a bad way in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked strategy for the renegotiation of Britain's stay in the EU is getting deeper and deeper every day, even without the "yes or no" vote of the conniving Jeremy Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or the TUC to mock Europe in a roar on Tuesday.
Other countries have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomat recently explained how the EU is caught up in many crises, not all of which are its own doing, and that some Member States are fed up with the British arrogant agenda of divisive concessions and damaging Treaty changes which they do not want.
At the TUC's annual congress in Brighton, it was decided that they too would not be happy in the EU if it undermined social security.
We could call it the Dave and George selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral meetings in the capitals of different countries, snap a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking figures, return home and tell the world they've acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
To my European friend who wants a broad-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin, suggesting that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have reached the point where it no longer matters whether we stay or go.
Angela Merkel, Germany's sensible Chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it is ruined, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Holland of France faces re-election or the choice of a successor in 2017.
His power is also fading.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain may have a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing to help the British selfies, who could have spent their energy better trying to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they don't want to either, because most of them have separatist leanings.
Some of these ministers may be planning to deliberately make useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the 2017 UK general election campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiations were a set-up, and the British had nothing left to negotiate".
Europeans know how the British press is bullying and how the EU-skeptic oligarchic press is, just like Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which was 2:1 for EU membership in 1973.
Perhaps you remember Boris Johnson, the iron-clad Euro-opportunist who became known as "our banana-cross-courier" in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They include tax dodgers, phone hackers, and the so-called "temporary settlers" who own most of our fine newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought about them pretty much the same way, but then he realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to straighten out the bananas to trick them into not eating you for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was the most Blairite in opposing the referendum, and Blair agreed to the EU constitution, which was then rejected.
The press never forgave him for that, either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday, and I told him he had no more time to waste on me, there was a risk that he would adopt Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s, which was a mistake and still is.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dealing with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside of Ukipi and Tory can probably answer yes.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennett" Benn told us on radio and television this week, when her inner scout boy tried not to admit that it was a bad move by Corbyn to appoint the tough John McDonnell as shadow treasurer.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old dad had a hard time being disloyal to his Labour colleagues on television without going too far and losing his seat in the lower house.
Hilary's problems were more interesting.
Mr Benn said he was opposed to remaining in the EU "under any circumstances".
And as much as Corbyn wanted to spread the picture, it's important to remember that he touched even me, and that discipline is important in this 24/7 era, especially in the social media discipline where paranoia and deception are all around.
Mr Cameron does not need to be given a free pass on the EU, which would allow him to take Labour's support for the referendum for granted, as McDonnell has stated.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnell and Corbyn's equivalency on EU membership fits nicely with the insular economy and anti-capitalist past.The debate is no longer confined to a narrow circle of left-wing dissidents, for whom the idea that similarity unites is a key lesson in doctrinal battles.
The European Union is also in a position to take a stand on the issue of the European Union's role in the world economy, and we are in a position to take a stand on the issue of the European Union's role in the world economy.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, they have a dubious electorate, why should they make concessions to Britain when everything could be for nothing?
The United States is already pretty much disappointed in the British military's poor performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cuts made during the Tory government, and I was reminded of that on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize the British government's statements about e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of the state-funded institute that the use of e-cigarettes is 95 percent less harmful than traditional smoking originated at a meeting where 12 participants have links to the tobacco industry.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal criticized the evidence presented in a report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE), the public health authority.
PHE described its report last month as a "transformative and comprehensive review of the results".
However, several researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and have pointed to the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet Medical Journal last month examined the "remarkably hefty basis" on which PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers have pondered in the BMJ whether the claims are based "on rock or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness".
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that the PHE's claim that "e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than conventional cigarettes at the best estimate at present" should be based on detailed analysis and modeling of the results of the study.
The claim stems from one of the 12 meetings convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to consolidate the views of participants on the harm of nicotine products, and to compile the results of the meetings for the study.
According to McKeen and Capewell, supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose previous independent research by the CEO was funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to the sources.
In addition, the CEO's Sustainability Report demonstrated his support for the public health performance of BAT.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting provided funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not provided by that participant.
The selection criteria for the panel are not explained, but there are several well-known proponents of e-cigarettes, some of whom admit their involvement as industry financiers.
However, some participants are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE's tobacco officer.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the study report of the group shows that there is no unambiguous evidence of harmful effects of the products on a wide range of products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, no link or deficiency is mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has so far been presented that e-cigarettes may promote smoking in children or non-smokers.
According to PHE's director of health and well-being, Professor Kevin Fenton, these claims have been answered before.
Fenton says that e-cigarettes are much less harmful than traditional smoking.
One in two people who smoke throughout their lives die from tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of conventional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be studied further.
The PHE is obliged to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, particularly in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the UK, there are almost 80,000 smoking-related deaths each year, and smoking costs public healthcare £2 billion a year.
We must also be aware that the European Union is not a party to the Treaty of Rome, and that the European Union is not a party to the Treaty of Rome.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, formerly the head of Channel 4, has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programmes, including EastEnders and The Voice, and that commercial competitors would give their right hand to hit series such as the soap Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make programmes that other television stations do not.
He criticised the BBC for likely to show programmes with a smaller audience at the same time as competing programmes with a large audience, including on BBC4.
When BBC chief executive Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to increase its collaboration with other organisations, Johnson said he had been trying for six years to get Channel 4 to collaborate with the BBC, to no avail.
"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC buys formats and broadcasts programmes that are clearly part of the software of some competing channel", Johnson told the House of Commons communications committee, which was looking into the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep a broadcasting licence, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should at least restrict its offer to programmes which are not produced and bought by others.
The BBC is sending The Voice to its best viewing time, because it wants as much support as possible in the future.
If no other channel is running the show, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidies", Johnson said.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders is another, even though it's their own production.
A lot of people on the network would give their right hand for that.
I don't see how this is serving the broadcasting industry.
I don't think these would be losses for the BBC".
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, believes the BBC is keen on good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and believes it is the best way to ensure long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are in line with former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC sell off series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC's niche programming is shown on BBC4, where viewership is often unmeasurable, but the programming serves its purpose. "The BBC can say that in defending its hypocritical missions of £4 billion in broadcasting fees, it did do some extraordinary programming that nobody watched".
"The BBC shows them at times when no one ever sees them".
Regarding public broadcasting, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system that is as old-fashioned as the one that benefits the most.
Of course, everyone thinks £150 a year is cheap, but it's a lot of money for people who don't watch the BBC".
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also gave his views to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should switch from its old mission to the new one of "information, education and entertainment".
According to Elstein, the BBC's current offer of educational programmes is barely 1 percent on television and 0.1 percent on radio, adding that the BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian broadcasters and embrace a new faith in its mission: "to inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the issue of cooperation, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts of events such as the Proms, which only a fraction of its concerts last year. "The BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to make the whole range available online", he continues.
The brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
This video shows how the shuttle worm changes direction when you apply ultrasound to it.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems so that they can be controlled by ultrasound.
The tiny shuttle tubes change direction when subjected to ultrasound at frequencies above the range of hearing in the human ear.
Sound waves activate motor neurons, which have been genetically engineered to have a transport membrane that responds to ultrasound.
Read more: Scientists monitor brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms were able to demonstrate the efficacy of a new method of sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells by means of an external stimulus.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method may one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS), an invasive method used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, in which the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
Although shuttle bugs do not normally respond to ultrasound, Chalasani noticed that the worms do react when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
Chalasani says the bubbles amplify ultrasound waves that travel into the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the cell membranes of worms.
According to an article in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To control the shuttle worms with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically engineered the worms so that some of the nerves that control their movement would appear as TRP4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed to the modified mats, the microwave waves amplified and passed into the mats, triggering a signal in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows scientists to activate nerve cells with light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is the brain that is being studied, and light is being directed to the brain by means of light fibers, but low-frequency ultrasound is easily penetrating the cell, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that through gene therapy and viral therapy, human nerve cells can be exposed to ultrasound signals for a moment in a clinical setting in certain neurological treatments", said Chalasani.
He said that the method could also be applied to muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices on your doorstep!
The ads are a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Watch this video from Amnesty International's anti-gun rally.
The most charismatic of all the missile-killers!
The ankle-breaking cars!
The bombs!
Remote sensors that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The video, produced by Amnesty International, is designed to highlight the British government's attempts to sell arms to repressive governments at the Defence Security and Equipment International (DSEI) trade fairs, which are held at the ExCel Exhibition Centre in London's Docklands.
More on the subject: DSEI stations: authoritarian governments arrive in London
Bus stops and subway trains are also plastered with signs that demand a second look.
"Important notice: are you on the subway on 15 September 18?" The notice looks like a London Underground notice, with a picture of a tanker at the end of the subway line on the second row.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands, asking customers for help in dismantling the stations".
Three hundred posters were made by artists whose work was on display at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with a six-pound "advertising hacking kit" containing six-colored keys that claim to give access to about a third of the world's bus station billboards.
Transport for London is not laughing at the vandalism of posters.
One of the Special Patrol Group collective's commercials.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator at Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public's view outside of galleries.
Artists have found that social impact through art requires bringing art into the real world, and many have moved on to work with activists in protest movements.
One of the anti-gun posters greets the public transport in the subway.
The video of Amnesty has been viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours, and was designed by the VCCP advertising agency, which has both the graphic designer and the co-author doing the work for free.
Matt Lever, the art director of VCCP, was puzzled by the absence of a trade show ad and the blank space in the ExCeL calendar of events, and he said, "Give them a campaign they're trying to avoid".
They were trying to make a more realistic, dark-colored corporate video, but the bright colors and animation are more attention-grabbing".
"They have done a fantastic job and helped us to bring to light the trade fairs where illegal trade in torture is being practiced", says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
"Now the government must act and ensure that torture equipment is not trafficked illegally right on our doorstep".
However, the donation of the seeds is perhaps on display in the ExCeL exhibition halls themselves, where the exhibitors exploit the spectacular turnover of their merchandise.
In its press release, Saab announced an order from the US Army for a 'portable AT4CS RS'.
The product includes a 'specifically designed warhead which penetrates directly into the target with great efficiency'.
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for student housing
I moved into the dorm 11 years ago, and I was an innocent 19-year-old girl who still believed in the barrette and moral relativism, and it's only now that I remember the violent smiles of those I irritated and the countless, long complaints of others.
I can summarize the most important lessons in eight simple rules.
Moving into a new home is a stressful experience at best and a shocking one at worst.
It's easy to get into a bit of a chatterbox, telling everyone where you are, whether you liked the break and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite, because it's just a yeast infection, a hashish, I'm in my room".
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe: show interest and ask questions.
Asking guides the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even when your eyelashes were on fire and these people were handing out switches.
Give the others some room.
A private room often serves as a drinking fountain, a movie theater, and a common living space, but a private room is also a place to dress, starting with your underwear.
More on the topic: Don't even think about combining dating and college
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your own room should be a place for relaxation, but many residences are developing a social culture of moving from room to room and forming lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return to.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I spent dating you".
Try to see if any of your schoolmates are tired of social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text message instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
In my own dorm room, there was this guy who thought that if the door wasn't locked, it meant he was welcome in.
He saw things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies properly when baking is in, so if you're baking brownies and you knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-year-old, a little bit of a weird case of, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you a little something. Smile while I whisper personal details to you".
I think homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your friends at school will have to talk to you, and a tasty surprise might leave a positive impression on them.
Of course, this will require you to have reasonable baking skills.
If you serve unhappy cooks with flour, sugar, and fat, they'll probably pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Food spiking is also a common violation in student housing.
Stealing another chicken is stealing, of course, but can you spill a drop of tea from someone else's milk carton?
Always check with the milk carton owner.
You'll probably get a pass, even if the milk loan would be a slap on the wrist for the owner of the tin.
I understand how annoying it is when someone tells you something, but try to handle it as adultly as possible, unlike my friend at school, who used to pour detergent into his milk as punishment for milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Don't make a noise when others try to sleep or sleep.
Not only is that polite, but it's also worth remembering that every man digging a hole for another...
In my own apartment, a girl asked the next-door neighbor to turn the music down because it was 3:00 in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
The neighbor just added volume.
When I finally got quiet in the next room, she let the neighbor sleep for two hours, she went to the test for three hours, left the music playing in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse just happened to move into the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you thought your college boyfriend was your future husband, started dating, broke up, and had to see him every day, losing the right to see him from your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the person you're dating at school is definitely not the one, try to control your desire.
If you notice in a moment of carelessness that someone has left his keys in a room whose door is not locked, the line between teasing and bullying is more elusive than you might think.
A good joke is fun, but it's one that you recover from in a second.
Hiding an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one should be smearing their room with toothpaste and shampoo.
The door of the other room may be locked and the keys dropped into a glass of water, which is placed in the freezer, but do not fasten anyone's belongings to the ceiling with a blue ribbon more than a couple of times.
Racial attack on the hostel of foreign students in Kite, house planned as a reception center was destroyed in Salo
A racist attack on the hostel of foreign students took place on Saturday morning in Kite, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police had previously said, the accommodation is not for underage asylum seekers but for foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Kitee Evangelical Folk School.
The windows and walls of the public school's dormitories were strewn with racist signs, such as hook-and-loop crosses, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one dormitory, Eastern Finland police said.
Luukkainen, who is responsible for social security education for young people at the National University, said that there were an estimated ten people in the building that was the target of the violence at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move around, so some of it could be elsewhere", says Luukkainen.
The National School is home to people of 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minors seeking asylum.
Everyone in the messed-up building has an A-status.
Some are studying in adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish", Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an accident and a breach of the peace.
Luukkainen said that an information session was held for the students on Monday, with the necessary interpreters present.
There's no panic here, and no one's wanted to leave.
We've had foreign students for twelve years, and this is the first time something like this has happened", Luukkainen says.
According to Bones, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men, and they were driving a white car.
I think this is a weekend-night puzzle for young people, now that this topic has been brought up.
Nothing more serious than that", says Bone.
The hall also houses a hospital with a planned reception centre.
It happened last week.
MTV reported it on their website Tuesday night.
There was a cross on the hospital wall with the words "You are not welcome" written in English.
There's a police report.
Correction 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is stopping the Y-train for Karya, passengers in a frenzy, "just idiotic".
The Y train from Helsinki to Raaseporin Karja will stop running in March.
The news upset passengers boarding the train at the Helsinki Central Station.
The lowest rate of inflation is particularly striking the Sienese, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident of the municipality.
It is absolutely ridiculous, because the population is growing all the time and the people who are working need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot be anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in the HSTV interview video that he's coming to the capital on a tractor.
There are also changes taking place elsewhere in the New World.
The H and R trains running on the main line will be combined into a new R line.
The Purola station at Lakehead and the Nuppulinna station at Tuusula will be decommissioned.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR on Tuesday announced the information on which routes the Ministry will buy train services for the next contract period.
The contract period varies from year to year and there are cancellations throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, to be finalised in the autumn, will be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee at a later date.
Mr Bengtström, a member of the Sionians, considers the state railway company to be a short-sighted activity.
We're going to make the same mistakes that we've made before and we're going to repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then you feel sorry for yourself.
The Y-train is also used by people other than the Greeks and the Sicilians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyrä from Espoo was distressed by the fate of those who traveled by train farther from the city.
"It's especially miserable for those who have to re-plan their trip", he said, as he grinned at the Y-train.
I promise you a little relief.
A new railway connection is likely to be built to the coastline, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Regional Transport (HSL) area, which will take you to Kirkkonumm.
This will result in additional costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to investigate the different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices", said HSL's CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
The costs are not yet possible to estimate precisely.
Rihtniemi explains that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y-train approximately one million per year, although the Ministry has paid much more.
The R line coming up the hill is missing two stations.
In contrast, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
There are 28 small stations and numerous routes throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Spiders-Joensuu route is shortened to Spiders-Stealing.
The railway lines are decreasing on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million journeys are made in the year on the cancellable shifts, while the total number of journeys on the Ministry's purchased transport is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring about an annual saving of 12.3 million euros for the State.
The contract is worth approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in his book The Presentation of Capital: "Marx is worth learning about"
The crisis in the world economy has brought to the fore Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his major work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, former chairman of the SKP, in his book The Timeliness of Marx's Capital, published today.
"He is being taken more seriously than he has been in a long time", Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development of capitalist economy, its internationalisation and ever-widening penetration into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The author of the book based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakasen is also Professor Sixten Korkman, a respected economist at Aalto University.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever".
But the former director of the Institute for Economic Research and the Commission for Economic Affairs is not a Marxist, is he?
No, not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a contemporary economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are divided and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary scholar.
"The common view is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men", Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions were badly miscalculated.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the beginnings of capitalism that were too far-reaching, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical stance.
"What's relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions", he says.
Now, let's talk about Marx's interests again, like the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be an inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of technological revolution", Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is no help.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just end.
But Korkman thinks it's worth getting to know Marx.
"In the '70s, you couldn't read Marx", says Korkman.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more so each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can be approached without the ideological and political weight of the past.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's thought world - as well as with the other classics", says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be tried in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during Sri Lanka's civil war, AFP news agency reports.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 was published on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
The civil war in Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There's no exact number of casualties either.
The UN report calls for a thorough investigation of the large-scale military offensive in the last months of the long war in 2009.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan armed forces of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, with victims as likely as men and women.
The report says the rebels have been guilty of forcing outsiders and children into combat.
Both parties are guilty of murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it will conduct the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
The English yo-yo test got a social media hit.
The autumn student rolls were in long foreign language on Wednesday, with English predominant.
More than 16,000 students were tested for English.
You could write a paper on social media.
We had to ask ourselves, based on our own experiences, if social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the 150-250-word English article could be shown to the owner of the webpage's advice column.
The headline was "Dear Agony Aunt".
Agony Aunt is responsible for Leela's Finnish lounge chairs.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to see things from the young ones' point of view.
There were four subjects in all, one of which had to be chosen.
"That was the hardest", said Mia Lybeck, English teacher at Porvoo Swedish High School, in the third subject.
The third item was merely a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth theme, Lybeck said it was pretty cool.
It was supposed to be a fireside address about why companies should hire young people.
"At least in our school, there is a practice of writing speeches", says Lybeck, who rates the whole experiment as "quite normal".
The English test in Finnish - or Swedish - was based on texts such as the summer camel's adaptation to climate change and the processing of large amounts of data.
On Wednesdays, some longer Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn writing continues on Friday, when it is the turn of another native, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
The exam is held in the normal way in the high schools, so it is not affected by the protest of the salaried.
The University Grants Commission urges students to find suitable transport links in time to be able to take the test.
The time may be increased if it can be shown that the delay was not due to negligence.
A store was robbed at gunpoint in Oulu .
A shop in the Kelo district of Oulu was robbed on Wednesday morning.
Police say the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering commando vest.
He's a normal-sized man, in his early 30s.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and had taken a small amount of money as a prize.
They're investigating it as a major robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters arriving in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
A demonstration against the government's cut-down measures will hit central Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
Forecasts suggest that tens of thousands of people may attend.
The members of the SAK, Aqaba and STTK unions will meet at the Rautatientor at 11 o'clock.
Police are also believed to be participating in the demonstration.
The task of the police on duty is not only to carry out the alarm and other police duties, but also to ensure the smooth running of the giant's expression.
The roads leading to the railway zone will be closed to motor vehicles for approximately 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From Hakaneem, traffic is cut off from the Kaisaniem traffic circle, from the west from the Mainland.
Are you sure the Helsinki police department is manned enough, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For now, it looks like we're done.
I'm not taking sides on police work-fighting issues.
Kujala is also sending support patrols from other parts of Finland to Helsinki for the demonstration.
The police won't give us the exact number of patrols.
"There's some coming, but we're generally fine on our own", says Kujala.
Police are advising people to avoid private cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jams extend from Hakaneeme level to its core.
Traffic will be expected to be stationary from dawn to dusk.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, many buses are also arriving in Helsinki.
They're not allowed in the Iron Shard.
The buses will stay pretty far away, basically.
The end of the journey is to walk to the protest site", Kujala says.
The protest will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's point of view, there's a silver lining.
The problem of the smooth operation of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings, is now partly solved.
The organisers of the protest have informed the police that tens of thousands of people may be coming to Helsinki to protest the government's economic policies.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
After all, the population is ordinary working people, or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are reasonable and peaceful people", says Kujala.
Local demonstrations are also held on Fridays in various parts of Finland.
Friday's demonstration is in many ways exceptional. Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big trade union demonstration on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, it has no good comparison in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiäinen, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
In itself, it's no wonder the A-M-A protested.
If it didn't, it would raise its hands in front of the government, says the Mushroom.
The very right-wing government has attacked the core of the Finnish corporatist tradition - and also points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough-guy grip on the law of contract is a violation of the law of contract.
There are many features of this that really try to bring the labour movement to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
The need for a mirror is, for example, because the labour movement does not have the support of all the employees for the Friday demonstrations.
What is new is the sharp division which the demonstration will produce among the people whom the labour movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland and demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you look for a comparison to the Friday demonstration, it could be the giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, organized in 1993, says Siisiäinen.
In the midst of the deepest depression, the Great Depression gathered 20,000 unemployed people.
The government of Esko Aho (centre) was going from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and the wage-earning organizations had never been as bad as during the bourgeois government of Aho.
The government and the labour movement are perhaps even worse off than they were in the days of the Great Depression.
Besides, the most bourgeois government ever in Finland is now in power, says Siisiäinen.
The current coalition government is even more interesting in that it is so far right-wing despite the talk of fundamentalists.
At that time there were still certain elements of the old workers' movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to arrive on Friday.
The protest will also stop public transport and possibly close day care centers and schools.
Even if the demonstration doesn't garner the undivided support of the wage earners, it could be the biggest in years.
In recent years, Helsinki has hosted some 300 demonstrations a year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the Finnish labour movement has been relatively peaceful in its demonstrations, although its methods have become more rigid in recent years.
Traditionally, in Finnish demonstrations, conflict is avoided, and the law is obeyed.
The protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, says the Fox.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The protest culture has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on their heads.
The firemen's strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes among pilots and flight attendants.
Remember those strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strikes of 1971 and the power and electricity strikes of 1977.
70,000 metal workers took part in the metal workers' strike.
The strike was suspended by the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of strike action.
The metal men got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, a power strike lasted 49 days, causing power outages across the country.
The breakthrough in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom had been made unemployed by the recession, gathered in front of the House of Representatives to vote for work.
The firemen went on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest nationwide strike.
Farmers protested against the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in the rain of eggs during the anti-EU farmers' protests in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops", was one of the slogans.
The farmers of Espalle picked up tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also led to farmers protesting and burning haystacks in front of the venue.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995.
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marred by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass movements of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass deportation hastened the negotiations to a final outcome.
Doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - compulsorily", was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and sparked a lively debate about how strikes could jeopardize patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Some 5 000 students marched for student aid in Helsinki from the Senate Tower to the Parliament House in 2013.
The Central Crime Police is investigating the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested the Central Criminal Police to help them with the background of the refugee convoy registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees in Aisterheim, near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the ice-cream truck were all in good shape.
We've been in communication with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility will be at the scene in Austria, says the Chief Commissioner of the Central Criminal Police, Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, more fateful events befell other refugees in Austria in a truck.
All 71 passengers on board died, apparently by suffocation.
According to Yleisradion, the truck belongs to a Finnish joint-stock company.
The company operates a restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign origin, in his 40s.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for smuggling people.
The story of five smugglers, a captain who beat up refugees, a former drug runner and a wealthy businessman
A rebellious king of smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylish missionary, and a cab driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, people like this are smuggling people into the European Union.
University of Trento criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients", and their book Death's Travel Agency is coming out in Finnish this week.
In the book they present the complexities of human trafficking, offer solutions, and present smugglers at different levels of the business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I 'll beat the crap out of them .
The Kerkenna Islands off the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians go there for their summer vacation.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling because of their location, as the distance to Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chained captain and father of six.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fisherman is more profitable in transporting people.
Emir has done it hundreds of times with his blue, 10-meter wooden boat.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
The Emir earns about EUR 8,000 per trip after expenses.
The Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Clients come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, things calmed down until the refugee crisis again hit.
Clients arrive from the mainland in small groups on Kerkenna Island.
The Emir will keep them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is served in such a way that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about $75 a night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We'll go out to sea at midnight with the torch off.
The first night, you drive off the islands, then you stop, wait for the day, and the next night you drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves as high as 60 feet [20 m], the passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo will be unloaded in half an hour and Emir will leave for the return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beat the hangmen to death.
In the book, he tells that when the police caught him by surprise, he threw all his passengers overboard and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed the customers by the neck and threw them overboard", Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the sub-Saharan.
His countrymen say he's gonna have to beat him up about this.
I'll beat the crap out of them.
We need to show them who's in charge here right now.
Just a regular cab driver .
Goran is just a regular taxi driver in Bogova, Serbia.
His cab's not very good. The starter is dragging its last, and it's had its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are admitted.
In the forests surrounding the center, men traveling without their families take shelter in tents, lavabo, and abandoned cars, which each has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted their asylum applications to Serbia.
Some of them are also staying in private homes, but it's a public secret.
Goran finds most of his clients among the wildlings.
These are often quite exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a great deal of border crossing and weeks of walking in rough terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in Bogova, the hub of a major human smuggling operation, the people are exhausted.
The people on board Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
His best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say it once and it's enough", Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to get in.
That's not what Goran likes.
He's been going on and on and on all the way.
First, they agree on a price, say 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a kind and good-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people", he says in the book.
Goran says he works for less than others and charges only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's a hundred miles, most of it on the freeway.
I hear the other guys are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a lot for a smuggler, but in Serbia, it's a pretty good annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis may not transport migrants within 12 kilometres of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care. He knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his passengers a mile from the border.
Then he points to his clients in the right direction and runs away.
In the Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese is called Missionary, not just a nickname.
He does have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, which is frequented by Congolese refugees, as well as a small center for Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business that moves people from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a job of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of his white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of his jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary is not preaching, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five Missionary telephone numbers.
He advises arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money in the trash and mingling with the traders crossing the border.
To be granted asylum or refugee status, you must tell the Ugandan authorities that you are from war zones, such as North Kivu, and that you have been forced to flee violence in your home.
Often that's true, but if it's not, the missionary will arrange for the client to have a new identity.
The old ID card will be destroyed and replaced by a new one.
The missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police are helping.
After that, the client is directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum application process, NGOs, and finally the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself came to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step individually: an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, documentation to a humanitarian organization about 150 euros, and the process of moving to a European country, for example, costs between 4 500 and 7 000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a budding smuggler, former drug runner.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty off the French coast at Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks en route to Britain.
He has the help of an Afghan in London, a French taxi driver, and dozens of truckers who may not even know they're in the smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually two or three people, somewhere in the vicinity of downtown Calais.
They're driving on the A26 motorway, trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been in for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his clients run across the motorway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses the right truck, makes sure it's headed for England and not, say, Holland, and cuts the safety wire of the shield.
We have to do it quietly, so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the job is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in aluminum foil, similar to what is wrapped around a roast or an oven dish in the kitchen.
That should keep the police's heat scanners from detecting the person hiding.
Some use an ice-filled sleeping bag for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves, hoping he won't drive the hitchhikers out of Britain.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The wealthy Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, controlling the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money on arrival.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship scam: chartering pleasure boats from Turkish ports to take American or European families on comfortable, few-day tourist cruises.
In reality, the ships are full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans who are transported from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe for a fee of EUR 5 000 to 7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are being crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide in the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, we must get aboard quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under deck the entire journey.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as there is no other sign of a crowd.
Food and drink are provided, but the fewer passengers who vomit and defecate, the better.
Mr Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 per luxury cruise after the costs.
He does not handle practical matters himself but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other minor factors to do the work for him.
During the summer, transportation is arranged in hundreds of ways, and Küçük makes millions.
He's been suspected of buying land through shell companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred apartments that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party (TDP) parliament and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he's apparently disappeared.
Correction: September 16, 2015 at 3:10 p.m. The Death Travel Book is coming out this week, not next week.
An American Olympic runner tells in her book about her illness and her prostitution
A new book by three-time Olympic 1500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of quitting his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the race in top form and ran the second fastest time in the race.
But in the final, he panicked.
He jumped to the top right from the start and defended his lead with a maniacal run.
But 150 yards before the goal, his strength ran out.
He collapsed on the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself to cross the finish line, Favor Hamilton tells us in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide the year before the Sydney Games, and he himself was under tremendous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of making money by having sex with strange men.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her action.
The tax on Favor Hamilton was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that she longed for the same adrenaline spikes she had received when competing in the sport of track and field.
Favor Hamilton later found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000 he set the world record in the 1500 meters in a time of 3.57.40, but he finished last in the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion was delighted when the federation put the Norwegian skier on the "straight leg" list.
The Norwegian ski king, Petter Northug, has gone beyond the bounds of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been in a state of reversal throughout the summer and autumn, as they did last year, from the athlete's contract.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northuge from the World Cup for the upcoming season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the skier in charge.
"Thank you for showing your back", Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook page.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the federation's sponsor", he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would like to be part of the national team for the season so he can promote his own sponsor.
Mr Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that also cares for future generations and does not allow one athlete to go solo.
He also recalled that the Union had granted Northug financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been a part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug issued a statement on Tuesday, saying he wanted to play in Norway's colours at the World Cup next season and at the World Cup and Olympics afterwards.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six medals at the World Championships, two of them gold.
He was on the team that won the gold medal in Falun last winter.
The day of the shield-maker is also celebrated in the Nordic countries
On 25 September, the day of the shield, there will be a parade of the various restaurants and shops which have been awarded the shield of the "Cooking-Translators".
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of expertise in the food sector and to lower the barrier of going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the label as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-end restaurants are concentrated in the capital area, but that top-end restaurants, which are inspected and rated by an independent operator, can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is a demonstration of the significance of the event as part of the awareness raising of T-shirt restaurants and the organisation.
In the Nordic countries, the day is celebrated at Vaasa, a restaurant in Fond du Nord and in Kantarellis.
The Old Town restaurant is participating in the Shield Day collection.
The event has also attracted considerable international attention.
It was decided to make the event one of the organization's most important international events, held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki-journal: Sued for the establishment of a terrible reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhavan garrison, which is now owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure of a crisis nature, which is still permanently located in the area and used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland Erillisverkot Oy, is still in operation.
Kauhajoki-jurnal reports that the individual claimed that the placement of the reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant security risk, which was not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
The complainant claims that the Defence Forces may have interests in the former Air Force Academy site and its airport, the impact of which has not been ascertained during the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case notes that, in the case of Kauhavana, negotiations have been ongoing for the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the entry of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with, inter alia, Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (PS) and the Minister of Defence's Chief of Staff, Arto Rädy.
The individual states to the Chancellor that the complaint is not about the reception centre's objection in principle but about the incorrect location of the planned site in the former garrison area.
The dreadful city council discussed the reception center issue last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'common transit' in the directive.
The President said that the concern for the management of the refugee situation united all the participants.
He also called for the EU to be involved in the negotiations on the future of the EU.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
The Council is optimistic about the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. if the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further tension on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also mentioned in the discussions, according to Mr Niinistö.
The President did not take a position on the labour market.
Finnair is cancelling 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot's closed for a couple of hours.
One flight is cancelled Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia is reported to have sought to manage airport operations during the stoppage by means of a supervisory force.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checks and other service points.
The protest closes down the streets of Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close down the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the railway yard will be closed to cars from about 9:30 to 2:00.
From the mainland, cars are not allowed on Mine Street, Post Street or Work Bay Street in the direction of the railway station.
From Union Street in Hakaniemi direction, traffic is directed to Union Street at the Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
Police say the closing time depends on the number of people attending the rally.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and wheelchair drivers in the whole Friday demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will participate in the demonstration on Friday from the morning traffic until the night traffic.
The Metro and Tramway Employees Association reported it to STT last night.
Most of Alko will be closed for two hours, including post office closures.
Friday's demonstration will also disrupt the Postal Service.
Significant delays are expected, for example in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the post office's service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross is carrying out blood drives despite the strike.
The food transportation, hospital shipments and laboratory samples are also being handled.
The Post's website provides up-to-date information on the services provided.
Most of the Finnish Alps will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The Pam Service Union has instructed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 1:00.
Pam has also urged grocery workers to take part in the trade union demonstration.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanom that they are trying to keep the stores open, if necessary with the help of the superintendent.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
The Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports that the daycare centres in Helsinki will not be fully functional on Friday.
Due to the protest of professional organisations, daycare may be concentrated in certain day-care centres and club activities in day-care centres and playgrounds are not organised.
The 24-hour day care centres and the groups for children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities will remain open.
In addition, afternoons for students with developmental disabilities and autism are organized as normal.
The Early Childhood Education Agency promises to provide more information about the changes in operation tomorrow.
Media researcher: "The fly is taking a big risk"
According to the fly, communication requires a variety of channels, and the prime minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This kind of direct communication will be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in the House.
The fly did not want to assess how often the repeated habit of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches comes.
According to the Owl, the talks may not always be broadcast on the Upper Channel.
If any other channels sign up, we'll watch it.
"Now, tonight, this channel is used", said the Owl.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio address to the citizens.
The whole of this is rather complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel. The Owl survived.
The talk will be broadcast at 9.05 p.m. and 21.20 p.m. on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at the National Arena.
The fly takes a big risk
A media analyst hopes that Owl's televised speech isn't a sign of a more general government turn inward.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define the public debate more firmly into one's own hands and to refuse to ask questions in the public debate?
I am reminded of the recent comment by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not let it define him.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related.
The dream is to understand that the commercial media is upset by the Owl's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not matters of publicity in a democracy.
The media's role is, by definition, to ensure that politicians' agendas are not taken for granted.
Koivus says that a television speech is a big risk for Sipil.
The fly should bring something new and special to the table when it speaks, in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there anything more on offer today than what we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Mr Koivunen says that if the promise is just another one of the same old ones, one has to wonder why such a big gesture was made and why the European Parliament gave it exceptional time.
It is also worth taking a risk in this sense, if it is not a special situation but a routine conversation among others.
The danger is that the EP will be branded as a message from politicians or from Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in the interests of the EP or in the general line.
A sly move by the mole
The media analyst points out that what the prime minister does not say is also important in the future speech of the ant.
In the evening, you should look closely at what the Sipilä is missing and what it is not, says research coordinator Heikki Kuutti of the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the six, the TV talk is a clever move by the Owl, because it allows him to express his own views without making a noise.
This is how you get a message to a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The whistle will bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger is that the media will misinterpret the speech because they will not be allowed to ask detailed questions.
According to the Six, it's very important how Owl appears on TV, whether he sweats, shakes his hands.
He compares the Owl to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If the Owl can make his case, it might work.
It is different from a government notification because it is as if one person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his associates do on a regular basis.
Really exceptional .
Political analyst Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
He said that it had not happened for decades that a prime minister spoke directly to the people.
"Exceptional times call for exceptional means", says Railo.
The researcher suggests that the Prime Minister wants to get the Finns to accept the blackmailing that is coming.
The unions are holding a protest and strike against the government's actions on Friday.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow discussion.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East.
This is no time for monologues.
It's almost six months before the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy who was on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was in good health when he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Finnish Police also confirms the situation to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, no contact was made.
Dad thanks everyone who helped him find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations over the past few hours.
The update was shared nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible amount in such a short time.
Finnish UFC star disappointed by youth violence: You're causing hate
Kurdish freelancer Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook, appealing specifically to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani made a powerful speech against street fights among young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won both of his professional fights in the most prestigious UFC freestyle series so far.
Amirkani says he got a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos of teenagers fighting with extreme violence have been uploaded to the account.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the way the young are being driven wild.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick people on the ground, sit on top of each other and punch them without thinking about the consequences, what this will do when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, fighting videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
I mean, you guys are fighting on the street.
You are making it harder for many other immigrants to live here in Finland, Amirkhani, a Turk, reminds us.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland that look for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite a lot.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be strangers here for quite a long time.
That's a little different way of saying thank you for letting us be here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of racism, you can blame it on yourself.
Now, think twice before you go along with this, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You're creating a kind of hatred in the mosque that I don't like myself.
You're in pretty bad shape anyway, and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK will take a position on the austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employee organisation would consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings scheme proposed by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The STTK, a civil service centre, said earlier on Wednesday that it would submit its own proposal to the government to achieve the five percent productivity cut demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the agreement to include the following areas:
However, this would require the biggest employer organisation, SAK, to soften its position.
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a brief comment on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK working committee will consider the matter on Monday.
Lylly said that the SAK is looking for solutions to 'open the labour market' and that instead of compulsory laws, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly recalls that the proposal for a social contract from the Prime Minister Sipilä's government did not suit SAK.
The company had previously broken off the negotiations on the social contract when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: "The big protest is about to go down - " "Does it feel a little funny to wear a fist?"
It feels a little weird to punch when you already have the settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The mood varies from camp to camp.
Is this about screaming for the government to go down, or is this about making a deal with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK alliance erupted in holy rage against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The threat would spread to the Akwa Ibom.
The teachers' union, OAJ, threatened to close schools and day care centers.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or day care centers will be closed completely.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (S), President of the STSC, made a conciliatory statement.
He said he had contacted the government and was preparing an alternative proposal for a five percent productivity gap, as demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Mr Sture Fjäder (Co-Chairman) was quick to announce that his agreement paper was ready.
At first, there was no word from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lylyn (S&D) is having a hard time agreeing when the leaders of the coalition just on Monday ordered the country to stand by on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK's Labour Committee would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions to "open the labour market".
In order to create a common position among employees, SAK would have to accept a 5% productivity shift as a target.
No wonder the Palolan STTK has good relations with the Owl government.
The right-hand man of Palola, the head of the STTK responsible for social activism, Jukka Ihanus, was previously a special assistant to the central ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
The report also points out that the government's skills have been steadily improving.
Coincidentally or not, the Palola exit took a bit of a hit off the Finnish stand-up comedians, whose flagship is the AKT's Marko Piirainen (sd).
I know it feels a little weird to pick a fist when you've got the settlement paper in your pocket.

Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticized the Helsinki Summit.
The Russian Duma speaker, Sergei Naryshkin, believes that Mongolia is a better host for the Etsy than Finland.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Republic of Latvia has begun in the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, where Mr Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July celebrations in Helsinki.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians such as Naryshkin, who were on the EU sanctions list, to attend the meeting - a point the President managed to remind journalists.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin was also criticised in the United States, where he was denied entry.
Sanctions are political suicide on the part of the EU, declared Naryshkin.
The Russian delegation made it to Mongolia without difficulty, so Naryshkin continued to taunt Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results, unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshk has met in Ulaanbaatar with the chairman of the meeting, Ilkka Kanerva (cook), who has already spoken with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
Lock will face the real playoff monster, "Scorers in tight".
Tappara and Lukko continue their bull days in Hakam forest today, with both of them on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicted that there will be no real painting festival in Hakamets today.
Tappara went to Kuopia yesterday to win the 3-2 series against Kalpa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was at its worst from a two-goal deficit.
Tuesday was a lot more lucrative.
The Ravens' catch with the Blues coming off a strong start was a round zero, and the losses were 2-3.
Tough game, tight goals, if they play at all the same game as last year, Lock forward Janne Lahti anticipates the settings on the team's sidelines.
The killer has become a playoff nightmare for the Raumians.
Tappara has been in the middle of the pack in the last two seasons, and it's just the final of the Luko series.
Both times, a decisive seventh match has been required to settle.
Last season, Lukko broke the series in the fourth game, but Tappara got up in the next three and passed.
There are no major changes in the line-up, except for the goalkeepers.
Both cashiers, rejected yesterday, are being promoted to the top of the table today.
On the mating field, Mika Noronen makes room for Tom Bear, and between the lock-sticks, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsky.
Point of view: the aces are in for a nasty treat .
Sports director Toivola wrote a script for a sequel that was inappropriate for head coach Rautakalliou, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he played the lead role.
The underdogs have sensationally put the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, on the field.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he ended up losing the title game.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a script for the restless ash story of Pori.
The unnamed, knife-wielding bat pack surprised everyone by qualifying for the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of unnamed but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Peltos.
In the fall games, players dyed their heads red and cut off their irokises.
Hope turned into a blonde.
The great TV host, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The ace took the silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that this season's remake will work the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as the Athletic Director for the Aces has built a pot of cash on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been kicking ass at guys in the long-distance like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than playing on a reel.
Hope has forgotten that Rocky VI stars Big Iron Rock.
Carrie Stone has been christened Iron Horse Sean Connery.
Iron Fist is the same clumsy lead in Toyola's Rocky as Connery would have been in the original 1976 film.
There's nothing in the Iron Curtain but Rocky, nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Curtain is not about running and playing small.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, the Aces' Garret Stafford knocked Tappara's Jere Karelia in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play the ones who deserve it.
I don't approve of that kind of game, and it's not an ace game. The hot iron rock, after the game, was a wake-up call to the Hundred Nation.
The Aces this season are a weird team.
There's the nerds, the vets, the cops, the bodybuilders.
There are practically no key men of prime playing age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill shortage.
How much of an impact have you had on the player's trades, Big Iron?
The events of the last season affect procurement and unfortunately the market situation was rather tight, Irutakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a lot of dust underneath.
The 1953 model Iron Dome is reportedly interested in moving to the Toivola site as a sports venue.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The Aces have lost three league games this season, the same number of losses, 1-6.
I don't think Hope should have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen will play the mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under her husband's direction.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
It kind of feels crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughing.
She has been married to Apulanã's ex-bassist and conductor Tuukka Temes since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but this is the first time Olga is acting under Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, which tells about the early years of Apulan, is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuki, Sirkka.
Sirkka chants and supports her son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my real role model, Sirkka, the easier it seems to me to play the part.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
The shark has been a big help.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the biggest band in Finland.
It was the '90s, the recession, and it was really bad.
There was a pretty slim chance that anyone would actually succeed, but Sirca had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard much from Tuuka about his youth even before the film plans.
But the stories of the parents have been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know what you're talking about?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, Heinola's infamous skater.
Olga was an old and kind girl who would have had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
The best he could do is secretly fall in love.
Olga says she's worked so much with Tuuka over the last 10 years that she's not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything's always been going super well.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple in Itia will often drive home overnight for their young children, since the distance is not too long.
We'll take the whole of Heinola for a month.
They've given us a very warm welcome, just asking which streets and when they're going to clear.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive Finnish drama film
The budget of the film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
We start filming in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is set to become Finland's most expensive drama film of all time with a budget of €17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been held by Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The upcoming Angry Birds animation will also surpass Iron Sky 2 after completion, with a budget of over 100 million euros.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaan, will begin filming in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of a huge budget.
I've been sick and tired!
I'm so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what kind of movie it should be.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
No matter how tight the time is, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I can't wait to show this film to the public, he tells the Evening Post.
The film was originally budgeted at 8 to 10 million, but as the script developed, the budget grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story too.
But you could get 100 million into the movie because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything's twisted so tightly, there's not a single loose end.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign on Wednesday, and a bond loan, which pays an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final rate will be determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
The company will repay the loan within two years.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov, among others.
Junt or cool?
Big logos are coming back on the shirts.
The trendsetters' headlines have been decorated with big logos lately.
Not long ago, the fashion-conscious dressed man avoided large, clear logos like Crocs in a crown.
Advertising a hoodie or a T-shirt was seen as somewhat of a fad.
But times change.
Sport has become a true fashion mega-trend, and so have old, familiar sportswear brands like Adidas and Nike risen to the brim of cool.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already really cool, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First, there was the norm core trend, where the trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothing as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of the basic gray collar, they put on the web-shirt buried at the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer's logo on the front.
The bigger, the more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, the iconic Adidas striped shirts, the shirts of their favorite teams and the New York Yankees tickets have also made a comeback.
The Calvin Klein logos on the edge of the jeans, the underwear that makes you laugh, are a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn sweaters makes it clear what type of clothing is involved.
Would you be willing to show off your logos in your outfit?
A Russian politician released proof that I wasn't stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
The allegations were that an unusual incident occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held, which showcased Russian military products.
In recent days, the Russian media have spread colorful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to detach the large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his public Facebook page, showing him peering into the hatch of an armored vehicle in a rather good mood and at least according to the pictures there is no trapped or angry feeling.
It's full of crap.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the tank. It was a BMP-3 assault tank.
I'm an ex-soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around, and came out calmly, Zotov told Pravda Komsomolskaja.
I didn't get stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian military television that he was fascinated by the exhibition of new Russian technology because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriages, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the backpack, he said.
I've been to every tank in the world.
And at the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One of the fools wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
"I'm tall and slender, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, nothing like that happened", he told Russian radio station sluzhba novotei.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged entrapment have been published, although the exhibition was visited by a total of 50,000 people in a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's entrapment originated from a story on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told to flinch as he tried to get out of the tank hatch and threatened to eventually shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a sequel in which the exhibition organizers shared their own view of what had happened.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, because of his size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.
This is a favorite item of interior bloggers.
The 1962 Lassen nail by architects Viljesten Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks as if it were designed today.
A cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that's what it was originally.
Architectural polishes are known to refine the shape of the nail for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was initially presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the gentlemen.
Kubus is manufactured by the family-owned company By Lassen, which has maintained the design heritage of the famous brothers.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked into the ditch from what is called the richness pool.
The company says that the leak has been remediated.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment foam and purified process water from the foaming process.
The water is usually either pumped for reuse as process water or, as permitted, discharged into the environment via a surface-level field.
The estimated volume of the leak was about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
The company claims that the quality of the leakage is in line with the current permit requirements.
No other material was released into the environment.
The leak was detected on a rounds of inspection Monday morning.
No structural damage to the pool's support structures has been detected.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and rectify the situation.
The mine employs about 600 permanent workers.
Danish Bank: IMF warns against cutting too much
The report on Finland's land, published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), largely reflects the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation has been pioneering structural reforms across Finland to overcome the economic problems.
The IMF believes that reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the whole contract system and in unemployment protection.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäen, chief economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of sympathetic messages about government action, but also contains a warning about what should not be cut too much.
This is the case, for example, with infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to T Ekonomijsonoom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske today, in its new relationship forecast, forecast growth to be zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They could have been based on the latest findings.
This morning the Statistical Office reported that total production had been growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
The Commission has also been able to draw less attention to the weakening of industrial confidence or to other so-called softer measures.
However, the differences are only a few percent of the decimal point.
Nintendo has appointed a new CEO
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata had been at the helm of Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were brought up as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima's task is seen as bringing Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but not eating the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minors seeking asylum are arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency admitted that up to hundreds of children who have arrived in the country disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of underage applicants disappear every year, according to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, among others.
The Chief Inspector of the Immigration Office, Juha Kannelmaa, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many asylum seekers go "underground" every year? - In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made by minors who came alone.
Nine of them are missing.
In 2014, 196 such applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, reports Kannelmaa.
The disappearance may be caused by the fact that the proceedings reveal that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has been, if necessary, declared to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of those who disappear are also found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3,651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were dismissed on the grounds that the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from minors who have come alone.
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of transparency in the EU's financial markets, which is a major source of uncertainty for the EU.
What about those who have made the decision to convert?
Are they also disappearing into the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess at the Immigration Office, as the police are responsible for enforcing return decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
The Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (K) has expressed concern about the growing number of unregistered asylum seekers.
He's been working on it.
The European Union is also committed to the implementation of the European Union's common foreign and security policy.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A. ' s studio online . See the pictures of the equipment .
The equipment used by media entrepreneur Timo T.A. Mikkos for TV and radio productions, who lost his ability to work because of illness, is now for sale.
Mikkosen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced tools for professionals in its field.
The first online publication I heard about the ad was in my evening magazine.
Today, much of the equipment is stuck in the technological development.
In the digital media world, you don't record TV shows on Betacam tapes anymore.
But Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interest.
Of course, the equipment is no longer so up-to-date, but it is still needed as long as there is an old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is because the Mikkos are looking to move out of their current home in the Hurricane.
There's no way we can take all the merchandise with us.
I've been doing a little inventory, looking at what's being given away.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
No more use for TVs and radios.
It's clear from the aftermath of his recent stroke that a man with a long career will never return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now we only sell goods and equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkos's real life work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box store to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic is at risk of deterioration, with the subway and tram stopping all Friday
Metro and tram drivers are deciding today whether to expand their enforcement efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to halt subway and tram traffic only for the Friday demonstration.
The afternoon will decide whether or not traffic will stop for the rest of the day.
Chief of staff, Pekka Hirvonen, says there's a big threat on the field.
Night and shift cuts are a major drag on drivers, so government plans to cut down the lions are facing opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic for the whole day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area will be almost completely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not run on Fridays between 6am and 6pm.
Friday, there's no traffic in or out.
Trains departing before midnight will be driven to their destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left behind.
The members of the ACP-EEC Committee are absent from work from 3 a.m. on Friday to 3 a.m. on Saturday.
A small number of buses are likely to be driven, driven by the driver, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo believes.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly what bus routes will run on Friday.
The employer organisations are holding a grand rally at the Helsinki Railway Station on Friday from 11am to 1pm.
Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred near the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to get ahead into Europe, reports the AP news agency.
Sky News has reported that the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of them women and children, fled in a panic.
Local media reported that Hungarian police had also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas . The teacher thought the homemade clock was a bomb .
In Texas, U.S.A., 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after a teacher held a homemade watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the profits from his electronics business.
One of the teachers, however, kept the clock exactly like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to the juvenile detention center.
At no point has Muhammad been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, it's possible that the boy could be charged with making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found the watch to look like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished by three days of school leave.
Her father is furious about the case, and the country's American-Islamic Council is considering whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is getting better - Labour leader refuses to sing the national anthem
The song is a plea to God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has been echoed by Corbyn's own Labour MPs.
This has offended the people, said Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service honored the British Air Force pilots' fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and stresses that he showed his respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We are all deeply indebted to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement said.
Corbyn's election as party leader has split Labour.
There are those in Parliament who fear that he will drive out moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament for the first time as party leader for the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what questions he should ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted at the weekend about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is a threat to our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family murder remains unclear . The father of the family was awaiting trial .
The South Lake Minnetonka Police Department is investigating a week-long family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a few days later, police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with his first shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of his house.
Dead for days .
The family was found after a school worries about missing children.
Based on this report, the police went to the house for a search and found the Short family dead on all sides of a huge house.
According to Star Tribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millionaire House and Successful Business
The investigation into the death of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Sitari is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloodshed remains unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful businessman who had made his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com, which was geared toward nurses.
In a 2014 interview with Star Tribune, Short said the site had four million different visitors each week.
I've had 50 offers to buy the company in the last 10 years.
I've abandoned all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe I'll sell the company at some point, but not yet.
One of the things that helped them succeed was that in 2011, the Short family bought a modest home in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate website Zillows as the dream of a car collector: not only does it have 12 rooms, but it also has a garage for eight cars.
The case is pending
But according to Star Tribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers a variety of prep courses, had sued her over comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short's website had not removed comments insulting the prep courses and as a result they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to Star Tribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
The Loire Valley offered cake and coffee
In addition, the three owners were awarded the Finnish Hippo Horse Owner of the Month award at a nutrition event.
This is great. Loiri's commentary is very good.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday in September, earning €100,000.
The legendary artist Loiri was still confused by the success of the Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still can't believe it happened.
Successful horse trainer Corpi, with Loir, gets complete peace of mind working with the horse.

"The greatest donation ever made by an athlete".
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a hospital press release, this is the largest single donation to charity in Canada by an athlete.
In addition, Subban, 26, has committed to assisting the hospital with other funding for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
Subban's donation is significantly larger than his annual income of $9 million.
In return for his donation, Subban will receive a hall bearing his name from the hospital.
The Canadiens have had a history of helping local hospitals.
A year ago, the late longtime captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum for another major city hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
A Japanese cafe can be ordered for a wife's dinner, serves food in nothing but bikinis and a scarf.
Teahouses are a tough thing in Japan.
There's goat coffee, rabbit coffee, vampire coffee, brownie coffee, and now wife coffee.
It's going to hit the lonely, the sociable, the hungry.
Metro is reporting on it.
The Tokyo Ore no Yome (My Wife) Cafe is a place where you can order your own wife or husband's evening.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "husband" is selected from the list before entering the cafe, and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is wearing a skirt and a bikini, and the husband is wearing tight-fitting biking shorts.
The website provides candidates with all the information they need, from height and weight to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected: The car security attack is being prepared
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a press release issued by Intel.
The board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
The ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and audits with the aim of standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of its cybersecurity best practices.
The company will update the report in the future based on the findings of the ASRB.
The global ICT research and consultancy firm Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate shows that 60 to 75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, president of Intel Security.
The ASRB will enable Intel to establish best practices in security and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been a monthly highlight for years.
Finally, the car is starting to be in sight in Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the eyes of the automotive world are on the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-cylinder RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds with its 2.3-liter 350-horsepower engine and reaches a top speed of 175 miles per hour (266 km/ h).
The price is also of interest in Finland, with a preliminary figure of EUR 52 000.
The car is now available for order, although Ford does not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
The popular Kia brand presented two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show - the new Sportage and the Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two new Finnish models, with which Kia intends to capture a larger share of the ever-growing market for street cars.
The Sportage, designed by the new European design director Gregory Guillaume, is more round than before.
The wheelbase and outer axles have become an inch and an inch and the car is now more efficient in its airflow.
The engine range is essentially the same, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine producing 177 horsepower.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the price of the new Kia Sporttag.
We'll have to wait a little longer, because we're getting the new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimus arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand new car.
Kia is going to win the hearts of upper-middle class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
The Optimo will start with a 1.7-litre turbocharged diesel engine and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when they are joined by the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine.
At the same time as it arrives, Optima Farmer will be on sale.
Chisu returned to the stage, bursting into a bold, garish look.
Singer Chisu is performing at the Life for a Child concert with other local stars.
The blue suit has a prominent, open neck hole.
The costume is a beautiful display of the singer's slim waist.
The whole thing is crowned with a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer-mother has shed the weight of her pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one.
The singer released her first single from the new album in August.
I'm not really excited about getting back on stage and in front of a big crowd after a long break.
"I've missed everything musically related", the singer says.
Chisu is releasing his new and fourth album in a couple of weeks called Polaris.
Your new life situation has inspired me to write new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people will find my new album, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian's motherly style is stunning again. Now you can see her breasts.
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian is giving one talk after another.
She's showing off her pregnancy and breasts in sexy clothes, most recently last night at 1:00 AM US time, when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian and her husband Kanye West for a concert.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It'll reveal the skin-colored bras underneath the dress in the flash of lightning.
The last time Kardashian wore her fancy maternity suit was at a dinner party at her friend's house in New York just a few days ago.
The black boots of the upper generation emphasized the look.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last Friday when the show was full of pregnant women.
The hardest rules of the modeling world: no home, you're lonely, the competition is fierce
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to narrow down the idea of the modeling world as a pure glamour and champagne party.
She made her own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and her colleagues talk openly about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar has compiled six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
While last season you were posing in the costumes of top designers, this new season is starting again with castings.
And every season, there's a new, fresh face in the industry, competing for the job with the big boys.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is a constant journey and may take years, with the accommodation being a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses house their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the most desirable jobs, but they're the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to lose weight, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a gamble.
At Fashion Week, models and designers are always together, and they also act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the separation is a little bit of a hassle.
Models want to be in the business because of the opportunities it offers, but they are tainted by the fact that everyone thinks the job is just a display of clothes.
Models want to be their own person.
It makes the models feel like they're actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of modeling.
The models at the Tory Burch show last night.
New York is currently hosting Fashion Week, where designers are unveiling their next year's lineup.
Roope Salminen , who changed his style , will play the most unknown musician of the Apulanta in the film .
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the band's founder, in the film based on the early years of the Apulanta group.
The singer founded Apulannan in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but left the group in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me, because I'm about to turn 26 as a rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've been trying to avoid meeting the real Ant before filming because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the least known to the public, so I think it's a good thing I'm learning his playing style just from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a human.
A man who trusts the Roope Salmon and Dogs Association on a whim will not be cast.
Punk manners are a man's nature.
I'm sure many of you saw the first episode of the punk-punk episode of "Stars, Stars", as well as those who have ever been to our shows.
Our gigs have never been anything short of a road trip, but we always go full steam ahead.
The main actors of the movie "You're Beautiful" directed by Tuukka Temes, who played bass in the band from 1993 to 2004, were announced today.
The core of the band, which has become familiar to the public, is played by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the public.
The drummer Sipe Santapukkia is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasa from Tatu Sinisalo and bassist Tuukka Temos from Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of his upcoming gig last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat he was preparing for the biggest day of his career.
Roope has already posted a picture on Instagram yesterday of his new look, which he has had to do for the film.
Roope, seen in the moustache and leather jacket before, has turned his face into silos, and dyed his brown hair black.
This is how you tell your kids about refugees.
Many parents have had to wonder in recent days how to tell their children about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
It is not necessary to force the issue, advises psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Younger children are to be protected, for example, by not letting them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can be mind-boggling and distressing, he says.
However, if a child has seen news pictures of refugees on television or has heard about them from other sources, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to start a conversation about the child's background and listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may come as a surprise.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're worried and scared.
A younger child closely observes the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will feel secure.
Older children are more likely to encounter discussions about refugees at school, with their friends, or on the Internet.
Parents do well to discuss the matter with them if the child is thinking.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents can discuss with their children how this is done in our family.
But is the world, after all, a safe place or an unsafe place?
Parents may also have different views on parenting - some may want to protect their children from distress as much as possible.
On the other hand, if difficult matters are discussed in the family, the child will be given a model for how to deal with the difficulties that come his way.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weak"
You're out of power?
You can still be a good parent to your child
The ball is hitting Vermo , hard to contain .
Perttu Pohjola was honed in the middle of summer to support the Apilan Balloslam.
It was only winning and finishing second, until the Tampere rave collapsed at the end of July.
Because of the deep-seated anger, the trainer suspected something was wrong and ordered a protective time from the vet.
The explanation for the blackout came out in the blink of an eye.
The horse had strep throat.
The disease was not mild, but it required two courses of medication to be controlled.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to do light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE pool in Turku in its record time after Taruntuul.
Apilla's ball-and-socket was under a lot of stress during the break, having been able to run normally for only a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, the slight slope at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
Coach assumes that a good competition gave the Ori a blade.
The horse's turn must have gone ahead of it, and hopefully it would have evened out too.
Apilla's Balls have been the so-called humor horses.
When it's not been enjoyed, it could have been thrown to fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, a sign has broken from the ori, so that opposers have been amazed.
At short speeds, competitors cannot make the Ballroom, from which even warm-blooded rides emerge.
The North wants a fencing run in Vermont.
But it's different how Apilan Ball Lake agrees to it.
It's kind of hard when you're going out and you might get a lot of spikes under the bumper of the car and stuff.
I hope the Ori are calmer than when Tur left.
Apilla's bowling alley can come out of the bowling alley when it's fit, and we're going to drive it for the win, Coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone apps.
Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple's iPhones may be removed at some point in the future - but not all.
Apple may plan to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, CEO Tim Cook told Buzzfeed magazine.
The iPhone has a number of applications that are relatively unused: FaceTime, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Wink.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a mandatory update to the iPhone, although it is only needed by Apple's smartwatch owners.
Cook says that deleting Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some of the apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If you remove them, it could cause problems on another phone somewhere, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications work in conjunction with other applications.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
So Cook says Apple is looking into it because the company doesn't want to waste memory on people's iPhones.
Euro area inflation fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, by 0.1% year-on-year, the EU's statistical office Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven down by the cheapening of energy.
Eurostat thus revised downwards from its preliminary estimate of 0.2% a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's forecast for base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than a year ago.
The EU-28 had a zero average inflation rate in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1%.
Of the euro area countries, Malta recorded the highest increase in consumer prices in August, at 1.4%.
Cyprus had the lowest rate of inflation at 1.9% in the period of falling prices.
In Finland, inflation was negative at 0.2% according to the EU's harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains firmly at the bottom of the European Central Bank's (ECB) mediumterm inflation target of 2%.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year, the rate will rise to 1.1%, as the central bank forecast in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The US Fed is next trying to tighten monetary policy .
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely in three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, begins its long-standing interest rate hike.
And in the financial markets, the downturn will begin before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may begin interest rate hikes as early as this week and no later than the end of the year.
The next recession could hit at its fastest by next autumn and the financial markets could be in a recession before then.
Or at least that's what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets operate as they have always done and if they react to the Fed's money-laundering as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, market strategists at Deutsche Bank London, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who prepared the study and the report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen to the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use the cold facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after the Fed rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they examine which key economic and financial market variables are now in the same or different pattern as at the time of previous rate hikes - and what may result.
Clearly, both the economy and the financial markets are now more resilient to rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950's.
The recession may not even start in a year.
The leaders of monetary policy and the Fed's monetary policy have been suggesting throughout the summer and early summer that the time is ripe for a rise in interest rates.
The first rate hike in over nine years could be this week.
The matter will be decided on Wednesday and Thursday when the Fed's so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds rate was in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but small rate hikes of 0.25 percentage points over two years, with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial market crisis began in 2007 with the most risky housing financing crisis in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis erupted into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, the serious contraction in financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than has typically been the case since the Fed raised interest rates in the past.
Similarly, the trials were harder and more severe than at any time since the depression of the 1930's.
Deutsche's strategists have been filtering the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and the turns of financial markets since the 1950s and in places since the early 19th century.
They've been backing the Fed's rate hikes and their economic and financial effects since the 1950s.
At the fastest, the time from the first recession to the start of the recession is less than a year, usually less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The financial market is closed within two years of the start of the Fed rate hike.
The Fed has raised and lowered its policy rate since the early 1950s for a dozen different cycles.
Each time has differed somewhat from the others, and the factors are relatively small in scope, so that it is hardly possible to draw any definite conclusions on the effects of the subsequent rate increases.
The strategists remind us that this time, a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Decades of research may not unquestionably reveal the root causes of the financial crisis and the perpetrators.
But three things about the causes of the crisis and the reasons for its destructive effects are probably somewhat undeniable:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other major central banks of the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They were repairing the traces of the tech plane, and growing the next one.
2) The excessive amount of debt accumulated over the decades in various parts of the financial and real economy was further increased by excessive monetary policy by the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history was born.
3) The crazy cheap debt financing, which was packed with the most precious assets in the financial economy in particular, inflated most parts of the financial markets into the largest exchange-rate bubbles in the history of the economy, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly a hard-hitting argument that financial markets, which have risen to the top under increasingly complex debt levers, were in a rare dangerous and volatile position when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures, which were adjusted to the debt ceiling, and even the valuation bubbles, only lasted for a time after the interest rate increases had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned upward.
The risks came in the financial crisis, followed by the Great Recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
The German strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of the debate a hint by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even more relaxed for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have been even lower for a longer period.
(2) Borrowing has long since been less insanely cheap than it was ten years ago, and now, at its cheapest, debt is literally cheaper than free.
The debt burden in the financial and real economies has not eased, but is now much heavier in various parts of the economy than before the financial crisis or almost ever before.
3) The liquidity from formerly more liquid and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial markets, pushing key securities and assets to their highest levels since the pre-financial crisis peak or ever.
And not only do strategists warn the mood in financial markets, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has yet to recover from the financial crisis and its worst recession in decades.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the financial market pressures and risks are correspondingly unprecedentedly greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts to tighten its monetary policy.
Perhaps the future of French bank Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it suddenly seems.
He has been training the bank's international investment clients for quite some time in the following full Fed translations:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubble bursts, and soon it's time for the Fed to rush to extinguish the financial fires with even greater QE monetary strikes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer manufacturer, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will be in HP's corporate services segment, the company said.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprises, which focuses on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP's workforce peaked in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, the staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records one-off costs of USD 2,7 billion (approximately EUR 2,4 billion) for the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprises is going to be cutting between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs.
The reductions on the consumer side will be 3300 over three years.
HP intends to move its operations to low-cost countries, with 60% of its workforce in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its turnover.
In another year, its three most important customers accounted for 65% of its turnover.

General: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Anne Berner (Central), has been a member of the board of directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities were linked to so-called tax planning.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Mr Berner himself says he resigned from the Commission in May of this year.
I checked it out, and I've just left a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the chain of registration takes place on the agreed schedule, Berner says in the interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted to the Finnish State in the form of a grant of EUR [...] million.
Berner was on the board of Karelia Upper Floor between 2010 and 2013 and on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company after the merger.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg are governed by a multi-tiered ownership structure.
Berner tells Yelle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of directors of Karelia Upper Floor, which is owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted by a partner in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to see that the capital interests of a Finnish family company were realized.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yale that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not tied to tax planning.
According to Mr Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax havens is due to the fact that the capital fund Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
A company-run reception centre opens in Espoo
The first enterprise-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers opens in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to accept the first 100 residents starting tonight.
The capacity can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Immigration Office will establish a reception centre on the premises of the former Salvation Academy.
The activities are carried out by Luona Oy, which is principally engaged in the provision of healthcare and nursing services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy have agreed on security arrangements for the centre.
The STTK is preparing an alternative work-life blackmail package
The STTK is preparing an alternative package to the government's blackmailing of working people.
The organisation also wishes to involve other central wage-earning organisations.
President Antti Palola said that the focus was on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways to reduce the cost of labour will be reviewed afterwards.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, Palola told reporters during the break from the organization's board meeting.
Palola believes that the Central Business Union (CE) is not ready for discussions.
STTK's economists have calculated that the change guarantee included in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, whereas the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for conversation when there's a one-to-one ratio.
Palola: The negotiating relationship was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternatives by Wednesday, when the government is due to deliver a package notice to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
The fire department didn't take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Union's external action programme.
The staff centre organisation for the STTK field, especially the Sunday-night cutting, is a painful place, according to Palola.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the compulsory legislation with which it would be implementing some of the blackmail.
The STCK, according to Palola, is not warming up to the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP which put the matter forward.
The workers will gather in Helsinki on Friday to protest the government's blackmail package on working life presented last week.
The package includes a cut in the first sick days, a halving of overtime pay, a reduction of Sunday pay to 75% and a shortening of holidays.
The STTK stresses that the central organizations have called for a demonstration of the wage earners and that the intention was not to organize a strike.
The Fjäder of Akavan thanks you
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of transparency in the EU's financial markets.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now on the same page as Aqaba, as an alternative model for government proposals has already been formulated in Aqaba.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without the SAK the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
The President of Akava, Mr Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, headed by Mr Lauri Lylyn, will come to prepare a proposal on alternatives to cuts.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
We want change insurance and time banks.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) and the European Fisheries Fund (EFF).
The Commission has always been willing to negotiate and we have been writing an alternative model for the government's proposals for a long time.
We're willing to consider the terms of service as part of the agreement.
In return, we want security for change and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also join the Aqaba lines, as the STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to create a model that will benefit the government and employers, says Fjäder.
The Akwa Working Committee will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

Prime Ministers have made extraordinary speeches in the past during the Mtshala Uprising and other wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation on the state of the Finnish economy on Wednesday night at 9.05pm on the Ylen Channel.
If you want to find a similar speech by a previous prime minister, you have to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was prime minister and gave the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mandzála rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers made several radio speeches during the winter and post-war years.
In the 1990s, President Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the fall of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the railway strike in a televised speech.
The monopoly, the monarchist mentality
The ant's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day about what's to come.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a statement by the prime minister, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Green Party's Ville Niinistö, "the one-to-one call has already been seen.
Leadership is about dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist sentiment: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
The SDP chairman, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "It is six months since the elections.
Not one appearance as Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We tried.
What is @juasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the State Council's office, Owl's speech is pre-recorded and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the comments were made by the SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and the CEO of EK, Jyri Häkämies, during the live broadcast.
I've been criticized for giving the Owl speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the public service's task to promote publicity across Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Publications at YLE in YLE News.
Like we did in the days of the Tameloes
The speech has also attracted ridicule.
When evening comes, the children are given a proper evening meal, combed and dressed to their finest.
Mommy puts on the prettiest collar and Dad fits the tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, the television is silent as it was in the old days of Me Tammeloes", writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain why the Finnish government has millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens, who are drafting amnesty laws for their tax-evading friends and at the same time telling the people that they have to cut back when the state runs out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the green leftist Viva of the University of Tampere.
It's posted a Facebook post with a bingo.
Tonight, we're gonna hear about the same boat, the same coal, the same debt, the same team spirit.
The coupons and the pens are ready, at 9:05 p.m. it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russian proposal to oust al-Assad
More than three years ago, Western countries rejected an offer by Russia to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to the newspaper, the Russian UN envoy proposed a plan to remove al-Assad from power in a graceful manner after a while.
The Western countries, however, did not accept the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
The Russian ambassador, Vitali Tshurkin, told him in a private conversation that the three-point plan was to prevent the opposition from arming itself, that there should be an immediate dialogue between the opposition and Assad, and that Assad's resignation should be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can have an open discussion.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, "Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we need to do", Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting
Ahtisaari says he passed on Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm to the newspaper the content of the discussion, but Ahtisaari said there are no two words.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Mr Ahtisaari's claims, but said that at that time, al-Assad's forces had already carried out a number of mass killings and that key opposition groups had rejected any agreements to keep him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East department at the British Foreign Office, is skeptical of Mr Ahtisaari's remarks, because in his experience Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point of Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke to the Moscow delegation.
If he had told me about the speech by Tshurkin, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was still a plot by Putin to keep power with some al-Assad backer.
A refugee stream of our own making
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been displaced by war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We're paying the bill we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari tells the paper.
The centre for asylum seekers in Turkey
The centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government of Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty Tower complex in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki news agency reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose the school building as a temporary solution to the ministry.
According to the deputy chairman of the Tornio city council, Sauli Hyöppinen (left), this is not true.
"When the whole council wasn't there and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter", he told STT.
36 out of 43 delegates were present at the debate.
The planning center was opposed by 13 councilors.
On this basis, a positive decision could be expected, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiaisen, the city was contacted on Monday and responded quickly.
The consortium is estimated to accommodate 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be used for this purpose.
The location is a few hundred metres from the border, so it would be functional in that sense, says Rise.
The flea still hopes for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), the halving of public holiday funds would only address part of the government's aim of reducing the price of work.
He said the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners could agree on one.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations were seeking alternatives to the government's announced blackmail of working people.
If such an agreement is to be made, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, a halving of the holiday allowance would be an effective way of doing so, since it would affect almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday hours.
The social partners could agree on the reduction of holiday allowances, since they are recorded in collective agreements instead of in the law.
The Government will present its views on the situation in the workplace next Wednesday in a communication from the Council of Ministers.
The fly says the proposals from the organizations should be known before then.
The final back line is not here either.
The legislative work will then start, which means the train is moving and it will become more and more difficult.
It's about time.
It doesn't take long to get to this kind of thing, if you have the will, the Owl designed it.
The list published by the Government last week includes the change from the end of the year and from the friday to the unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working time.
In addition, the first sick days are cut, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation beyond trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
The wage-earners' organisations are holding a rally on Friday in response to the action, and several trade unions have announced political strikes.
The Tohma Lake City Council approved the expansion of the Mahlahall warehouse.
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved the expansion of the hall, or the storage hall, of the slightly weaker Nordic Koivu Oy.
The criticism was that the project is larger and more expensive than originally envisaged.
I'm also a little bit on a tight schedule.
It was also a little surprising that the space requirement was not known a year ago when the last enlargement was decided.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400 to 450 m2 was approved for the investment programme, but the financial amount will be decided on in the interim report.
The agenda also mentioned an investment of EUR 150 000 to 200 000 but at the meeting technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it would bring jobs and tax revenue to the local area.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) argued.
The language of the Karelian people has a place in Joensuu
The city government eased its previously harsh stance to bring karay language cotton signs to Joensuu's downtown.
The new decision is important and right in view of the continuing herding tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the Karelian language because it has no historical basis and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more closely related to the Eastern Savoyards.
After the new decision, there will be no more signage in the city center in the Karelian language.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, well prepared to use the Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended by the city for all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worthwhile to be open-minded about the use of the Karayla language now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in Northern Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a distinctive feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be used to promote the county in a variety of ways.
The disruption of rail links is cutting off the province 's vitality .
The railway cuts are a major blow to the county's vitality.
The transport links have a direct impact on the economic and competitive situation of the region.
And that affects whether people can live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also mentions air transport, which has been repeatedly included in the report.
It is important for the whole region that our chances of success are not reduced by state measures, as is happening now.
The impact of these disconnections on employment, for example, should be looked at, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of transport links poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport links also affect the research community, which is highly mobile and travels a lot for research.
The University's recruitment director, Marko Junkkarinen, says that even at the moment it is difficult to market the university to Western Finland because of the weakness of the transport links.
At present, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of these, about 10-20% are from the Udelta region, partly because of the direct rail link.
From the river I became one of the voices of the war of the swine
The view of the Joensuu City Council on the provincial Siun Sode project is apparently unanimous, but there is one voice among the others.
At the council meeting on Monday, Pentti Keskisalo (pictured) proposed abandoning the whole project, but his proposal was deemed unprofitable.
The government approved Mayor Kari Karjalaisen's final proposal, which will be reviewed in early October before the city council meeting, which will give its final opinion on the project at the same time as all the other municipalities.
One train from the Eagle to Kouvola will end next year .
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, albeit with one less train shift.
Passenger train services between Kotka and Kouvola will change in March.
One couple of trains are left out, but you still get from the Eagle to Kouvola five times a day and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' purchase allowance for rail transport for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12,3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely shut down.
The VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up the roof, one didn't make it down, the guys slipped out.
The rescue team released a 12-year-old boy from the spire after he climbed onto the roof, who could not get down on his own.
The incident happened at Tornion Hill on Keto Road at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no stairs to the roof.
That did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the amateur radio mast next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped away, and passersby alerted the rescue service to help with the stakes to bring back to the surface the last person left safely on the roof.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the measures in question.
FedEx published weak results for the latest quarter, while the transport sector left its full-year earnings forecast weakened by the decline in demand for freight services and the increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it would be hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's stock fell about 2.5% 45 minutes before the actual trading opened on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May, a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
According to a FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has weakened despite price increases of 4.9% on average, which will take effect on 4 January, and additional charges for heavy or bulky shipments by land in November.
The company still expects an increase in earnings from the previous year, thanks to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in e-commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company had performed well in a weaker economic situation, which had particularly affected production and world trade.
The announcement of the seasonal workers' hiring plans came a day after competitor UPS announced its plans to hire roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90 000-95 000 people.
In the quarter ended 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, an increase of 6%.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which means the $2.44 forecast from 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research was left.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the expected turnover was $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been tested in recent years by the decline in international first class shipments, which has led to a slowdown in the operations of its Express unit.
The strong growth of online retail has confirmed the success of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29%, but the operating profit reflected higher costs for bulk shipments and insurance.
The Express unit generated better returns due to higher basic charges, while the freight business's returns decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading day, FedEx's share price had fallen by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock closed down 11% below the year's average and 17% below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the Fed's decision-makers are meeting for the most anticipated meeting in years, a group sitting on a 10-foot-wide wooden table in Honduras to decide whether it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The central bank's ornate two-story meeting room is decorated with a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the president of the central bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the financial interests of the state ahead of all other interests.
The Fed has a double mandate from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, after the Great Depression, the central bank's management has taken note of a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be missing from the fragile decision, which the central bank is due to announce on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to start its recovery from the unforeseen stimulus provided by the short-term interest rates, which remained near zero at the end of 2008.
While most data points to steady growth, the recent turmoil in financial markets may already have the cautious central bank officials scared of increasing volatility by raising the federal tax rate by a quarter of a percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are naturally the first and most important in their practical monitoring", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the banking firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in global markets will give sufficient reason to wait", Piegza continues.
The central bank is not in agreement with the thinking of the people who are considering the matter, which in itself is a source of nervousness.
About half of the economists in a Bloomberg poll feared a rise in interest rates this week.
However, in the financial markets, the central bank is expected to wait, and the key indicator is that there is only a 30% chance of a drawdown.
If the central bank raises its benchmark rate, the share price may fall unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising a second raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16,599.85.
"The upward trend was driven by expectations that the central bank would keep the key interest rate stable this week", said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this point", he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of the financial market unshaken".
The experts of the other group, on the other hand, noted that raising interest rates could calm financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank seemed inclined to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step in tightening financial conditions and thus strengthening the US recovery.
Yellen has said throughout the spring and early summer that he expected interest rates to rise this year  despite the Liberals' view that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level the central bank calculates for full employment.
Wages seem to be picking up.
Although inflation continued to fall below the ECB's annual target of 2%, the central bank's decision-makers noted that the main reason for this was the temporary sharp impact of oil prices.
"The economy can and needs higher interest rates, provided they take into account the tightness of the labour market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world were not shocked last month when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16 percentage points from its record high in May, and investors feared that the Chinese economic slowdown would also affect global growth.
The market has been buoyant this month, and the Dow Jones is now down almost 10 percent from its May peak.
The volatility of the market means that central bank decision-makers are further complicated in considering raising the key interest rate.
"The central bank's work is getting more complicated despite what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the Chinese economic slowdown in recent weeks", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he believes the central bank will wait at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy.There is very little reliable data on the situation after the recent development of the Chinese economy", Oliner said.
The ECB's main concern is not the global economic recovery, which should not, in principle, influence its decision-making.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential body in the world monetary system.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
In 2013, the mere suggestion by then-President Ben S. Bernanke that the central bank might scale back its operations caused a worldwide upheaval.
In today's world, where markets and economies are closely intertwined, the central bank is required not only to monitor global developments but also to engage with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at investment firm Envestnet Inc.
The President of the Richmond Regional Central Bank, Jeffrey Lacker, said this month that the central bank has in the past overreacted to movements in financial markets that do not seem to have any connection with the fundamental pillars of the economy.
Mr Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for the increase in the guide rate, citing the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999 as an example.
"The Asian financial crisis led the central bank to decide at three meetings to lower the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage point, despite only limited identifiable consequences for U.S. economic growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
"The central bank should only prioritize monetary stability in a major crisis, such as the 2008 financial collapse", said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest rumors are nowhere near that", he said.
"There is no reason to fear a rise in interest rates because of market turmoil", added Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it doesn't mention monetary stability.

The Brazilian Paediatric Association of Rio Grande promotes healthy diets for breast-feeding children
The SPRS Association of Pediatricians of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, has developed a dazzling method of teaching breastfeeding women the importance of a healthy diet by showing them pictures of babies being breastfed with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which provide the baby with all the nutrition he needs and enable him to develop a strong immune system.
Because of the extra energy, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 kilocalories.
A new study suggests that in addition to increasing calories, you should make other dietary changes.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet for a pregnant woman can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrises are the most watched, even though Nine is trying to get to the top of the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson were asked to do a morning programme in Canberra on the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership election, but this did little to improve Today's ratings.
The morning show on Channel Nine was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull was ousted by Tony Abbott.
The rival channel's morning show, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was broadcast from London, with weekly specials also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance seemed to be of no consequence to Australian television viewers, with an average of 397,000 viewers watching Sunrise in five state capitals and 339,000 watching Today.
The number of visitors to the show rose slightly compared with last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283 000), but fell short of last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been stretching its distance to Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 viewers, while Sunrises had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40 000 and 50 000 spectators.
In September, Sunrise has so far averaged 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The changes in the winds this morning will affect Parliament more.
Karl and Lisa are okay, thanks for asking!

A notable addition to Seven's roster was the new 800 Words series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children, drew a whopping 1,219,000 viewers.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson's hit series alone would be enough to star without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is a resounding yes.
Seven's The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1,136,000 viewers, beating out The Block (838,000) and TBL's Families (726,000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured audiences in varying ways.
The first half-hour of the new series, hosted by Andrew O'Keeffe, averaged 446,000 viewers (17.00-17.30).
At the second half hour (17.30-18.00) the audience had risen to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers in the first half, and the second half garnered a whopping 720,000.
The audience for Hot Seat was 620,000.
The Chase Australian's second-night ratings showed Channel Nine that Hot Seats will be cancelled at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to challenge McGuire's series.

The final trio thinks Sam Wood is the real Dream Boy, but who does he choose?
Did the secret come out? . . .
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed their choice of the dream groom.
The final choice of Sam Wood, the bachelor of your dreams, has been a closely guarded secret.
The three women left behind won't say a word to the one who's been given the last rose by her bachelor.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Marcos, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about their moods before one of the three was eliminated, and the women could have inadvertently suggested who would be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women praised Wood as the perfect man, praising his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity, and considering him a suitable partner for their own qualities.
When women were asked who would be Wood's best mate if the last rose didn't fall into place, their answers may give a hint as to who will win the heart of the groom.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after himself as Wood's most suitable partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been going smoothly since the beginning.
"As soon as I got home, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were a great match, and that feeling has remained throughout the program", said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah has her feet on the ground, and she's a really fun companion", Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I must admit, there's a chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay said he realized last week at a town meeting that Wood might be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this is not just a race, I'm fully invested in our relationship", Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Woodie would choose if he didn't choose her, she answered mysteriously:
"I can't say", he said.
"I like the other girls just as much as you do, and Snezana and Lana are equal".
The bachelor of your dreams on Ten Wednesdays at 7:30.

Jarryd Hay has a lot of options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hay after he moved to the United States, and several other clubs were interested in him after last year's impressive open practice day.
Hayne picked the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the pick seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as happened to the man who was on the Australian rugby team when he threw a fly-half to the team's comeback position after a victory over Minnesota on Tuesday with a score of 203.
However, Tomsula showed his trust in Hayne and gave the man another chance to get his flying skills back, and the coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula continued his line in the dressing room after the game.
He didn't just rob the newcomers in front of the other team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
49ers special editor Cam Inman reports that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the missed catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is the starting quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fan base had been waiting for another man to make his NFL debut.
Hayne walked off the field after the loss in a crash and later told 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on", Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error to his State of Origin debut in 2007, when his home field shot opened the scoring for Queensland.
Still, the whole experience was incredible for a 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a picture on Instagram of herself posing with fans and an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at an airport in Siberia for threatening to shoot.
Khodorkovsky, who openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was liquidated, and his pro-democracy work was restricted.
Four police officers killed after rubber bullets hit protesters in Nepal
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, a government source said on Wednesday, when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's supposed new constitution, including a four-year-old boy.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, less than 200 miles from the capital, Kathmandu.
District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and fired into the air before firing the rubber bullets.
He said 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive option, suddenly became so deadly.
It was the latest clash in weeks of protests in Nepal's southern highlands, where the Madhesi tribe say the new provinces under the new constitution will weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe is demanding a state of their own.
At least 40 people, 11 of them police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since August 10th.
This is a major step towards a new constitution, but it's a very sensitive issue in Nepal, where government has been centralized for centuries.
A new constitution has been in the works since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands.
Lawmakers voted on the constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and authorities say a new constitution could be approved by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde.
Within a wide area of low-lying land some 300 miles [560 km] from the southernmost tip of the Cape Verde Islands, there is a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone developing within the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The Miami Meteorological Institute also says that a clear low-level center lies between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next two days.
Google is going to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it will launch a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations that help thousands of people across Europe fleeing war and poverty.
Google announced the fundraising campaign on their blog in a very personal way.
Instead of running the campaign, it was started by Google employee Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear", Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
With the intensification of the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe, many families in similar situations are in dire need of help.
Donations are directed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN Refugee Agency.
After collecting $5.5 million through google.com/refugeerelief, Google promises to donate the equivalent amount, bringing the total to 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst since World War II, and is particularly aggravated by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
There are also people fleeing war in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Slightly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity reduction
A new study suggests that mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity reduction for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"It takes time to get mortality data", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who reported on a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
Bariatric surgery, or liposuction, involves several methods of reducing the size of the stomach.
Surgical procedures reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food by the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, but most studies have involved morbidly obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
The weight index shall be expressed in terms of weight/length ratio with a normal value of 18,524,9.
A body mass index of more than 25 is considered overweight, and a body mass index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two obesity surgeries, gastric bypass surgery and hip surgery, to treat type 2 diabetes in mildly obese people.
The average weight index after the liposuction decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
The weight index of the unoperated subjects remained at 29.
The surgical patients had a total improvement of 36 percent and a partial improvement of 28 percent.
In the treatment group, diabetes improved by only 1 percent and only about 2 percent.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides, and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgery group.
The researchers also monitored the patients' haemoglobin A1c levels, which is a picture of how their blood sugar levels are changing.
The researchers say the recommended level of hemoglobin A1c is less than 7 percent.
After surgery, the haemoglobin A1c decreased from an average of 9 percent to 6 percent.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged at about 8%.
Hemoglobin A1c is a sign of blood sugar control, but the team led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The team also compared the results of two different surgical procedures.
At the fifth year, the gastric bypass group had greater weight loss compared to the waist bypass group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), greater weight index decreases (7.4 and 5.1), and greater decreases in haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 and 2.1 percent).
The new study could not show lower mortality after five years, but according to a Swedish study by Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgery adds years of life to obese individuals.
In a Swedish study, the probability of death in obese people who underwent gastric bypass surgery decreased by 29% over 15 years compared with the traditional treatment group.
Although the new study did not find a lower mortality rate, Blackstone said it was confirmed that people with a body mass index of less than 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding of the study, as it shows that surgery is safe in the lower-weight group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease", Blackstone wrote.
Blackstone says that people and doctors should take weight seriously when the BMI is 27·30.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously", the researcher said.
"When the human body has accumulated genetic changes that expose it to obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation".
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama  RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot take in all refugees, and that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during his visit to the United Kingdom, speaking at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
The Dalai Lama said that in the current situation, humanity must be put before individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not sufficient in this situation.
"It is impossible to imagine that everyone could come to Europe", the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
The Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis, but stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing, but at the same time, we have to think about long-term solutions and how we can bring about real peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education", the Dalai Lama stressed.
"Ultimately, we need to think about how we can reduce the killing in these countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Violence has never solved problems", he added.
On violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, claiming that by resorting to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States had created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of 9/11, I conveyed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through nonviolence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Swallowing by hand quadrupled in children in four years
According to the Georgia Poison Center, poison centers across the United States report that the number of cases of children under 12 swallowing high-intensity handcuffs has nearly quadrupled since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, the number of glove swallowing cases reported to poison control centers among children under 12 increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly within the reach of children, and unfortunately some of them are in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Lopez says that children drink their hands on purpose, some to impress their friends, and some because they are encouraged by social media.
You know, there are videos on YouTube of teenagers drinking disinfectant for cheap booze.
Teenagers are reported to mix an alcoholic mouthwash with a disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Younger children may be attracted to the smell of their hands.
"The child does not think that the substance is bad", Lopez said.
"Many of the attractive handmade products have just been scented.
Strawberry, grapefruit, and orange-flavored handmade products are available that appeal to children".
The alcohol content of the disinfectant is 45 to 95%.
In young children, even small amounts can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of the handcuffs is very high", Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey bottle in the reach of children, but if hand sanitizers are often left in the reach of children, they quickly produce high levels of alcohol".
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently tasted four strawberry-flavored slices of bread at school, and the girl was taken to the emergency room.
"Her blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the level of an adult", says her doctor, Chris Ritchey, of Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah was soaked and unable to walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for brain damage because she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol", Ritchey said.
"The situation was really scary", Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products and disinfectant towels, in addition to keeping your hands out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizer containing an unreported toxic substance.
The health authorities considered that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is listed in the product information as an active substance.
According to a police report, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to kill a "rogue" teacher in January by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to gloves and has forbidden them to be brought into the classroom.
The police considered the mythical plan to be meaningless and called for disciplinary action.
Rumor has it , there 's no mismatch in Celtic 's ranks .
Griffith downplays the Celtic team's misconduct, while Deila admits that things aren't going well with the team but believes he can fix things.
Hearts are in a battle with the SFA over Neilson's suspension, and Warburton is cautious about January's transfer window so the team's unity doesn't suffer.
Aberdeen 's neck to Celtic , five points .
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty brought Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium, a win that lifted Aberdeen to five points on the way to a run to Celtic.
Griffiths is dismissing the rumors of impropriety .
Griffiths has ignored rumors of a rift within the Celtic ranks, and in his own words, Griffiths and his team are not under surveillance as they prepare to face the Dutch champions.
"I don't think we have any pressure, I think the players are looking forward to the game.
The Dutch are looking for an old Scottish fighting couple.
Former Rangers midfielder and Netherlands national team player Ronald de Boer has stated that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has ceased because the Celtic-Rangers duels are no longer available to watch.
De Boer, who works for Ajax's team management, said: "The highlights of Celtic's games are no longer shown in Holland.
Because the Rangers are no longer in the game".
"This isn't just about the Rangers coming back.
This is the Old Firm.
The Dutch are looking for a team-to-team match.
There is tremendous excitement at the Old Firm games, and they are of interest beyond the borders of Scotland".
I'm gonna take advantage of this, Deila assures me.
Ronnie Deila admits that Celtic are having a hard time, but the Norwegian forward assures us that things will change.
The team that lost to Malmo were knocked out of the Champions League, losing ten players to Aberdeen, who are now five points ahead of the rest of the table.
"Celtic have had some tough times before, and we're going to get back up", Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as soon as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes anger or sadness in many.
So are we, but we have to move on.
We need the support of Celtic fans very badly, because it's going to strengthen the players tremendously.
The spirit of community is really important".
Warburton 's cautious in January 's transfer window .
Although only a few weeks ago, Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted at January's transfer window, he's been cautious about the transfer window, saying he wants to jeopardize the team's unity.
"The January transfer window is significantly different from the summer transfer window", said the former Brentford coach.
'The players who join the team in the summer are able to get used to the team before the season starts, which we have succeeded in this season with our line-up.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can do more harm than good to a team".
Michu, who is considering retirement for Celtic
Swansea striker Michu has been linked with Celtic in player transfer talks, and Michu has hinted at retiring at the end of his contract with the Swans.
Michu, 29, has been plagued by a sore ankle for years and was unable to secure a transfer from Wales this summer.
Hearts ready for the SFA battle on Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off, and the team eventually lost 3-2.[2] The defender's red card was later revoked, the third red card Collum has received in eight months to be revoked.
But Neilson is true to his word: "I didn't question the honesty.
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle .
Griffiths was reprimanded when he admitted to playing a song lyrics that were derogatory to former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, prior to the Edinburgh local match at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming up and the atmosphere was intense", the striker said. "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except for Celtic".
The Tannadic board believes in the coaching staff at Dundee United .
Simon Donnelly assures us that the Dundee United management team can turn the situation around and that surrender on the pitch will no longer be tolerated.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're getting the boys ready for battle", Donnelly said.
McInnes happy with Hamilton's win in a dirty game.
Derek McInnes admits Aberdeen were forced to cling desperately to their seventh consecutive league win against Hamilton, with the win catching Aberdeen five points from the top of the table, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winning team that hasn't won games like this", McInnes said.
Unemployment in Scotland unchanged, rising in the British Isles
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged in July, with 164,000 unemployed, while the unemployment rate in the whole of the UK rose by 10,000 over the same period.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared with 5.5% in the UK as a whole.
The number of people in employment in Scotland is 12 000 less than three months ago, and now stands at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, compared with the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on the recent figures, Scottish Minister of State David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a strong economy".
Almost exactly one year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year, and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I watching an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there's a legal basis for the revocation, I'll be watching the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not hope to do, I will be sitting in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary while Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
I received an invitation in January from his best friend, and despite my shock, I accepted.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would tell the true story of a death sentence.
The angle would be unique.
Journalists get to follow executions in the United States, and because there are more applications than places, participants are selected by macabre voting.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of reporters from 12 to five.
The chosen will follow the execution in moderation.
I can't do that.
I'm sitting here with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've built a personal relationship with him, because we've talked on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison staff say I can't be there as a witness and a reporter, so I'm not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to take notes.
I just have to try and get the details in my head.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising the integrity of the state.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell the story of the condemned in a way that pleases him, you get closer to him".
I told the reporter I disagreed.
The reporter admitted that she could have been more careful in her words, but still felt that my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tried to tell me what to write, I wouldn't obey.
I've told him he can take me off the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to report on what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes the public will be a major force in the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is gonna be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about this, you can listen to my podcast.
I'm not going to repeat the details here.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would make him guilty of aiding and abetting after the crime.
However, I believe it is highly probable that Mr. Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence was insufficient to justify the death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this perspective, I'm watching his execution.
I can't claim to be completely neutral.
You can read the impartial description in other reporters' stories.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die for nothing.
A man was lured from Canning River after a police pursuit.
The Canning Vale area constable kept his head dry while luring the man up the Canning River.
A Perth man's escape attempt plunged him into the muddy waters of the lowlands, and a policeman a few yards away was able to get him back to dry land.
Canning Vale police received a call Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When police arrived at the scene, they spotted a suspect trying to dodge the police by heading for Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"A man standing in the water announced that he would not come out of the water and told the police to go in and get him", said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhaveci was not tempted by the wetness of his uniform, so he chose a safer tactic - a negotiation.
"Sometimes an escape attempt leads to a resort to amusing means", said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a striking example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police raid and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the stunt inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says the editors were trying to spy on him, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody is accusing the Racing Victoria executives of attempting to spy on his stables last year, and the man threatened to stop racing immediately.
Moody's claimed that the directors and Racing Victoria's corruption department have attacked her personally, and Lady Tata's recent rejection for treatment on race day was the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always been committed to the sport of racing, and Moody's been in a tough spot when he found cobalt in Lidar's sample, and he couldn't explain the finding.
Moody has kept his mouth shut on the espionage charges for a year and a half, and he didn't want the charges to reflect on the actions of a bitter man.
"I didn't want to bring it up, I thought about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration comes out in a flash", Moody said.
"They know what really happened".
"Sometimes you have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the state after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and I'm going to sleep well tonight.
I want to walk upright, and I want the owners of the horses to believe that I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe me, I don't think I should be a horse trainer anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach".
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told the FBI about the attempted espionage of his estate.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart were sitting in the same room and they offered a man a job at my ranch to spy on my activities, and I'll tell you the man's name when you ask", Moody told Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should present the evidence, because I haven't been caught doing anything illegal.
Former RVL Chairman Robert Roulston, current RVL Chairman David Moodie and current RVL CEO Bernard Saundry were aware of the operation then and now.
Should I consider this a personal chase?
Should the RVL take concrete action and shift responsibility for the situation in the sector to those other than the trainers?
Am I a disadvantage to the industry?
Am I really a nuisance to the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I'll get a trainer's license and be pushed out of my duties, and I'm sure I'll make a lot of people think that.
But I'm at a point where I don't care anymore, and that's sad.
It's really sad.
I'm pressuring them to make their decision.
My family is with me, and I can retire".
The long investigation of Lidar's cobalt scores and his recent rejection ultimately frustrated the coach, so much so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the trainer of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, who described the race day rule as ridiculous after a clay-covered leg was illegally placed on the horse's legs.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that", Moody said.
"A member of my staff mistakenly put mud on the horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and it was.
But it happened on the day of the race".
Moody's can now await a three-month ban from competition over the unregulated clay treatment that organizers have begun to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules were made by someone who doesn't know anything about horses.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
Escape from the crash site of the Cobram has been arrested .
Police have arrested a man who ran away from the scene of a motorcycle accident.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he suffered serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the man who drove the car fled the scene and did not stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to Shepparton police.
He's likely to face charges of failure to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic violations.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is making a strong reference to the rivals' fight speech.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy considers his team's criticism of the game of tackle to be a deliberate act by the two leagues in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the judges awarded Storm the trophy for the Melbourne hosts' loss in the semi-finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up the reference to the Storm after the Broncos beat the Queensland Cowboys in the quarterfinals on Saturday night, calling the game a model game and saying that the pressure in Queensland was not particularly cared for.
Bellamy defended his team's fencing game, saying they were just focused on contact when they fled.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that two top-tier coaches criticized his team, which Bellamy sees as an indication that coaches are concerned about losing to the Storm.
"This thing always comes up, and I remember Trent Robinson saying nothing about the button when his team beat us 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you, we haven't changed our defense system or our techniques all year, and for the last six weeks, we've just been investing in contact games and tackles, which has turned us upside down.
Trent's been in charge for three years, and losing might be a shock to him, because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny how the same thing always comes up at the same time of year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett on what constituted interesting football, reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about an interesting football.
He compared his team's game on Saturday to our game on Friday and found their game interesting", Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George was heavily criticized for his boring game, and Wayne said that criticism didn't break him for a moment.
Now he has a team that can play what is called football, especially his young, fast midfielders.
That's the kind of football you want to play when you have an arsenal of players like this.
He emphasized this in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play his style, and not every team has midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when the other coaches are so worried about me and my team coming up against each other that they resort to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd see us at the big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the Storm and Roosters scored more runs than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos probably played a good game, I haven't seen it, but what was the score?
Our game ended with a score of 20 to 18, and we had more situations in our game, but is that interesting football?
Or are the game-outs and the trivia of football interesting?
I think the goals are what makes it interesting.
If they mention us, we will probably come to meet them".
The Storm have a weekend off, as the team will be playing either the North Queensland Cowboys and Cronulla Sharks at AAMI Park next Saturday, with tickets going on sale Tuesday morning.
Serbian man released on $ 200,000 bail in drug case
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to smuggle 40 kilos of cocaine into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found a 100-kilogram load of cocaine on the Solay, a vessel that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Coomer in August.
Police observed Maksimovic and his accomplice meeting at the boat dock during the morning and later caught the two at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where they found a 40-kilogram drug shipment in a Toyota Echo parked in the parking lot.
While Maksimovicia faces possible life imprisonment for possession of drugs for commercial purposes, his lawyer says there is no evidence that his client tried to take possession of the entire shipment, and that he may have been in the cafe for innocent purposes.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan said there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to flee the country.
"Maksimovic clearly has connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived".
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200,000 bail, which was released.
"After reading the affidavits of both parties, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden on them", said Judge Flanagan.
"But that alone is not enough to stop a man from escaping", the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and stay home from midnight until midnight.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to obtain images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged into an online messaging service where he got another user to send him inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed the phone was gone, and she found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she scanned her phone, she found some shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
The five images were reported to the police, and when they examined the computers found at the address, they found disturbing Internet searches using keywords to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he tried to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and impersonated the police in order to scare the pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be addicted to intimidating people.
He admitted to making a computer trap, but claimed that he did so to impersonate the police and thus to intimidate pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent him the photos and from whom Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed his intent was to mislead pedophiles.
He said that he had had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "After finding the messages on the phone, the girl called out to her mother, shaking and crying".
She saw inappropriate pictures on her phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl testified that the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to communicate with girls who appeared to be considerably younger.
Hogg, 23, of Dundee Ward Road, pleaded guilty to possession of indecent images of children on June 14 last year, violated his bail on January 25 this year and failed to appear for his hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hoggie be excluded from the sex offender register, as the offence could be considered to have no significant sexual characteristics.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentencing until October because of the social services background report.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sex offender registry before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe is giving a false speech in parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell down the stairs leading to the speaker's chair earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also overshadowed by allegations by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats warning them not to harass Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the President's State of the Union address in Parliament was interrupted by loud shouts and loud cries from members of parliament.
Innocent Gonese, bishop of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages urging them not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
"The message was sent from an unknown number, but the message is titled 'death,'" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The letter warns the recipients that outside Parliament, Members are no longer immune.
The party's bishop said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is concerned about the threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings in its corporate services business.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from the faster-growing enterprise hardware and services business.
HP said in a press release that the company will record a one-time charge of $2.7 billion for the arrangement beginning in the fourth quarter.
"The restructuring will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said HP CEO Meg Whitman, who will lead the company after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than HP today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new business model", Whitman said.
"As a company of our own, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world".
Hewlett Packard Enterprises has annual sales of over $50 billion and is focused on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to enterprises.
The company, founded in the 1930's by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is now split into two, with the twins setting up an electronics business in a Palo Alto garage, now considered the birthplace of the Pi Valley.
HP has undergone a massive restructuring as it moves from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices.
The changes at HP, the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest in a shift in a sector where it is believed that merger will bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September and if everything goes according to the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he cannot return to the field in December.
The best-case scenario is that Wilshere will have to miss at least the next four England games, and given the man's history, his participation in European competitions is clearly unclear.
The biggest downside of the latest problem is that Wilshere finished last season strong after an ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former style under the new season.
"This injury is not a career threat", Wenger said.
"The bone did not heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries".
Medically, that may be the case, but as Wenger said, there are additional injuries that can occur when a player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant irregularity.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different injuries since Wilshere made his debut six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in just 65 of 157 league games over the past five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08 the team has been the second most injured team.
Wenger accepts the possibility of a witch hunt, but Arsenal believes that the injury figures, which have improved over the past season, will continue to improve.
"Sometimes the recovery after injury can be accompanied by a period of vulnerability, when you have to strengthen your body and go for competitive strength", Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he gets his body back in balance, I believe in that, and that he can continue his career the way he deserves".
Arsenal start their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then they face Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday, with Wenger preparing for a few changes to the line-up.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be the starters.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the starting lineup to replace Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the team balanced and give rest to those who need it", Wenger said.
While Arsenal is the clear favourite to continue in Group F, Maksimir Zagreb has some of the most intimidating stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been unbeaten 41 games in a row.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by a magnitude 3.2 earthquake.
It was the 10th earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned their lessons from last season's draw at Monaco and is still motivated by the distant hope of helping the team to qualify for the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge", Wenger said.
"Arsenal have yet to win this title.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm also a realist with experience.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers".
FriendsFest: A comedy series that taught us the truth about male friendship
A similar depiction is brilliant in its absence in other series, and it is noteworthy, especially when men's need to open up is greater than ever and the suicide rate among young men is at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK, and is three times more common among men than women.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is tackling the problem by declaring 2015 the Year of Men, a campaign to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the basic idea of the challenge.
A recent study of 2,000 high school students found that people with depressive disorders have a better chance of recovery if they are surrounded by healthy people.
Also, the risk of disease in asymptomatic persons was halved if they were close to persons who did not have mental health problems.
But the basis for all of this is friendship.
Today's communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content, and quick reactions are often viewed as more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitisation of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful has doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The superficial aspects of success are values, money, image, and social status, all of which take away from our inner values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship.
A video game millionaire recently stated that money really cannot buy happiness.
The thing about Friends was that it turned the focus on the show.
None of the characters in the series were defined by their occupation, but by their personality, which was reflected in their friendships.
The show was humorous, with Joey and Chandler hugging each other or watching football on their TV chairs, and we also saw Ross often missing Rachel, and it was clear that the men could relate to this, even though they didn't hold back from feeling fully.
One volunteer explained to me: "Listening to depressed and suicidal people has made it clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
The men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should succeed is strong, and it's easy to be seen as weak if you talk about your problems".
"Friends is one of those series that showcases long-term survival mechanisms.
The show highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
Through the telephone, I can offer outside help in times of despair, but the long-term support comes from a close circle of friends and family".
The sets for Comedy Central's FriendsFest are back to life, so if you're going to be at the event this weekend, you might want to take your friends out for coffee at Central Park.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship that can be.
Comedy Central is airing the entire series of Friends for all 236 episodes in honor of #FriendsFest.
Di Maria 's shot helped PSG to beat Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavan after scoring against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Swedish side Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and the evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the attack as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League campaign with a win at the Parc des Princes in Malmö on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after less than four minutes of play in the first leg, and immediately cemented the French championship, but PSG scored several goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani scored after 60 minutes of play.
Group A also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champions. PSG are not only aiming for a place in the knockout rounds, but they also want to improve their position for the quarter-finals in the three remaining matches.
Although SPG scored, the match was not a perfect performance for the team coached by Laurent Blanc, who lost the goal and was replaced by his former home team, where he began his impressive career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win and good catch gives us a good foundation, even though we still have a season to play", Blanc said.
"This is good news.
We were hungry for the win and we were able to do it, but it's a pity we couldn't score one or two more".
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after an injury, and the team had to settle for a 2-2 draw in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux at the weekend, but Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in the shadow at the end of the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger, who joined PSG from Manchester United last month, was named as PSG's man of the match to take the team to a new level in Europe, proving himself worthy of the title by passing the ball from Marco Verratt's pass to Malmö's defence and then kicking a perfect goal into the back corner of the net past Johan Wiland.
However, those who had expected PSG's crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the play-offs, marched nine international players on the field since the start, and a team with a five-man defense and two-man offense was hard to beat.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot narrowly missed Kevin Trapp's goal from the back of the net in the 34th minute of the game, and the team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into a slump with a poor finish and Ibrahimovic, who lost five points in the first half alone, was the least likely to score.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his hand in the passing game, with Di Maria scoring a goal from Ibrahimovic's pass to Wiland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored by Cavan, the Uruguayan, who was playing in the sixth, when Ibrahimovic hit him with a left-handed kick from Maxwell.
Malmo's record ended with a second goal, and only Wiland's top scorer David Luiz's close-range shot kept the numbers in check, and Ezequiel Lavezz's goal from the bench was abandoned at the very last meters.
Malmö's manager, Åge Hareide, later admitted that PSG was in a class of its own. "We played the last Champions League game last December.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
The carcasses are not enough.
A hat-trick for the people of Paris.
This was their best game".
Glencore is raising $2.5 billion in equity.
Swiss mining giant Glencore, which has been plagued by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion in a share issue on Wednesday as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company's market value has fallen by 57% this year, and it is struggling with the fall in raw material prices as the Chinese economic downturn hinders demand and strains the market.
The share price of Glencore, with the acquisition, topped the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning as the day began.
The share rose by 2,77% to 131,60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up by 0,69%.
Glencore announced last week that it intends to raise $2.5 billion in equity capital as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion in debt by the third quarter.
The company sold new shareholders for 125 pence, which is a 2.4 percent drop from Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares, representing a total value of up to 9.99% of the entire group.
The Commission also found that the Chinese imports of the product concerned were not in line with the Union industry's price behaviour.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping 's visit to Washington
A White House statement released Tuesday confirmed that Chinese President Xi Jinping will be visiting the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will arrive in Washington on 25 September for his first official visit, following President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
After bilateral talks between the heads of state, the President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a state visit dinner for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan.
"President Xi Jinping's visit provides an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have constructive discussions on issues of mutual disagreement", the White House said in a statement.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February and he is expected to stop by Seattle to meet with several US technology leaders, from Seattle the president's trip would continue first to Washington and then to New York for the UN General Assembly on September 28.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and increased activities in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon is underestimating diversity in the film industry.
Matt Damon had a heated discussion with Effie Brown, an African-American, and he said that diversity doesn't need to be behind the camera.
On Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the veteran actor interrupted Brown as he explained the importance of considering different viewpoints in the black protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"The diversity is in the casting of the movie, not the casting of the show", Damon claimed.
Brown was shocked and hurt by the allegation. "Wow, that's it", she said after Damon's comment, who starred in the film "Alone on Mars".
Damon and Brown had met with other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the contest.
"Whoever the director is, I would encourage you to think about how to portray the character of Harmony", Brown began.
"The only black character is a prostitute having sex with her white pimp".
The producer of Dear White People recommended Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors, to which Damon responded in a rude manner that the choice of the two could lead to an unwanted outcome.
When the debate was televised, social media exploded with Damon's derogatory comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in direct words: "That Matt Damon is talking to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white-ish that it hurts".
The tweet was shared over 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments come at a time when the fair representation of the human race in the media is a hot topic.
After teenager Michael Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement has gained support across the country, seeking to end the discriminatory treatment of black people by lawmakers and authorities.
In February, singer Prince made reference to the release when he presented the album of the year nominations at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", he said.
"Like books and black lives, albums still matter".
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to a question from Fow News' Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group in question should be characterized as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group based on love", the leadership of the movement said.
Damon is one of a number of entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's not clear if Damon has accepted the invitation.
The first winner of the American Ninja Warrior Series
Professional wrestler and collector Isaac Caldiero won his first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday, and he cashed in a million dollars in prize money.
The seventh season of the show, which has just ended, was the first to cover all the tasks assigned to them.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
In the final mission, the men had to painfully climb the 75-foot rope up in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first contestant to complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero was three seconds faster and emerged as the winner.
Caldiero told E! News that after a tough battle, he's still in shock after grabbing the million-dollar jackpot.
"The amount of money is unbelievable, because I have never made more than $10,000 a year", he said of his winnings in an interview with E!
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine what's next, the future is wide open".
The producer in charge, Kent Weed, told The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten was not rewarded, despite being the first contestant to complete all the tasks.
"The rules say the fastest wins the prize money.
If more than one competitor completes all the tasks, the fastest one wins", Weed explained.
"The prize money is wonderful and life-changing, but it also gives Britten satisfaction in his performance.
I don't think he's gonna stay around to figure it out.
He's just happy with his performance.
He's got a lot of praise from the fans.
Britten's a great guy, and he cares about his family.
His children and his wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win, he preferred to win for Isaac.
She also believes that Isaac would have felt the same way about her if the situation had been different".
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers have just clinched a win over the Minnesota Twins .
The Detroit Tigers are not having a particularly pleasant experience in the second half of the season.
The Tigers, one of the best teams in baseball, are now in last place in the American League Central.
But the team did it Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to get the Houston Astros feel to fight for the second wild card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit is back, even if it's just for one night, to the winning taste that has been behind the rock for the second half of the season.
"Every win is a good one, no matter how it's won", said Tigers scout Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon held his own as Detroit scored three runs in the first two innings, once in the sixth and once in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings of good play and allowed three runs.
He's only got three good starts in nine outfield games.
"I just want to finish the season strong this year", Simon said.
"It's hard to throw a substitute every game, so I want to pitch until the sixth inning".
Tigers pitcher Victor Martinez had three hits and two runs batted in, his first run since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well", Ausmus said.
"He looks good in batting practice and kept his momentum going".
The last inning of the seventh inning was the best chance the Twins had to get back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton opened the inning with a two-base hit on a hit-and-run run near the left sideline.
Right-hander Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice hit, and Simon took over from second baseman Brian Dozier, who made three straight passes before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free-throw to Mauer, and the new pitcher, Miguel Sano, hit two home runs, and he was followed by right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With two runners on the field, VerHagen got Trevor Plouffen, third, to burn two players.
Major League team led the league for the 27th time this season with Plouffe burning two players.
After Detroit had hit a defining run in the first inning of the ninth inning, Tigers closer Bruce Rondon hit a two-run home run to tie the game at 5-4.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight innings and was able to hold his team's position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed pitcher who had just returned from the injured list to the field, a man who had been sidelined for a month with a back infection.
"Of course, the start was not what I had hoped for, but as the game progressed I started to feel more comfortable and I was able to perform well and make some good pitches in the third inning", Hughes said.
After taking the lead, Hughes gave one home run to second baseman Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
The free throw from the right-hander J.D. Martinez gave Victor Martinez the first home run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 pipe broke while the team had players on the bench.
Nick Castellanos, third, got one home run, one run, but Victor Martinez burned out trying to get to third.
The Tigers extended their lead in the second inning, with the winner James McCann saving a field goal to the second and Anthony Gose to the first, making the score 3-0.
"What a shot", commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit particularly well, but the punch hit the right spot".
On the pitching mound, Hughes pitched a scoreless third inning before being traded to right-handed relief pitcher A.J. Achter.
Hughes's record was three runs, six hits, a walk-off home run and four RBIs.
Note: Tigers right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez was not on the roster due to a torn ACL.
The shoulder is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who removed Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list with a sprained shoulder since mid-August, and he was scheduled to be on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is out, left-handed batter Daniel Norris is out of the injured list and is in the starting lineup against the Twins.
Norris has scored 1 1 in four games since he was traded to left-handed hitter David Price on July 30.
He's been out of the lineup since August 20th because of a malformed gastric bypass.
The Tigers and Twins will conclude their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 RBI) is facing off against right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 RBI).
