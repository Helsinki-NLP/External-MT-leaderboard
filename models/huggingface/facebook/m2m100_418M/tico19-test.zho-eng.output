From 1 January to 15 March 2020, the accumulated incidence of new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK increased rapidly.
In the EU/European Economic Area countries as well as in the UK, the accumulated incidence of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends, confirming that although different countries are in different stages, the COVID-19 major epidemic is developing rapidly.
According to Italian experience, the country, hospitals and hospitals for severe diseases need to be more prepared to meet the increased number of COVID-19 patients, with severe diseases care tasks especially heavy.
On December 31, 2019, the city of Wuhan, in the province of Lake North, China, several cases of unknown cause of pneumonia.
On January 9, 2020, the China Disease Prevention Control Center that the pathogen is a new coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
After that, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) .
So far, evidence has shown that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, or associated with or not associated with pneumonia respiratory infections, and most can recover.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to severe and requires hospitalization, while in the remaining 6% cases progresses to severe and requires severe care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 was approximately 4%.
In this study, we evaluated the trends of the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 in countries in the European Union/European Economic Area (European Union, EU/European Economic Area, EEA) and in the UK (UK) and compared it to the North Lake Province of China.
We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK between January 31 and March 15, 2020 with Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the dynamic change in the COVID-19 epidemic in other parts of the world is similar to China.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) General Director declared COVID-19 a major epidemic.
In the European Monitoring magazine, published on March 5, 2020, Spiteri and others the first COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Europe based on the WHO’s case definition.
In the EU/EEA, France on January 24, 2020 the first three cases of confirmed diagnosis, with patients returning to the city of Wuhan, Lake North, China.
By 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK have detected COVID-19 cases, including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths from 31 December to 15 March 2019, from which only Italy 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Accumulated number and accumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases by every country around the world at 8:00 a.m. and they are only available through official sources, such as the Ministry of Health, the National and Regional Health Authorities and the WHO.
These data have been used to evaluate the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare with Italy.
We calculated the accumulated incidence rate of 14 days for each EU/EEA country and the UK of COVID-19 cases between 1 January and 15 March 2020 as an indicator of the incidence rate for active COVID-19 cases to take into account the natural course of COVID-19.
We also provide the total number of accumulated cases by 8:00 a.m. each country by March 15, 2020 and compared with data from Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of 14 days of cutting accumulated incidence in EU/EEA countries and the UK’s COVID-19 cases is generally consistent with Lake North (China) (Figure 1)
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 begins to rise from around 21 February 2020 and then to rise drastically around 28 February (supplementary material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries, as well as in the UK, has a similar growth trend (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK between January 31 and March 15, 2020 and is compared to Italy.
It should be emphasized that by 8:00 p.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries, as well as the UK, have a total number of cases equal to Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases by the EU/EEA and the UK is growing rapidly.
The observed COVID-19 accumulated incidence trend shows that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although countries are in different stages, the national public health response measures are different, the definitions of cases may be different from countries to countries, and there are different plans for patients to choose to receive COVID-19 confirmation testing – including additional testing – but the situation is the same.
At the beginning of March 2020, according to doctors from the affected regions in Italy, approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients need severe care, and the media reports that hospitals and severe care hospitals in these regions have reached the maximum load.
At EU/EEA level, the data currently available is that COVID-19 cases in hospitals/or hospitals with severe diseases are only 6% and 1% respectively (data is not displayed).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic manner to supplement the focus on the current monitoring data on the number of cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed that the number of sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (2010-2011) with 12.5 sick and medium-term care beds per 100,000 people.
The ECDC modeled the sixth update of the COVID-19 Fast Risk Assessment of the healthcare capacity saturation-related scenarios and estimated the relationship between the rate of infection and the risk of exceeding the weight of the COVID-19 bed in each EU/EEA country and in the UK.
Since cases have so far gathered in EU/EEA countries and in certain regions of the UK, and hospitals and severe care hospitals are often serving the covered population of the specific areas, it is best to provide information on cases and severe care beds at the standard statistical geo-unity 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEA and the UK’s COVID-19 epidemic are developing rapidly.
Therefore, the state, hospitals and hospitals should be prepared to respond to the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially serious care, such as the occurrence of affected areas in Italy.
As the recent ECDC Fast Risk Assessment points out, fast, positive and comprehensive approaches are essential for delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2 and require the transition from the restriction to the relief, as the rapid growth of the expected number of cases may not allow decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adjust the response.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the effects of major epidemics.
Currently there is a short window of opportunity, with countries being able to further increase control to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a sharp increase in patients in need of serious care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, leading to more than 3,000 deaths, causing huge human disasters.
Similar to its homogeneous source SARS-CoV virus – which in 2003 caused thousands of people to get SARS infected – SARS-CoV-2 may also be spread by butterflies and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are lower than SARS, it is more contagious, and older people are more affected than young people, and men are more than women.
Given the rapid increase in publications related to new coronavirus, this article wants to make a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly developing research topic.
We will introduce basic knowledge about epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, forecast and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still have to be answered, we hope this review will help understand and eliminate this terrible disease.
The spring holiday of January 25, 2020 becomes an unprecedented and memorable memory for the Chinese, with the outbreak of a new type of viral disease forcing everyone out of the house throughout the holidays and several weeks thereafter.
This virus is highly homogeneous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 eruption of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 named it SARS-CoV-2, the related disease was known as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread across the country and then spread to almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, of which more than 40,000 have been hospitalized and more than 3,000 have died.
The WHO warns COVID-19 has become “the number one public enemy” and its threat may exceed terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months since the first report was published on January 7, 2020, which involves virology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment.
This article aims to summarize the research progress in this emerging discipline.
People are used to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV—Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012).
We will also discuss the knowledge that we have learned so far about the disease's prevention and prediction, as well as some urgent issues that are still to be solved.
CoV has been thought to be a non-fatal pathogen in humans, leading mainly to approximately 15% of common colds.
But this century has encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which exploded in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and rapidly spread to many other countries, with a terrible rate of disease and mortality.
Therefore, this COVID-19 epidemic is the third recorded CoV eruption in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the city of Wuhan first several cases of unknown cause of pneumonia to the National Health Committee of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV series was announced.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan the first deaths.
At the same time, the epidemic rapidly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, medical staff infection, indicating that there may be a transhuman phenomenon.
On January 23, Wuhan City closed and closed all public transportation.
On January 24, the first clinical research report on new coronary pneumonia found that in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 were in direct contact with the Wuhan Southern Seafood Market, which is considered the starting point of an unknown animal source of infection.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the explosion as a “global health emergency.”
By the time this report was published, the disease has spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
Due to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and severity of the outbreak is still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centric study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 diagnosed COVID-19 patients) provided an up-to-date description of this epidemic as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can be infected by all ages, but the main age range is 30-65 years old.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected are over the age of 50, very few under the age of 20, and only 14 infected are under the age of 10.
More men with SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.31/10 million) than women (0.27/10 million).
COVID-19 is concentrated mainly in the northern and surrounding areas of Lake.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the occurrence to the diagnosis.
The average immersion period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from disease to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased by an index until January 23, 2020, matching the massive population flow time before the Spring Festival in China.
The diagnosed death rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), the post-adjusted death rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%)
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (man), age (≥60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large subfamily of tuberculosis virus that contains a single-justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four branches, α,β,γ and δ, where α-CoV and β-CoV are known to be infected by humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are combined with its cellular receptor vascular stress converter enzymes 2 (ACE2) and diurethane enzymes 4 (DPP4) and then membrane fusion.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cellulite; after the reproduction of the viral genome, the genome RNA, together with the glucose protein and the nucleus shell protein, forms a bubble containing viruses, and then merges with the glucose and releases the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
The results found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new β-CoV, with a genetic consistency of more than 99.98% from the 10 sequential samples collected from the Chinese Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan, where it originally exploded.
Compared to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV.
Through the peripheral electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have already been discovered in the ultra thin cuts of the upper skin of the popular tract.
Studies found that human ACE2 was a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2’s S protein is weak in conjunction with human ACE2, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2’s patient infection is less serious than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded by orf3b, as well as secretion proteins encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2’s orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenity and inhibit IFNβ’s expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional structure or sequence.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others the frozen electron microscope (cryo-EM) structure of the full-length ACE2 that forms a complex with amino acid transfer protein B0AT1, with a resolution of 2.9 Å.
They found that the compound had an open and closed composition, composed in polyethylene, and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could combine two S proteins, thereby providing evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may become a drug screening target to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and middle host
As it is known, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate from butterflies, and spread to humans through fruit shells and camels, respectively.
By comparing the system development of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the butter is considered the natural host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus has a 96% consistency with the two SARS types of CoVs from the butter – named bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 respectively.
However, it is unclear what intermediate hosts help the virus cross the species barriers to infect humans, and the way of its spread is also to be clear.
Ji and others suggested that the serpent is a viral carrier from butter to humans, which involves the homogeneous resource reorganization within the S protein.
According to one study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, believe that considering that a type of CoV found in a long kissing worm, which is often used in medicine, has 99% genetic homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2, it is considered to be a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genoms remains a huge difference; therefore, specific evidence remains to provide decisive results (Fig.33) .
The rationality of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive out of the body for 48 hours in dry environments and can survive up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 is to be ultraviolet and thermal sensitive – 56 °C for 30 minutes; etheric, 75% ethanol, chloride disinfectants, peroxide, chloride imitation and other fatty solvents can effectively eliminate the virus, but chloride is uncertain to effectively eliminate the virus.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore sensitive to this new type of virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on the immunity response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs (Fig.4).
In general, the virus is first identified by the host’s inherent immune system through model-identification receptors (PRRs), including C-type concetine receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
The viruses provoke inflammatory expression through different pathways, tree patogenic cells mature, and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis, which restrict the spread of the virus and accelerates the absorption of viral antigen giant cells.
However, SARS-CoV’s N protein can help the virus get rid of the immune response.
Adaptive immune response will soon join the anti-virus line.
T lymphatic cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce viral-specific antibodies, while CD8+ T cells directly kill the cells infected with the virus.
Supportive T cells produce inflammatory cell factors to help the above defence cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by provoking T cell death.
Body fluid immunity, including supplements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, is also essential for resistance to viral infections.
For example, the antibodies that are separated from recovered patients can be mid and MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system can locally produce a large amount of free genes, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case can lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a cumulative occurrence, is more likely to affect older people with multiple complications as well as pregnant women.
In general, individuals who are exposed to a large number of viruses or immune functions are more likely to get infected than others.
According to a study conducted on the first 425 cases in Wuhan City, SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have an average incubation period of 1-14 days, most of which 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study showed that according to the population statistics of 8,866 cases, the depilation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective isolation time according to the most accurate incubation period, which can prevent non-symptomatic infection from spreading the virus to others.
As a rule, an exposure to the virus or an infected person usually needs to be isolated for 14 days.
Should the isolation time be extended to 24 days?
Heat is usually the main and initial symptoms of COVID-19, which may be without any other symptoms, and may also be accompanied by symptoms such as drought, swelling, muscle pain, swelling, headache, swelling, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience breathing difficulties and/or low oxygency a week after the disease.
Serious people will rapidly progress to acute respiratory disorders syndrome, toxic shock, metabolic acid poisoning and bleeding disorders.
Even if there are no disorders in lung imaging, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be viral screening for early diagnosis.
A demographic statistical study conducted at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of various symptoms were: 98 per cent of fever, 76 per cent of drought, 55 per cent of breathing difficulties, 3 per cent of diarrhea, and 8 per cent of patients needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies on family aggregate occurrences and non-symptomatic individual spread leading to aggregate occurrences have similar results.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic statistical study found that MERS-CoV patients were also the main symptoms of fever (98%) and drought (47%) and breathing difficulties (55%) as well.
However, 80% of these patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which corresponds to a higher MERS mortality rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been demonstrated that headaches (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), breathing difficulties (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and throat pain (13-25%) are the main symptoms, with approximately 14%-20% of patients in need of ventilation support.
By February 14, the number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed worldwide was 66.576 with a mortality rate of 2%.
Compared to November 2002, the SARS death rate was 10% in 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic statistical study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 diagnosed cases was 37%.
A early study that SARS-CoV-2’s R0 was up to 6.47,95% reliable intervals (CI) at 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV’s R0 was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 lists the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but a lower mortality than the latter two.
Therefore, control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Collective occurrence is often occurring in the same family, or from the same party or transportation, such as tourboats.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other epidemic areas in the last two weeks before the disease, or have a history of close contact with the infected person or the patient.
However, people are to be able to carry the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and healed patients from the hospital can carry the virus again, thus issuing a warning of prolonged isolation time.
The number of outsourcing white blood cells (especially lymphatic cells) in the early occurrence of the disease is normal or decreased.
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients found lymphatic cells reduction in the white cell count &lt; 4×109/L – including lymphatic cells count &lt; 1×109/L –, an increase in the winter amino acetate transfusive enzyme levels, and viral blood disease.
Some patients see increased levels of hepatosis and mushrooms in the blood, as well as muscle red protein, and most patients see increased blood C reaction protein and blood throwing.
Heavy patients see an increase in the levels of the fiber protein degradation product D-dipolyte as well as a reduction in the number of lymphatic cells.
Most COVID-19 patients see an abnormal chest imaging, which is characterized by a double-sided spell shade or a pulmonary glass shade.
Patients often experience untypical pneumonia, acute pneumonia and acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and sexual fibrosis can seriously damage the gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocellular dysfunction can reduce the level of surface active substance and increase surface tension, thereby reducing the lungs expansion capacity and increasing the risk of lungs collapse.
Therefore, the worst breast imaging discoveries usually occur simultaneously with the most seriousness of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease found the bulbs of the upper skin cells, the formation of a transparent membrane, interstitial lymphatic cells and multicellular cells, matching the viral infection and the pathological manifestations of ARDS, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as the main standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, as higher false-negative rates may accelerate the epidemic, China began using clinical manifestations for diagnosis on February 13, 2020 (not more simply relying on RT-PCR).
Similar cases occurred during the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of history, clinical performance, laboratory examination and imaging results is essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Zhang Sum team a program using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which does not require complex instruments, using a test paper to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles with a concentration of only 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 virus copies per microliter) in less than an hour.
If verified in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of the diagnosis.
Due to the lack of experience in the treatment of the new type of CoV, doctors primarily provide support treatment for COVID-19 patients while trying a variety of treatments for other CoVs – such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV – and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments, such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, blood plasma, medications and psychological support for recovered patients.
It is even recommended that plasma of recovered patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing for the development of antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning, and may also attack other organs expressing ACE2 in a lower degree, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory disorders and failure are the main threat to the patient and the main cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore crucial for relieving symptoms and saving lives, including regular oxygen absorption, high flow oxygen absorption, non-generative gas and mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe symptoms of the respiratory system must receive endometrial oxygen (ECMO) support, which is an improved cardiovascular side technology for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
Furthermore, the maintenance of the electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of post-infectious and urotoxic shocks and the protection of important organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that an excessive immune system reaction in SARS and MERS patients can lead to a cell-factor storm.
Cell-factor storm is a form of a whole body inflammatory reaction, characterized by the release of a number of cell factors, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cell factors can trigger the immune cells to release a large amount of free genes, which is the main cause of ARDS and multiorgan failure.
Immunodepression is crucial in the treatment of cell-factor storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Toughened Laminated Safety Glass – an anti-IL6 single-clone antibodies – have already been used to treat cell factor storms.
Other immunosuppressant therapies aimed at cell-factor storm include: regulating cell-oriented immunosuppressant response; blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; Bonnar monotonous resistance; cell-factor signal transmission inhibitors 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as an immune inhibitor are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, large doses of steroid are not beneficial for severe lungs in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can cause severe side effects, especially anemia, and thus seriously affect prognosis.
Nevertheless, it is still recommended that COVID-19 patients with severe disease take careful short-term therapy with medium-low doses of corticosteroid.
At the time of writing this article, the existence of effective antiviral therapy has not yet been confirmed.
However, it has been found that Reedsive, a nucleophyroid-like substance, is effective for a patient with COVID-19 in the United States.
Redsive is a new type of antiviral drug developed by Gilid, which was originally used for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburger virus.
Later it was also demonstrated that Redsive may inhibit other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these reasons, Gilid has delivered the drug to China for two clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2-infected people and the results are hopeful.
Additionally, it has been recommended to use Baricetin, α-interferon, Lopinawe/Litonawe and Libavelin as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
After the combined treatment of Lopinawe/Litonawe, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur.
Interactions between these treatments and other medications that the patient uses should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibodies of recovered patients.
Patients recovering from infectious diseases collect blood to treat other patients with the same disease or protect healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients in their blood usually contain a relatively high level of antibodies against pathogens.
Antibodies are an immune cell protein (Ig) produced by the B lymphatic cells used to fight pathogens and other alien substances, which can identify unique molecules in the pathogens and directly interact with them.
Based on this principle, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and then injected to 10 dangerous patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, while the inflammation and viral load were reduced, and the blood oxygen saturation was improved.
However, before the development of specialty therapy, it is necessary to verify and clarify to propose a method that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, considering the therapeutic effect, some of the weaknesses related to plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune reaction and cause cell-factor release syndrome, which toxic reaction can endanger life.
The concentrations of antibodies in the blood are usually low, and the demand for plasma in the treatment of dangerous patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, the more critical and practical method is to separate B cells from the body of the recovered patient and identify the genetic code of the coded effective antibodies, or to scream the protein necessary for the virus for the effective antibodies.
Thus, we can easily expand the scale of the production of antibodies.
In China, the use of TCM for the treatment of many diseases has been a history of thousands of years.
However, its therapeutic effect depends largely on the combination of multiple ingredients in the prescription, while the prescription differs according to the diagnosis of the disease in TCM theory.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with light to medium symptoms or who have recovered from the severe stage.
For example, an antiviral capsule and antiviral capsule have been found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
In several provinces of China, 87% of patients used TCM therapy, with the highest healing rates observed in COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7%) and Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hanoi Province, only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM therapy with the lowest healing rates (13%).
However, this is just a rigid comparison, as the assessment should also include many other influential factors, such as the number and severity of the patient.
On February 18, 2020, Zhang and his colleagues published a study of comparative Western Medicine (WM) separate therapy with WM and TCM joint therapy.
They found that the time needed for the WM+TCM group to recover from body temperature, symptoms to disappear and hospitalization was significantly shorter than the simple WM group.
The most impressive is that the symptomatic deterioration rate (from light to severe) in the WM+TCM group is significantly lower than the simple WM group (7.4% to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group is equally lower than the simple WM group (8.8% to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still requires higher quality control tests, greater scope and more centers to verify.
The indication of the TCM therapy or its combination of action mechanisms and, where possible, the explanation of its effective ingredients will also be interesting.
Patients who suspect or have been diagnosed with COVID-19 will mostly be very afraid of this highly infectious and even fatal disease, and those who are isolated will also feel angry, lonely and angry.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, oxygen deficiency, and cough, as well as negative therapeutic reactions, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychic disorders.
A series of psychological reactions were in the early stages of SARS, including continued depression, anxiety, horror attacks, psycho-moving excitement, psycho-symptoms, paranoia and even suicide.
As part of public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, compulsory close contact tracking and isolation will make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, isolation and pollution on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspicious cases, close contacts and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team to communicate clearly through periodic and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 explosive information and treatment programs, and to avoid close contact with professional electronic equipment and applications.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain from hosts of animals and infected patients to sensitive hosts, and are often used as a supplementary means of antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has been working to develop a S-protein-based vaccine to produce a long-term and effective neutral and antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Antiviral vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.
However, prior to the launch of clinical research, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the body in the elderly and mortal attacks models, as well as their protective role on animal-related viral infections, has not yet been determined.
This is probably because SARS has already disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been since.
In comparison, due to the continued presence of animal communities in the epidemic area, MERS cases and aggregate occurrences in the Middle East continued to occur and spread to other regions.
With the use of extinctive viruses, DNA particles, viral carriers, nano particles, viral sample particles and reorganized protein acids, vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for non-immune individuals for SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and critical task to control the current epidemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time it takes to develop a vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic change in CoV.
As a new type of disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its complete clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can gradually recover, without subsequent symptoms.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients also have a high rate of disease and mortality.
Therefore, the establishment of a predictive model for this disease is crucial for healthcare institutions to determine the priority of services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies so far, the following factors may affect the forecast or related forecast for COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor affecting SARS forecast, as is the case with COVID-19.
As mentioned above, in a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the ages of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50.
Patients in need of severe care are more likely to have basic complications and complications, and they are significantly older than those who do not need severe care (medium age is 66 to 51 years), indicating age as a predictive factor for the end of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, men with SARS-CoV-2 are more infected than women (0.31/10 million to 0.27/10 million).
Complications and complications: COVID-19 patients in need of severe care are more likely to have acute heart damage and cardiovascular disorders.
Heart attacks are also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also to be combined with ACE2 positive cholesterol cells, which may lead to an abnormal hepatic function in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to the basic disease and may interact with each other.
Laboratory examination results are unusual: the level of C reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been regarded as a potential predictive factor for disease, therapeutic reaction and final recovery.
Some also suggested that the level of CRP is related to the severity of COVID-19 and the forecast.
Furthermore, an increase in lactate dehydration (LDH), winter amino transmissions (AST), acronic amino transmissions (ALT) and mycosides (CK) may also help forecast the end.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional symbols of heart or liver disorders.
Main clinical symptoms: Breast imaging examination and clinical symptoms time progress should be considered together with other issues to predict the end and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are an immune inhibitors, commonly used as a complementary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because large doses of corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffer from anemia bone death, leading to lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroid should be used in small doses and short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Psychic stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer great stress as they often suffer long-term isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witness the deaths of relatives and friends.
Psychological advice and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get rid of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic statistical studies so far, the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS.
In addition to replicating within the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also be effectively replicated within the upper respiratory tract, causing mild symptoms or non-symptoms in the early stages of infection, which is similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, the infected person in the early periods of the disease or in the period of depilation will produce a large number of viruses during daily activities, which brings a great deal of difficulty to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when the patient's condition is severe and most of the transmission does not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 eruption is more severe and difficult to control compared to SARS.
China is currently making huge efforts, including blocking Wuhan and its surrounding cities, as well as continuous isolation of almost all the population in order to interrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused serious damage to China’s economy and other aspects, the number of new occurrences is decreasing, indicating the pace of epidemic development is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimates are that the explosion will end in March, with the drop phase lasting for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more infectious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have developed a model for predicting the consequences of the epidemic, believing that SARS-CoV-2 could be infected by two-thirds of the world’s population.
A team in Canada that patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 both in the mid nose and throat, indicating that this new discovery of the virus could become a cyclic epidemic similar to flu.
However, with the decrease in the number of new cases, China has already shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have been effective.
Ebola virus has been predicted to lead to a million cases and to 500,000 deaths.
However, through strict isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness may weaken and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus with the human body.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Fig.55)
SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and can be spread through cough or spray, and may even be through direct contact with viral-infected objects.
This virus is also detected in the feces, thereby increasing the possibility of feces spread.
According to a recent study of 138 cases, 41 percent of cases may be caused by hospitalized infections, including 17 patients who have previously suffered from other diseases and 40 healthcare professionals.
Therefore, more rigorous precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even observers who have been in contact with patients or people infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a mask; both the use of a surgical mask and the N95 dust-resistant mask (1860s series) helps to control the virus’s spread.
The surgical mask can prevent the fluid drops from a potential infected person from spreading or attaching into the air on the surface of the object that may be transmitted to others.
However, only the N95 (1860s series) mask can prevent the inhalation of viruses that are small to 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can fully penetrate; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the size of SARS-CoV, all about 85 nm.
Since the viral particles can even penetrate five coated surgical masks, the healthcare staff in direct contact with the patient must wear the N95 (1860s series) mask rather than the surgical mask.
In addition to the mask, healthcare staff should also wear isolated clothes to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be infected through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 when he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus could enter his body through inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, the healthcare staff should also wear a transparent mask or glasses when facing the patient.
For the public in areas affected by the epidemic or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that everyone use deodorant soap to wash their hands more frequently than usual, try to stay self-isolated within the room and limit the contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet are considered to be people keeping away from the patient at the right distance.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of virus that penetrates the human world, based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS eruption, its high homogeneity with SARS-CoV on January 7, 2020 should originally cause high alertness in China.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan City Disease Prevention Control Center continued to calm the citizens, saying the new type of virus is not infectious, the possibility of transmission is limited, and the epidemic can be prevented and controlled.
The news clearly relieved the public’s alertness, and the coming of the Spring Festival, which was missed at the key node of Wuhan to stop the epidemic.
China’s disease control agencies may learn from this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more cautious when publishing an announcement, since each word is essential to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to abnormal information from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports of doctors or officials; (3) more strictly control potential epidemic in the early days rather than attempt to calm the public; and (4) more frequently conduct targeted and effective exercises to increase the public awareness of epidemic and regularly test and improve the social response system.
The COVID-19 eruption caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
At the time of writing this article, in less than two months, it has been spread throughout China as well as in almost 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak looks like a SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is essential for the control of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly than young people, more men than women, and the severity and mortality rates of elderly patients are also higher than young people.
The mortality rate for SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% to 1.44%).
Even without any symptoms, COVID-19 patients continue to spread the virus, and SARS patients usually spread the virus only when the condition is severe, which leads to a far greater difficulty in controlling the COVID-19 spread than SARS.
This section explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2's regular RNA test results may be negative.
On the other hand, patients who have been healed may reverse the sun again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of viral spread.
Given the research on COVID-19 so rapidly, the following key issues are still to be solved:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homogeneity is found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS patterns, SARS-CoV-2 is still unlikely to come to a conclusion from patterns.
What kind of animal is spreading the virus from the original host – assume as a butter – to the middle host of mankind?
If we don’t know the answer to questions 1 and 2, we can’t effectively interrupt the transmission path, and the outbreak can repeat at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analyses have proved that SARS-CoV-2 is combined with ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter the gastrointestinal cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also combine cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in the process of transmission?
Will it become a global major epidemic? will it disappear like SARS? or will it repeat regularly like flu?
Finding the answers to the above and many other questions is crucial, but it may take a long time.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice, only to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and make our lives back to normal.
People with coronavirus have the origins of the disease.
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptability have been driving the joint evolution of coronavirus (Coronavirus, CoV) and its hosts (including humans).
Before 2003, it was known that two types of human coronavirus (HCoV) could cause mild diseases, such as common colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation, revealing the destructive and fatality of HCoV infection.
The SARS-CoV-2 that appeared in the center of China at the end of 2019 again made CoV a focus of attention, surprisingly, it was strongly spread, but low-pathic compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal contagion, so understanding the origin of HCoV is helpful to us.
The majority of HCoVs are derived from butterflies and are non-patogenic.
Some of HCoV’s mid-range hosts are also known.
Identification of animal hosts has a direct significance for the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of CoV hosts in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of occurrence of human CoVs.
In this review, we review the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery, the origin and intersection of HCoVs.
Importantly, we have compared and controlled different HCoVs from the point of view of viral evolution and genome reorganization.
In this context, we explore the current 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic.
In addition, this article also focuses on the requirements for successful completion of host conversion and the effects of viral evolution on the severity of the disease.
CoV belongs to the coronavirus and consists of a group of just one-chain RNA viruses with a membrane.
These viruses have the largest genome in the RNA virus, containing 2.6 to 3.2 million alkali genes, known as the “coronary virus” (CoV) because of its coronary form under an electronic microscope.
Structually, CoV has a shared non-party genome of similar tissues.
About two-thirds of the genomes contain two large overlapped open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replying enzymes.
These polypropylene proteins were further processed and produced 16 non-structured proteins, known as nsp1 to 16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs of structural proteins, including scratch (S), membrane (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Many spectrum-specific additive proteins are also coded by different spectrum-specific CoVs.
Depending on the differences in the protein sequence, CoV is divided into four branches (α-CoV,β-CoV,γ-CoV and δ-CoV), where the β-CoV branches contain most HCoV and are divided into four spectrum (A,B,C and D).
Systemic developmental evidence shows that pets and pets are the genetic sources of most α-CoV and β-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of γ-CoV and δ-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continually crossed the species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
There are seven types of coronavirus (HCoV) infected.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are α-CoV.
Other five β-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as common colds and/or diarrhea.
In comparison, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, leading to severe infection in the lower respiratory tract in relatively more patients, and are more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia.
In the mid-1960s, the first HCoV-229E virus stone B814 was separated from the nasal secretions of common cold patients.
Since then, humans have gained more relevant knowledge through a broad study of both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that can cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, the concept of HCoV infection is usually harmless before SARS has been widely accepted.
SARS in 2003 was one of the most destructive events in history, with more than 8,000 people infected, with a mortality rate of approximately 10%.
A decade later, after the Middle East Breathing Syndrome (MERS) exploded, the epidemic continued to spread in the Arab Peninsula, and zero stars spread to other parts of the world.
2019 New HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is a pathogen of the continuously popular 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and by March 3, 2020, it has taken over 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
The warning has already sounded and the world has to be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
All seven species of HCoV have a common disease originating from humans, rats, or pet animals.
There are many evidence that all the evolution of HCoV is derived from butterflies, the viral adaptation in the butterflies is good, unpathic, but demonstrates great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic brings enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origins of HCoV in humans provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and restrictions of the virus species jumping.
This will also guide or promote the search for SARS-CoV-2 hosts, intermediate hosts and extended animal hosts, which is important for the prevention of future viral flows.
In this review, we have an overview of the origins, interspiracy and mechanisms of HCoV in humans.
In particular, we emphasize and explore a common topic that HCoV's genetic virus is usually not pathogenic in its natural hosts, but is pathogenic after trans-species spread to the new hosts.
In addition, we also reviewed the evolutionary trends of HCoV, where the increase in transmission is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenity.
In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Since the late 1930s, animal CoV has been widely known.
Before HCoV-229E B814 was first separated from the nasal secretions of common cold patients, doctors have separated different CoVs in various infected animals (including chickens, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs).
Over the past few decades, 7 species of HCoV have been found.
A brief summary of the history of the HCoV discovery (Table 1) in time order will provide us with rich information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E virus cells separated from the respiratory tract of patients infected with upper respiratory tract and then adapted to their growth in the WI-38 lungs cells cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common symptoms of colds, such as headaches, sputum, discomfort, throat pain, and 10-20% of patients have symptoms of fever, coughing, etc.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the organ development of the mouse and the subsequent succession.
The clinical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to the HCoV-229E infection, with no significant differences in symptoms compared to other respiratory pathogens (such as type A influenza and nasal virus) infection.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide, mainly in the winter with a mild climate.
Usually, the depilation period of both viruses is less than a week, after which the disease occurs approximately 2 weeks.
A human volunteer study found that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E had a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with poor immune function show severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "non-typical pneumonia", is the first major epidemic in human history to be fully recorded caused by HCoV, the pathogen of which is SARS-CoV, the third found HCoV.
The first SARS case dates back to the province of Guangdong, China, in late 2002.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reports of cases, with 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to super-transmitters, it is estimated that each case may result in approximately 2 successive cases, the depilation period is 4 to 7 days, and the top of the virus load on the 10th day of the infection.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially manifested with muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and cold battles, which subsequently showed late symptoms such as breathing difficulties, coughing and breathing difficulties.
Lymphatic cells decreased, hepatic function disorders and increased mycoside enzymes are SARS’s common laboratory examination disorders.
In addition, SARS patients also observed mythical pneumonia damage, upper skin cells reproduction, and an increase in gigantic cells.
After that, about 20-30% of patients need severe surveillance and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe patients, multiple organs, in addition to the respiratory tract, including the stomach, liver and kidneys, may also be infected, and are often accompanied by a cell-factor storm, which may be fatal in patients with poor immune function.
The virus was first separated from an open pneumonia examination by a relative of a source patient from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been committed to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was originally found that the virus was prevalent in young children, elderly people and immunosuppressed patients with respiratory diseases.
In the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, common are nasal inflammation, contagion, fever and thyroid inflammation.
Another independent study found that the same virus was separated from a 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7 percent of common respiratory diseases, with its peak in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an inhibitory throat (also known as a group throat).
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man, who was hospitalized in Hong Kong due to pneumonia and tuberculosis.
In addition to community-accessive pneumonia and thyroiditis, HCoV-HKU1 is also related to acute asthma attacks.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four community-accessive HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are often less likely to have mutations and cause high-pathological diseases. but there are also accidents and unknown causes, such as a stronger toxic rare subtype like HCoV-NL63, which has recently been to cause severe subtype infection in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively spread and survive within the human body, their toxicity or pathogenity also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases came from the Middle East, input cases were in both European countries and Tunisia, with occasional successive transmission to close contacts.
In 2015, successive sexual spread again exploded in South Korea, confirming 186 cases.
The clinical performance of MERS is similar to SARS, characterized by gradual acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute renal failure, which is a unique feature of MERS in the disease caused by HCoV so far.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 cases were diagnosed in the laboratory, with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In the middle of December 2019, in Wuhan, North Lake Province of China, a patient with polycentric pneumonia was discovered, confirmed by reanalysis that it was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an emergency public health event of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases were diagnosed worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the disease death rate in Lake North China is 4.2%, while the disease death rate in areas outside Lake North is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe respiratory infections, manifested as heat, cough and breathing difficulties.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory disorder.
Though SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the 82% high nucleic serum homogeneity, they accumulate into different branches in the system development tree.
Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic, but more infectious.
It is that SARS-CoV-2 is unsymptomatic, which may accelerate the rapid spread of the virus throughout the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with 6 other HCoVs, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First of all, the period of infection and duration of the HCoV disease are very similar.
At this point, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend for the other 6 HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms ranges between SARS-CoV and four community-accessive HCoV (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63)
On the one hand, characteristics manifested by SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in community-accessive HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild, and even symptomatic manifestations.
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe COVID-19 cases is also seen in SARS-CoV infections, although the proportion is slightly low.
Third, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 also shows the interesting patterns of community-accessible HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2’s spreadability is at least as high as community-accessible HCoV.
On the other hand, whether the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 will, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, decrease after human transition, remains to be verified.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the fecal sample.
At least in some cases, whether SARS-CoV-2's fecal-oral transmission plays an important role as in SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified by future research.
Furthermore, it is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community-accessive HCoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2’s transmission, pathogenic and post-human transmission characteristics will have a significant impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All 4 community-accessive HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another point of view, humans are also well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both sides may be the survivors of ancient HCoV popularity.
HCoVs that have caused severe human diseases and people with severe HCoV diseases have disappeared.
To do this, HCoV must be replicated enough in humans to accumulate adaptative mutations, thereby fighting the host limitation factor.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, and the more people are infected, the greater the probability it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it can adapt well, then it will be difficult to prevent its spread in humans by isolating or other measures of infection control.
Over the years, these four communities have received the coronavirus spread among the crowd, leading people with normal immunity to common colds.
These viruses do not require animal hosts.
In comparison, highly pathogenous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not yet well adapted to humans and cannot continue to spread among humans.
They need to beined and reproduced in the hosts of humans, and may find opportunities to spread to infected human targets through one or more intermediate hosts and expanding hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 community-accessible HCoV.
It is highly infectious as the community-accessible HCoV, at least right now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-accessible HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Is it able to fully adapt to mankind and spread in a cycle inside man without a host or intermediate animal host, is still waiting to be observed.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, first discussing the definitions and characteristics of HCoV’s evolutionary hosts, natural hosts, storage hosts, intermediate hosts, and expanding hosts, has some guidance for us.
If an animal has close-related ancestors that are highly homogeneous at the level of Nucleic acid sequence, the animal will become the evolutionary host of HCoV.
The ancestral virus is usually highly adaptative and non-patogenic in this host.
Similarly, the storage hosts will also carry HCoV on a long term.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural host of HCoV or its parent virus.
In comparison, if HCoV was just paralyzed to the middle host shortly or immediately again paralyzed to the human body, then it will not be well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as a source of human infection and, by allowing the virus to replicate for a short time, then spread it to humans to expand the scale of human infection, thus playing the role of the host to enlarge.
If HCoV cannot maintain its spread within the middle host, a terminal infection may occur.
Instead, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even build long-term locality.
In this case, the middle host becomes the natural reserve host.
Epidemiological data reviewing sexual analysis found that SARS index cases had a history of contact with hunting animals.
The subsequent serum positivity studies showed that animal merchants had a higher level of SARS-CoV immune cell protein G (IgG) compared to the general population.
In the living animal markets, a frog and a frog cat were first found to carry the SARS-CoV virus almost the same as the SARS-CoV virus.
No further SARS reports were made after the cleansing of all the fruit shells in the market, which indirectly supported the above viewpoint.
However, the report stated that the SARS-CoV testing for wild or untouched farming frogs was basically negative, indicating that the frogs could only be the mid-grown host rather than the natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, therefore many small mammals can not be excluded and can also serve as the possibility of expanding hosts between SARS-CoV.
All of these animals seem to be the terminal host of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent study of SARS-CoV natural animal hosts found a closely related coronavirus known as SARS-related coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survived in the coronavirus.
These puppies are positive to the SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other coronavirus are homogeneous with SARS-CoV with 88-92% of nucleic acid sequence.
These studies set the foundation for the new concept that cats are the host of the newly emerging human pathogens.
In addition, the researchers also identified a number of SARS coronavirus (SL-CoV) from the butterflies, but no virus can be separated as a living virus except for a specified WIV1.
Human vascular stress converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor of known SARS-CoV.
Experiments have shown that the WIV1 extracted from the butterflies sample uses butterflies, butterflies and humans ACE2 as their receptors to enter the cells.
Interestingly, the serum in patients with SARS recovery period can be neutral and WIV1.
Until now, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to Bats SARS-CoV, with 95% of Nucleic acid sequence homogeneity.
Although the two viruses are highly homogeneous, it is commonly considered that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and the butterflies are not the direct host of SARS-CoV.
System development analysis assigns MERS-CoV to the same group as Butter CoV-HKU4 and Butter CoV-HKU5.
Butterfly CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV infiltrate the virus using the same host receptor diurethane 4 (DPP4).
MERS-CoV's RNA-dependent RNA polymenzyme sequence is closer in system development to the corresponding RNA in puppy β-CoV from Europe and Africa.
Until now, MERS-CoV has not been found alive in the wild cattle.
MERS-CoV and its nearby coat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of nucleic acid sequence homogeneity.
Therefore, cats may not be the direct host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle East studies have shown that single-top bears are positive to the MERS-CoV specificity and the serum of antibodies, just as many African countries originate in the Middle East.
The living MERS-CoV that is separated from the one-top burns is the same as the virus found in the human body, which further indicates that the camel is the real host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also to be noted that in the camels of experimental MERS-CoV infection, the general symptoms are mild, but a large number of virus disappears is observed.
It is worth noting that the infected camels not only spread the virus through the respiratory tract, but also spread the virus through the feces, and the feces are also the main way for the cat to spread the virus.
However, the problem remains, as many MERS diagnosed cases have no history of contact with camels before the symptoms appear, which may be attributed to human or unknown pathways of spread, including unidentified species of animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleic acid homogeneity with CoV RaTG13, which is separated from cranberries.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too big that it is unlikely to determine the relativity.
In other words, unless the same coronavirus is discovered in the future, the coronavirus may not be the direct host of the SARS-CoV-2.
It is estimated that SARS-CoV-2’s middle-life hosts should be among wildlife species sold and killed in the South China Sea Fresh Market, with many initial COVID-19 cases associated with it, which indicates that there may be an event of animal spread to humans.
Recent studies based on macro-genome sequence have shown that a threatened small mammal, known as a mountainous (Malaysia mountainous) mammal, may also carry SARS-CoV-2-related ancestors β-CoV.
These new coronavirus genomas and SARS-CoV-2 have 85-92% nucleic acid sequence homogeneity.
But they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with about 90% homogeneity at the Nucleic acid sequence level.
In system development trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 sub-virus sub-systems, one of which has a more similar receptor connectivity (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and has a 97.4% amino acid sequence homogeneity.
Compared to the formation, the RBD differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are greater, despite the higher sequential homogeneity of both genomes.
An earlier study of infection in the mountains also the detection of a viral overgroup from a lung sample, resulting in a similar relationship with SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different assembly methods and artificial processing, obtaining some genome sequence of approximately 86.3% of the viral genome.
We can’t exclude the possibility of the crossroads being one of the SARS-CoV-2 midlife hosts.
However, as SARS-CoV-2 differs from the β-CoV series related to the SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from the SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and β-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 is still to be determined in the path of evolution in butterflies, mountains and other mammals.
Despite the highest sequential homogeneity found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and the transgender, the SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest full-genom sequential homogeneity.
It is highly predicted that the high similarity between the SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is caused by the triangular evolution of the selective mediation.
Another opposite view is that the β-CoV related to the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are reorganized in the third wild species.
As the driver of evolution, reorganization is widely present in β-CoV.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the researchers also studied the origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
System developmental evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may both be derived from the coronavirus, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 genetic viruses have also been discovered in pigs.
According to the report, the bacterial coronavirus known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in North America is closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has a genetic connection with another coronavirus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008) and the camellologist is also suspected to be the host of it.
To be clear, Figure 1 and Table 2 summarize the existing knowledge of the known HCoV animal origin.
System development analysis provides evidence of the historic interdisciplinary events of HCoV.
After 1890, a major epidemic of respiratory infectious diseases occurred when HCoV-OC43 was infected by humans from trans-species animals.
HCoV-229E’s transmission history is unclear.
Bats α-CoV closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
Between the two appeared an α-CoV sheep.
There are a number of evidence that supports the virus to spread directly from butterflies to humans.
First of all, humans, not sheep, may be in contact with butterflies in a common environment.
Instead, man has a close contact with the sheep.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related cat α-CoV is diverse and non-pathic in cat, while the cat α-CoV causes the outbreak of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, no α-CoV sheep was found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that sheep can obtain HCoV-229E-related α-CoV from humans.
In fact, cats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabbit virus, Ebola virus, Nippa virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that cats spread HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Or, despite the wheat α-CoV serves as the genetic database of HCoV-229E, sheep and single-top wheat may spread the virus to the middle host of humans, which is exactly the same as MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV clearly describes the spread of species from butterflies to single peak bears and from single peak bears to humans.
The MERS-CoV evolutionary origin of the butter was known in its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries also strengthened this argument.
Obviously, cats provide a rich library of viral species for the interchange and spread of genetic pieces.
Long-lived and intense groups, close social interactions and strong flight capabilities are the favourable conditions for cattle to become an ideal “virus transmitter.”
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered the single peak body for decades.
It well adapted to these camels, and the camels have also turned from the middle host to a stable natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild diseases in these animals andins a relatively low mutation rate.
It is an accident that the zero star spreads to mankind, and because of its uncontinuous spread, mankind remains the terminal host of MERS-CoV.
Compared to the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the pencil in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (if there is) is different.
In particular, the β-CoV is highly pathogenic in the β-CoV.
They may be the terminal host of the SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV, similar to the fruit shark in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 spread from animals to humans must be identified or excluded.
First, cats may be the host of SARS-CoV-2-related SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is almost the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings may share ecosystems with butterflies through massacre or coal mining.
Second, the crossover may be one of the middle-expanded hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related virus new invasions.
Humans infect the virus by killing and eating wilds.
Many mammals, including pets, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
It is necessary to conduct an antibodies examination on livestock and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may be reorganized and adapted in the third species that have been in contact with both cattle and crossroads.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the hosts of different types of animals, the three main factors in the viruses also played an important role in promoting the coronavirus across the intersectional barriers.
First, they have a higher mutation rate in the RNA copy.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the mutation rate for coronavirus is estimated to be "mediate" to "high", and according to the coronavirus adaptation stage to the new host, the average alternate rate for each point 2 is approximately 10-4 times per year.
Coronavirus has an equivalent activity of nucleic nitric acid extracts, and its removal will lead to very high variability and decrease, and even unable to survive.
Interestingly, known Nuclear-like Remdesivir can inhibit coronavirus replication by suppressing this Nucleic Nucleic Acid Extratease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Redsive is one of the most hopeful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the coronavirus mutation rate is about a million times higher than its hosts.
In addition, if the coronavirus cannot adapt well to the host, its mutation rate will usually be high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate, indicating its higher adaptation to humans.
It can be supposed that it has been adapted to another host that is close to mankind.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the single peak.
Theoretically, genetic fluctuations are unlikely to cause SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs to fail rapidly.
Second, the larger RNA genoms in the coronavirus have additional plasticity in the mutation and reorganization of the genes, thus increasing the possibility of inter-synchronous evolution, which is favorable to the appearance of new coronavirus when appropriate.
A large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions encoded to the ends of the 3' genome provide evidence of this.
Third, the coronavirus randomly and frequently exchanges the template through the unique "copy selection" mechanism during the RNA copy.
In the host of a mixed container, Chain exchanges occur frequently during CoV RNA transfers.
The full-length and subgenoma RNA of the high homogeneous source can be reorganized to produce new coronavirus.
In both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in the animal coronavirus such as HCoV SL-CoV and HKU9, natural reorganization of system development evidence was found.
Interaction with the transmission-host viruses
In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor affecting the spread between the species.
This article is a typical example of reorganization of SARS-CoV, showing evidence of the existence of positive choices in interdisciplinary events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the SARS-CoV separated bacterial spheres from humans to fruits, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through mutations of S protein RBD to this process.
Usually, the RBD in the coronavirus S protein interact with the cell receptor and is strictly selected by the host antibody reaction.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318 to 510 amino acids of the S1 section, and it is combined with human ACE2 and its co-receptors to allow the virus to enter.
SARS-CoV’s RBD can identify ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including cats, frogs, mice and cats, thus allowing the virus to spread between species.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were observed in the RBD, which separated from the human and fruit shell virus layers, of which four residues were found in the receptor combination system that interacted with the ACE2 receptor.
There are mutations of K479N and S487T in the SARS-CoV RBD, which may increase the fiber mutation protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S protein S1 units is 30%, which means that the association of the S protein with the human ACE2 is likely to change.
Indeed, a frozen telescope study shows that this combination is 10 to 20 times stronger than that between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be meaningful to determine whether any other recipients are needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also combined with ACE2, but combined with different parts of S.
Additionally, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E’s amino enzyme N and HCoV-OC43’s 9-O-ethylic sulfuric acid.
They may also explain why the coronavirus above successfully adapted to humans after spreading through species from the animal hosts.
In addition to the cell receptors, the result of HCoV’s interspiracy is also influenced by other host addictions and restrictive factors.
The differences between these host proteins in humans and HCoV natural hosts, such as butterflies, singles and puppy animals, may be a disruption to the transmission.
HCoV must deprive the host dependence factor and break the host restriction factor in order to successfully interdisciplinary spread.
In this regard, the molecular determining factors in this important field of viral-host interaction are still to be determined and indicated.
Using the latest CRISPR technology, unreliable genome screening of host addictions and restrictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 may result.
The emergence of the new HCoV: Back to the original point
The diversity of coronavirus provides plenty of opportunities for the emergence of a new type of HCoV.
In this sense, the coronavirus serves as the genetic database of HCoV.
Furthermore, rapid mutations and genetic reorganization are also the drivers of HCoV evolution and two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes may completely change the type of virus.
In SARS-CoV supplementary proteins, it was found that they could codify different ORF8 proteins because they separated the SARS-CoV-related bacterial virus, so that ORF8 was important to adapt to humans.
At the beginning of human epidemic, 29 SARS-CoV nucleic acid deficiency features were discovered in separated viral streams.
This deficiency divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered to be an adaptative mutation that promotes host conversion.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV may have been reorganized with the α- and γ-CoV spectrum, where a large number of smaller reorganization areas are found in RNA-dependent RNA polymenzymes.
Reorganization points were also found in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the popularity of MERS-CoV has experienced reorganization events between different spectrals, which occurred in the single peak of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganization events were also observed in other HCoVs, where HCoV and other animal coronavirus were reorganized in its non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial choices may lead to accidental changes in the viral genome, which is likely due to the reduction of the optional pressure on the host’s immune system, such as the virus faces.
One example of these functions is that in the HCoV-229E prototype virus streams, a lack of dual-core prophetic acid leads to a lack of full-length ORF4.
Although a complete ORF4 can be observed in the HCoV-229E-related cattle and camel virus, the cattle α-CoV shows a single nucleic acid insert, causing a transcod mutation.
Finally, but equally important, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the pressure of the hosts choosing.
After the coronavirus is infected, no symptoms or only mild symptoms are detected, indicating the mutual adaptation between the coronavirus and the coronavirus.
From an anatomical and physiological point of view, puppets seem to be well adapted to the coronavirus.
For example, the defects in activating the coronavirus reaction effectively reduce pathological changes caused by the coronavirus.
Furthermore, due to the positive control of the NKG2/CD94 receptor and the low levels of molecular expression of the main tissue-compatible complexes of category I, the natural cell-destruction activity of the butter is undermined.
Furthermore, high-level active oxygen (ROS) produced by high metabolic activity can both inhibit coronavirus replication and can interfere with the coronavirus by nucleic nitric acid extracts, thereby providing choosing pressure for viral streams to produce high pathogenicity when they enter the new host.
More pathogenous coronavirus bacteria can also evolve through reorganization, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein properties to adapt to hosts.
Therefore, the appearance of three new types of HCoV over the past twenty years is not a coincidence.
The coronavirus does not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in hosts such as puppets and camels.
They do a lot of copies and do not cause a strong host immune reaction.
This is why there are unsymptomatic carriers and causes serious cases of human infection.
The occurrence of severe symptoms is mainly due to the excessive activation of the immune reaction and the cell-factor storm, so the stronger the immune reaction, the more severe the lungs damage.
In comparison, in non-symptomatic carriers, the immune reaction has been eliminated from the coronavirus replication.
The same strategy to make the immune reaction out of chain may have a positive role in anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The interference reaction in the puppy is strong.
Therefore, at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial.
In addition, there are also defects in the NLRP3 inflammatory activation in butterflies.
Based on this argument, using MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammatory substances may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV generate.
Although it has been found to have 95% nucleophysic homogeneity with SARS-CoV, there is also a nucleophysic homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2 with a coronavirus of up to 96%.
Although it has been found that fruits and other animals in the market carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified.
Currently, clearly homogeneous with SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, indicating that the transplant may be one of the middle hosts, or that the transplant β-CoV may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2 with genetic particles.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or intentionally manufactured by man.
Due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 eruption, the coronavirus has again become a focus of attention.
The study of coronavirus in cats and other animals has greatly changed our awareness of the origin of HCoV in humans and the importance of animal hosts in human spread.
A large number of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from butterflies and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection arises from the contact between humans and fruit cows on the market, closing the wet market and killing fruit cows can effectively end SARS’s epidemic.
Similarly, having regard to the detection of multiple spectrals of hemp β-CoV that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, hemp hemp should be removed from the moist market in order to prevent the spread of humans.
But whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is spread to humans through mountains and other mammals, further research remains.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed for a long time in the single peak.
These camels are important means of transport and are also the main sources of local meat, milk, leather and pear products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to follow the practices of the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS.
In order to stop the repeated outbreaks of MERS, integrated measures should be taken in combination with other infection control measures to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels.
Because we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear, causing the outbreak of the epidemic.
Different animal coronavirus circulates in wild environments.
In particular, the variation of bacterial coronavirus with the potential to be affected by human animals is very high.
These humans have a lot of opportunities to evolve and reorganize the coronavirus, which leads to a more easily spread and/or fatal new coronavirus in the future appearing in humans.
In some places in China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the serious tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop a better prevention and response plan.
In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural hosts until the opportunity is out.
Although cats have many benefits to viral spread features, the chances of humans to get exposed to cats and other wildlife species will be significantly reduced if people are educated and away from cats and other wildlife species.
To better understand the ecological state of the coronavirus and its natural hosts, continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary, and the fact will prove that this is very useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future eruptions.
In short, the most effective way to prevent viral animal contagion is that humans should be away from the environment of the natural hosts of the virus.
There are still a number of missions in the mystery of the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if cats spread an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to the crossroads, then it is meaningful to explore where the crossroads and crossroads can share the same ecosystem.
Second, if the butterflies play a more direct role in the transmission of humans, then how humans are in contact with the butterflies is still to be determined.
Thirdly, if the third mammal serves as the real intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, cats and mountains.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, are likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, therefore monitoring and experimental infection studies should be carried out.
If it is a puppy, puppy or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or almost the same genetic virus will be detected in the natural host in the future.
Continued research in this field will reveal the path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
It is necessary to update COVID-19 diagnostic standards for “such cases” and “diagnosed cases”
On February 6, 2020, our team published the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection Diagnostic and Treatment Fast Recommendation Guide, which provides experience and expertise for global epidemic response.
However, 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease, based on the results of the research and clinical practice experience, our awareness of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to one of the opinions on the above guidelines and provided the latest diagnosis standards for “such cases” and “diagnostic cases” in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Clinical Program published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (Seventh Edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) exploded, currently the disease has been officially named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the virus had been named severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a global major epidemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick guidance and published the guidance online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted extensive attention.
But please note that COVID-19 is a new type of disease, based on the research results and clinical practice experience, our awareness of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published a total of seven editions of the COVID-19 Clinical Program between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially changed.
Now, our guidelines have received opinions from people like Zhou, who have proposed a simple rating scheme based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidelines and also provides valuable references to this global epidemic.
We recognize this important work they do and thank you.
However, their proposals need to be updated on the basis of the latest COVID-19 Clinical Program (Test Seventh Edition) and recent research.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), the diagnosis of suspicious cases requires a combination of an epidemic history characteristic with two clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis, which requires three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemic history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in communities that have COVID-19 cases within 14 days before the occurrence of the symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infections (Nucleic Acid Detection is Positive); (3) a history of contact with fever or respiratory symptoms in communities that have COVID-19 during 14 days before the occurrence of the symptoms; and (4) a history of contact with aggregate diagnosis cases (in the 2 weeks before the occurrence of the symptoms, in a small scale of contact with ≥ 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, such as at home, office, school)
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imagistic characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of early white cells of the disease is normal or decreased, and the number of lymphatic cells is reduced.
The diagnosis of cases should be based on suspicious cases and with any of the following pathogenic or serumic evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is positive; (2) the viral genome sequence shows the highest homogeneity with the known new coronavirus; (3) the specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test are positive; or the specific IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 are negative to positive, or the drop rate increases ≥ 4 times during the recovery period, higher than the acute period.
We can see that the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020) adds PCR nucleic acid testing in real-time in the respiratory tract or blood samples.
The fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) added blood sample pathogenic testing; the seventh edition added blood serum evidence.
These amendments are based on the researchers' continued work of the best Nucleic Acid Test Box for rapid diagnosis, as well as breathing patterns, including blood clotting, which increased the availability of different patterns and provided evidence of the inclusion of positive results of specific antibodies in the diagnosis standard.
Moreover, more and more evidence reminds us of not typical symptoms and non-symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the process map of people like Zhou should be updated, as they will classify people without clinical symptoms as "low-risk".
Moreover, the rating system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we want more direct evidence to appear and call on the readers to make their opinions.
For the diagnosis of "such cases" and "diagnostic cases", we recommend reference and follow the latest guidelines for the country where the case is located.
Our team will also update our guidelines in time to provide help.
Bangladesh reports 5 new COVID-19 deaths, up to a new date
Bangladesh confirmed five more COVID-19 deaths on the same day.
This creates a new high rate of one-day deaths caused by the virus.
Until yesterday, infection cases recorded by the Bangalore Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Control (IEDCR), 114 cases were confirmed and 33 were healed after a home break.
There were 17 deaths.
In an online press conference, IEDCR chief Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, there are 2 cases of age over 60 years old, 2 cases between 51-60 years old and 1 cases between 41-50 years old.
She also said two of the dead were from Dakar.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic disease.
A hospital official told the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Committee, who had been treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladesh’s road transport and bridges minister, Obaidul Quader, announced through an online video that public transport stop times would exceed the initial plan and extend to this Saturday.
The public transport stop began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Basic goods such as healthcare, fuel and food can still be transported properly.
On March 8, Bangladesh first recorded COVID-19 confirmation cases, two returned from Italy and another patient was the wife of one confirmed patient.
By March 19th, all three patients were recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more than a million people worldwide
The data from John-Hopkins University show that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide has exceeded a million on Thursday.
At least 520,000 deaths are associated with a disease caused by the coronavirus - COVID-19.
On the same day that the event occurred, Malawi confirmed the country’s first coronavirus infection and the first coronavirus-related deaths occurred in Zambia.
North Korea said that by Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization has 105,1635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 24 hours before 10 a.m. (0,800 UTC) in Central European Time on April 4.
In the United States, more than 24,40,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded, causing at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News cited data from John-Hopkins University reports that on Wednesday, the coronavirus infection caused more than 1,000 deaths in the United States.
Worldwide, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the closing date to May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians across the country will continue to receive remuneration during the interruption until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state’s state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes in favour, 10 votes in opposition and 1 vote in opposition.
Saudi Arabia has extended the night prohibition in the Holy City of Mecca and Medina to the night prohibition all day; before it, the night prohibition was valid only between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a night ban between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the residence order to May 1.
Australian shops reduce the maximum number of sanitary papers for each transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the threshold for each transaction of their stores to two packages and one package across the country, respectively.
ALDI also launched a limit on the purchase of a package on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of messages on the bank account or on the Facebook page posted to the chain store.
Buyers accumulate goods because of fear of COVID-19 so that they need self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths will also limit the quantity of sanitary paper purchases for each single package.
Before these changes, Woolworths and Coles launched a limit to 4 packages for each transaction on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
In a press release on March 8, Coles that “many stores are still sold within an hour of arrival” after the implementation of the restrictions on 4 packages, saying demand is “unprecedented”, while ALDI said it was “unprecedented” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesman for Woolworths, the sales last week were “highly rising.”
Last week, Costco stores in Canberra will also limit the amount allowed to two packages.
In order to further alleviate the deficits, Coles ordered greater packaging from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI prepared the stock in advance for the planned Wednesday special.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase stocks, but local parliamentary restrictions on truck shipping times made it difficult.
He predicts that as suppliers try to meet demand, production costs will rise and special activities will decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores will not be able to hold special promotions on Wednesday after early release of stocks.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that the stores are supplementing the stock every night.
He said that sanitary paper is a big item, so the stock is less, and, once it is sold, it will leave a huge shelf space, worsening the feeling of lack of material.
“Coles and Woolworths’ point of view is that if there are a lot of things on the plate, goods such as rubber paper and handwasher can be purchased and enough, you may not be so panicful,” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Renewable sanitary paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were no longer in stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures clean sanitary paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent sanitary paper, all emphasize that they are working all the weather and the weekend endless to ensure supply.
Real Estate website Domain.com that due to the smaller number of auctions held by buyers during a long work day weekend break, some real estate dealers will offer free sanitary paper to the first tenderer at the auction in Melbourne.
NT News is a daily newspaper printed by Darwin City, containing eight-page plugins in its Thursday newspaper, designed to be used as a sanitary paper after cutting.
According to ABC Australia on March 3, the stores were initially unwilling to implement restrictions on purchases and they said they didn’t plan to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that the demand for other goods is also high, including mask, handwasher, dryer, handwasher and powder.
Similarly, outside Australia, the UK online supermarket Ocado on Sunday night restricted the number of purchases of Andre's sanitary paper to 2 packages, 12 volumes per package.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a major epidemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the continued outbreak of COVID-19 (a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) was a major epidemic.
Although the term “big epidemic” refers only to the extent of the disease’s spread and not to the risk of specific cases, the WHO points out the need to urge the government to take measures:
“All countries/regions can still change the process of this great popularity.
If countries/regions test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people as a response measure,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned about the surprising extent of spread and severity and the surprising extent of failure.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the epidemic was “unprecedented.”
He posted a comment on CNN in February, saying, “In addition to the flu, it has not yet been found which respiratory virus continues to spread worldwide after its appearance.”
Ghebreyesus expressed similar views and said, “We’ve never seen a major epidemic caused by the coronavirus before.”
He continued, "As well, we have never seen a controllable virus epidemic before."
Before entering a new state of epidemic, the WHO in January identified this outbreak as an emergency public health incident of international concern.
Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the outbreak, "The most important thing, it is still worsening."
By Thursday, the U.S. Agency at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus epidemic is a continuous spread of 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
This eruption was confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, that January 30, 2020 was listed as a public health emergency of international concern, and March 11, 2020 was recognized as an epidemic.
By 10 April 2020, a total of about 161 million cases of COVID-19 were in 210 countries and regions around the world, with approximately 9,7 million deaths.
A total of 36.4 million people were healed.
The death rate in China is about 4%, while the death rate in various regions of the world is between 0.08% (New Zealand) and 13.04% (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing and breathing.
And may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The incubation period varies from the patient's contact to the disease's occurrence of 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
There are no vaccines or special anti-virus treatments yet.
Preventive measures recommended include hard washing of hands, covering the mouth during coughing, keeping a safe distance with others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspicious people.
The official authorities of the country have taken response measures such as travel restrictions, isolation, night ban, workplace hazard control and facility closure.
The epidemic led to a serious impact on the global socioeconomy, with sports, religious, political and cultural activities being delayed or cancelled, and panic shopping increased the large-scale supply shortage.
In 193 countries and regions around the world, national or local stops are implemented, with about 99.4% of high school and high school students affected.
As false viral information spreads online, there have been hostilities and discrimination against Chinese people, other Eastern and Southeast Asian blood and appearance groups, as well as serious epidemic groups.
However, the decrease in travel and the closure of heavy industries led to a decrease in the air pollution index and a decrease in carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, China’s Wuhan (Hong Kong Province) health department a series of unknown causes of pneumonia cases and began an investigation in early January 2020.
The majority of these cases are related to the China Southern Seafood wholesale market, so the new coronavirus is considered a human animal disease.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new detected virus that is closely linked to the coronavirus, the coronavirus and the SARS-CoV. The first detected patient was confirmed to be sick on 1 December 2019 and has no clear connection with a series of cases of the South China Sea Fruit Market.
In these early cases in December 2019, two-thirds of these cases were confirmed to be related to the China-South Sea Fruit Market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning newspaper published an unconfirmed report that the first case may date to November 17, 2019, the patient is a 55-year-old man, from Hokkaido province.On February 26, 2020, according to the World Health Organization report, China's new reporting cases declined, but Italy, Iran and South Korea's new reporting cases suddenly increased, the number of new reporting cases outside China for the first time exceeded within the territory.
There may be a number of unregistered cases, especially mild cases.
As of February 26, relatively few adolescent cases were, with only 2.4 percent of worldwide adolescent cases aged 19 and below.British Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Wallace estimates that about 60 percent of the population in the UK needs to be infected with the new coronavirus to get effective group immunity.
The number of cases refers to the number of people who have received the COVID-19 test and confirmed the test results as positive according to the official scheme.
By March 23, the number of countries in the world who received the test was less than 3% of the total population, and many countries also published official policies for non-tests, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 pointed out that by January 23, China estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infected people were undetected, while these unrecorded infected people were 79% the source of the recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, the actual number of infections in Italy is far above the number of cases.
The basic infection number (R0) for COVID-19 was initially estimated between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control shows that R0 may be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients can recover.
The period of patients who cannot recover from disease to death is 6-41 days, 14 days the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 9,7 million people died from COVID-19.
As of February 5, approximately 80% of deaths in China were people over the age of 60 and 75% of deaths were accompanied by basic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.COVID-19 deaths official statistics usually indicate that the results of the new coronavirus test were positive to deaths.
The actual COVID-19 deaths may be far beyond the statistics, as the data may not include patients who have not been tested, such as those who have died at home, hospitals, and so on.
Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is 4-5 times the number of deaths from the official new coronavirus pneumonia.
A spokeswoman at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said: "We know [published deaths] are lower than the actual numbers," and rumors about the U.S. data are underestimated also confirmed this statement. underestimates are common in epidemic areas, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
On February 1, the first cases of death outside of China appeared in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first cases of death outside of Asia appeared in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have occurred in Iran, South Korea and Italy outside of China.
By March 13, more than 40 countries and regions have deaths on other continents than Antarctica.
These numbers vary from region to region, and change from time to time, and are influenced by population characteristics such as testing, quality of the health system, treatment schemes, the time of the epidemic's first outbreak and age, gender and general health.
According to statistics from John Hopkins University, by 10 April 2020, the global disease death rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The mortality rate in different regions is also different.
In China, the estimated mortality rate has decreased from 17.3% (patients from 1 January to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (patients from 1 February 2020). other measurement criteria include case mortality (CFR) and infectious mortality (IFR), the first representing the percentage of the diagnosed deaths, the latter representing the percentage of the diagnosed deaths (including the diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process of solving a specific population from infection to case.
Many scientists try to calculate the above data for a specific population.
According to the University of Oxford Circular Medical Center, the total infection death rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The estimated limit for this range is in accordance with the first random test of COVID-19 in Germany, as well as a statistical analysis of the impact of the test on the estimated value of CFR.
The World Health Organization says the epidemic is controllable.
The peak and final duration of the explosion are unclear and vary according to the region.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University notes: “If it is not controlled, the outbreaks of infectious diseases usually enter a stagnation period after the existing hosts are over and then begin to tend to relieve.
But it is almost impossible for us to reasonably predict when the turning point will occur.
China’s senior medical adviser, Zhang Nanjing, said if all countries mobilize and adopt the World Health Organization’s recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus, then “the end of the epidemic in June is expected.”
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "can repeat explosions, lasting one to two years."
A study conducted by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of Technology shows that "for the use of the vaccine (may take 18 months or longer) it is necessary to take physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner from the University of Vanderburg said: "This coronavirus is highly contagious and I think it is unlikely to disappear completely," "it may evolve into a seasonal disease, which explodes once a year."
The pathogenicity of the repeated outbreak depends on the group’s immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some infected people may not have any symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and drought (68%).
More unusual symptoms include fatigue, respiratory fluid, loss of smell, breathing, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, coldness, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or swelling. According to the World Health Organization, approximately a sixth of patients become severe and experience breathing difficulties.
The American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) lists breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden awareness confusion, difficulty awakening and face or lips bleeding as emergency symptoms; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to take immediate treatment. further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory disorder syndrome, dementia, infectious shock and death.
Some infected people may have no symptoms, no clinical manifestations, but the test results are positive, so researchers recommend closely monitoring and examination of the diagnosed patient’s close contact to eliminate the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the percentage of non-symptomatic infections varies from extremely low to 44%.
The depilation period (the interval of time from infection to disease) is usually 1-14 days; 5 days are the most common. on uncertainty, it can be explained by an example: the percentage of patients with COVID-19 loss of smell is initially estimated to be 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Some details about the path of the disease spread are not yet established.
Currently it is believed that the disease is mainly spread through close-range contact as well as the bubble that occurs when coughing, spotting or speaking; close-range contact means within the interval of 1-2 meters (3-6 feet).
Studies found that non-covered coughing could lead to the most distant spread of the bubble from 4.5 meters (15 ft) to 8.2 meters (15-27 ft).
Some suggest that the bubble that people produce when they speak can stay in the air for a longer time and also lead to the virus's spread. Although the virus is often unable to spread through the air, people may also produce bubble when they breathe or speak.
This bubble may fall into the mouth of the people around, and even be swallowed into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as tubular and cardiovascular recovery (CPRs) may blur the respiratory secretions, resulting in the transmission of air.
Additionally, if a person touches the virus-infected surface (including the skin) and then touches the mouth of his eye, it can also lead to the virus’s spread.
Some are concerned that the virus may spread through the feces, but this risk is considered lower.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 feces, which is most infectious in the first three days after the disease, but is also infectious before and after the disease.
Positive results can be detected first three days before the start of the disease, which indicates that the coronavirus is already infectious before the manifest symptoms occur.
Despite the few cases of non-symptomatic diagnosis in the laboratory, some countries have discovered the phenomenon of non-symptomatic infection in the process of contact tracking investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) said that although the transmission of the new coronavirus is not completely clear, one person in general can infect 2-3 people.
Specifically, the known new coronavirus can survive up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, on paper can survive one day, on copper can survive up to four hours.
However, its survival time is also influenced by moisture and temperature. Currently there have been cases of positive COVID-19 detection in pets and other animals.
There is currently no evidence that animals can reinfect the virus to humans, but official authorities in the UK still recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, just like contact with other surfaces that may have been touched by the infected.
Serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of virus, first separated from three patients with pneumonia in a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in the coronavirus in nature.The virus can be destroyed by domestic soap before it enters the human body, as soap can dissolve the virus's protective cysts.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Currently, it is considered a human animal disease.
Genetic analysis shows that this coronavirus is genetically associated with β coronavirus from the subfamily of Sarbecovirus (B) and the group of two viral sources.
The coronavirus and other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) are consistent at 96% on the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that the viruses and the viruses in the mountainous body missed only one amino acid in some parts of the genome sequence.
Until now, a total genome comparison found that up to 92% of the genetic substance between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 was the same, and it was not enough to prove that the coronavirus was the middle host.
If the virus is infected, it can be initially diagnosed based on the symptoms, but in the end it is still necessary to be diagnosed by reversed polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT image of the infected secretion.
A PCR and CT comparison study conducted in Wuhan showed that CT is clearly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many image characteristics are associated with other pneumonia and disease development processes.
By March 2020, the American Radiation Society recommended that "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as the first diagnosis of the disease."
The World Health Organization has now announced several Nucleic Acid Testing Programs for SARS-CoV-2, the first program published on January 17.
Nucleic acid testing is based on real-time reversal polymen chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory sample or blood sample can be used for testing.
The results can usually be found within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this detection can be done through a nasal scraper and can also be done through a scraper.Many laboratories and companies are developing serum tests for the detection of antibodies.
By April 6, 2020, any of these testing methods were not confirmed sufficiently accurate and were not approved for widespread use.
In the United States, Cellex’s blood serum testing has been approved and only for accredited laboratory use in emergency cases.
The typical image characteristics of the patient’s X-files and computer breakdown scans (CTs) include the out-of-the-country glass shade unparallel and the non-pneumonia.
The Italian Society of Radiation is preparing an international online database for the image performance of the diagnosed cases.
Due to the combination with other viral infections (such as the adenovirus), unconfirmed images are limited to the specificity of COVID-19 identification.
A large study in China compared breast CT results to PCR results found that although the image is less specific to identify infection, it is faster and more sensitive to detection, so it can be considered to be a means of screening as a popular area.
Currently, an artificial intelligence-based bulking neuron network has been developed, which can be combined with X and CT to detect the image characteristics of the virus.
The measures to prevent the spread of the disease include good personal health habits, hard washing hands, avoiding not washing hands directly touching the mouth of the eye, coughing or spraying, covering the mouth with a paper towel, and throwing the paper towel directly into the rubber.
Suspects infected should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.
It is also recommended to take measures to keep physical distances to prevent the virus from spreading.Many governments have restricted or recommended to avoid returning to countries and regions affected by the epidemic in unnecessary circumstances.
However, the virus has now reached a community spread stage in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, and some inhabitants of the community do not know where or how they are infected.The medical staff in contact with suspicious people should take standard preventive measures, contact preventive measures and eye protection.Tracking contact is an important means for the health regulatory authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The government’s use of mobile location data for tracking purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations, including Amnesty International, have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this surveillance.
There are currently various mobile apps that have been introduced or proposed for voluntary use, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts are committed to researching solutions with privacy protection features, such as using Bluetooth to record the distance between users and other phones.
Once users have been in close contact with patients with positive COVID-19 test results, they will receive information reminders that the wrong speech about prevention of infection continues to spread; such as washing the nose and washing the mouth with mouth washing is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, but many organizations are actively developing and developing.
It is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease through hard washing hands.
The American Centers for Disease Control recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there is clear pollution after the toilet or on the hands, before meals, and after swelling, coughing, or spraying.
This is due to the fact that the virus, before entering the human body, can destroy its protective membrane by using domestic soap and thus play the role of killing the virus.
The American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that if there is no soap and water from the surrounding area, you can use at least 60% alcohol-containing handwashers.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
The surface of the object can be used with a variety of solution disinfection (disinfection can work within a minute on the surface of stainless steel), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% ethanol, 0.1% sodium chloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polypropylene.
Other solutions (such as benzochloride and chlorogenic glucose acid) are poorly effective.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends that if a new type of coronavirus pneumonia is suspicious or diagnosed in an office or daycare facility, disinfect all areas, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices, such as tablets, touchscreen, keyboards, remote controls, and the patient’s automatic payment machine.
The health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth with a curved handheld or paper towel when they have a cough or swallow, and immediately treat all polluted paper towel.
It is recommended that suspects are wearing medical surgical masks, as wearing the masks can reduce the amount of bulbs that are called when speaking, spraying, and coughing, and reduce the spread distance.
The World Health Organization has published a description of the use and methods of the mask.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, says: “Masking reduces the tendency of people to touch the face, and face touch is also a major source of infection when hand hygiene is not available.”
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people only wear masks in high-risk areas, such as those who take care of COVID-19 patients, but the organization also acknowledges that masks help prevent face touch.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends non-medical clothes, but China clearly recommends that healthy citizens also wear single-sex medical clothes, especially when they are in close contact with others within a range of 1m (3 ft).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a mask when travelling by public transportation or entering crowded places.
Thai health officials advise people to make their own masks and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly prohibited from wearing a mask or covering the mouth into public places.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a mask to access public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ruled that everyone who enters food stores should wear a mask.
Israel requires all inhabitants to wear masks in public places.
China Taiwan has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, and on April 1 begins requiring that the masks must be worn on train and intercity buses.
Panama rules outdoors must wear a mask, and it is recommended that inhabitants who do not buy a mask make a mask themselves.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infectious prevention measures relating to keeping social distances (also known as keeping physical distances) are intended to reduce the close contact between people, thus slowing the spread of the disease.
Measures include isolation; travel restrictions; interruption of school, interruption of work, and closure of athletes, theatres or shopping centers.
The measures that individuals can take to maintain social distances include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding entering crowded areas, changing non-contact salutations, and keeping physical distances with others.
Nowadays, many governments have forced or recommended to keep social distances in the areas affected by the epidemic.
On the size of the massive gathering, the U.S. government agencies and health organizations initially recommended 250 people (in areas without COVID-19 spread), then quickly decreased to 50 people and later decreased to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gathering of more than two people. Elderly people and groups with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and immune system damage are at high risk of severe diseases and complications. The German Disease Control Center recommends that people living in the epidemic areas do not leave as far as possible. At the end of March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began to replace the saying of "matching physical distance" in order to clarify the aim of reducing physical contact whileining social contacts, including virtual and remote contacts.
The use of the phrase "to keep a social distance" contains the meaning of requiring people to be completely isolated from society, not encouraging people to maintain relationships with people in other ways. some authorities also published guidelines for sexual health applied during the epidemic.
The recommendations include having sex only with a partner who lives together and has no viral or symptomatic infection.
COVID-19 is recommended to identify patients and suspicionally infected persons for self-isolation.
The health agencies have published a detailed description of proper self-isolation.Many governments have forced or recommended all inhabitants of the epidemic area to self-isolate.
They also issued the strictest self-isolation instructions to high-risk populations.
If patients who may have been exposed to COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region that has spread on a large scale, it is recommended to isolate themselves for 14 days from the last possible time of exposure to the virus.
Epidemic control strategies include suppression/depression and relief.
The restriction applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim to track and isolate the infected, while taking other preventive and vaccination measures to prevent the disease from spreading to other populations.
If it is not possible to stop the spread of the disease, it is necessary to move to the relief phase: to take measures to slow the spread of the disease and to reduce the impact of the disease on the health system and society.
Restrictions and relief measures can be taken simultaneously.
Depression requires more extreme preventive measures to reverse the epidemic situation by reducing the basic number of reproductions to less than 1. control of the outbreaks of infectious diseases is part of the work to strive to reduce the epidemic peak, which is the known epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of the collapse of healthcare systems and takes more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that can control the epidemic include individual preventive measures, such as keeping hands sanitary, wearing masks and self-isolation; community measures aimed atining physical distance, such as school stops and abolition of large-scale gathering activities; community actions aimed at encouraging acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleansing.
Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass-scale screening and local isolation measures, and has issued warnings on the activity trails of the infected.
Singapore provides financial support for self-isolation infected people and imposes huge penalties on those who refuse self-isolation infected.
China Taiwan has increased the production of masks and imposed penalties on the suppliers of medical supplies for sale. Simulations on the UK and the United States show that relief (lowering but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and depression (reversing the spread of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
The best relief policy may reduce the highest demand for health care by 2/3 and decrease the number of deaths by half, but it will still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and a collapse in the health system.
Depression may be a preferred measure, but it is necessary to maintain until the virus stop spreading in the crowd (or until the vaccine is launched to the first person), otherwise, once the relief measure, the spread will rebound rapidly.
Long-term interventions aimed at suppressing major epidemics will result in social and economic costs.
No specific anti-virus drugs for COVID-19 have yet been approved, but research and development is still ongoing, including testing on existing drugs.
Taking prescription-free cold medications, supplements and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxotherapy, vein transmission and respiratory support may be required.
Using steroids may cause the situation to worsen.
A number of compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being investigated to determine whether they are suitable for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also notes that some “traditional and family therapies” can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization notes that improving treatment capabilities and adjusting medical systems to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients are the basic response to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization European Regional Office have published guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources on multiple levels, including concentrating laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating selective procedures as far as possible, separating and isolating COVID-19-positive patients, and improving the capacity of serious surveillance by training staff and increasing the number of available respiratory and hospital beds.
The speculation of the origin of the first case (i.e. the so-called zero patient) is different.
The first known case of new coronavirus pneumonia may date from 1 December 2019 in Lake North Wuhan, China.
In a month, the number of new coronavirus cases in Lake North has increased gradually.
These patients are mostly related to the China Sea Fruit wholesale market, the market also sells living animals, a theory that the new coronavirus is derived from some of the animals; or in other words, it is derived from humans and animals who suffer from the disease. on December 26, the doctors of the Central and Western Medical Association of the Hanoi province of Hanoi first discovered and treated a group of unknown causes of pneumonia patients, and on December 27, it was to the Prevention and Control Center of diseases in the Hanoi district of Wuhan.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center Hospital told their colleagues to be alert to a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight doctors, including Li Wen, were warned by the police for the dissemination of the “songs,” while another doctor Even was warned by his senior officer for the alarm.
The Wuhan City Health Committee subsequently issued an announcement on December 31 and submitted it to the World Health Organization.
After Wuhan’s health department received reports of many unknown causes of pneumonia, an investigation was launched in early January, when the epidemic began, the number of cases approximately doubled every seven and a half days.

In Australia, major behavior contractors offer new opportunities to sell Australian products to China.
This activity led to a deficiency in some supermarket baby formula milk powder, which was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Although COVID-19 was very severe in Northern Italy and Wuhan, there was no severe food deficiency in both countries.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of critical products and illegal trade are very successful, avoiding the serious food deficiency, while Europe and North America are expected to have such problems.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not dropped significantly, but industry representatives believe prices may rise.
The discharge of food warehouses is just a temporary occurrence, and even in Wuhan, Chinese government officials also released pig meat reserves to ensure the full nutrition of the residents.
Italy also has similar laws that require food producers to supply reserve for such emergencies.
The global economic damage has had an impact on China: A media report on 16 March that two months before 2020, under the influence of the government’s epidemic control measures, the Chinese economy has suffered a huge impact, with retail sales falling by 20.5%.
Since China is the main economic and manufacturing center in the world, the virus is considered a major threat to global economic stability.
According to the Economist intelligence group Agathe Demarais predicts that the market will remain unstable until a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of this eruption on global economic growth could exceed the epidemic of 2002-2004.
A specialist from the University of St. Louis Washington estimates that the epidemic’s impact on the global supply chain will be more than $300 billion, which may last for up to two years.
According to the report, due to China’s decline in demand, the OPEC’s “situation is difficult” after oil prices have dropped dramatically.
On 24 February, a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside the mainland of China led to a global stock market decline.
On February 27, the public worried about the new coronavirus epidemic, including the NASDAQ 100 Index, the Standard Pul 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, with the highest fall since 2008, indicating a fall of 1,191 points, the highest one-day fall since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three major indicators fell more than 10 percent per week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but still retains negative prospects.
People's concerns about the new coronavirus led to the stock market rebound, with the highest fall on March 16.
Many view economic recession as a likely event.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central banks and states to take urgent measures in time.
Compared to the 2008 financial crisis, the central bank reacted faster.
Closing public places, such as travel prohibitions, tourist attractions, and government recommendations to avoid the impact of travel, tourism has become one of the most affected industries.
Due to this, many airlines canceled flights due to a decline in demand, including British Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and Australia Airlines, while British branch airline Flybe unfortunately collapsed.
The serious damage to the cruise industry is more unprecedented.
Several train stations and shipping ports were also forced to be closed.
The epidemic coincides with the spring season, which was an important tourist season because of the Chinese spring holiday.
The state and local governments cancelled a series of events that would involve crowd gathering, including the annual Spring Festival, and private also closed shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many calendar New Year events and tourist attractions (including the Beijing Palace and traditional temples) have been cancelled and closed in order to prevent massive gathering.
Of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous districts, 24 have extended New Year’s holidays to 10 February, requiring most not to return to work before that date.
The GDP in these regions accounts for 80 per cent of the country, and the export accounts for 90 per cent.
China Hong Kong will raise the level of infectious disease response to the highest, and announce an emergency, schools cease until March, New Year celebrations are cancelled. retail industry is affected globally, shortened or temporary closure of stores.
Retail stores in Europe and Latin America have decreased by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, retail stores have dropped 50-60 percent.
In addition, the epidemic also led to a 33-43% decrease in traffic in shopping centers in March compared to February.
Shopping centers around the world have taken additional measures such as increasing health facilities, installing heat scanners to measure the body temperature of the buyer, and canceling some activities.The United Nations Latin American Economic Committee estimates that the economic recession caused by the epidemic could lead to more than 1.4 million to 2.2 million people in Latin America than when the epidemic did not occur.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people were unemployed in China during the Wuhan epidemic.
China has 300 million farm workers, many of whom are staying in domestic provinces or Lake North provinces.March 2020, more than 10 million Americans were unemployed and requested government aid.
According to the estimates of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, the new coronavirus epidemic could lead to unemployment in the U.S. of 47 million people, with unemployment rates rising to 32%.The blockade in India has led to tens of millions of (day-payed) Indian farmers unemployment.The Angslide Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian families experienced some form of unemployment.Since the blockade was implemented in Spain in mid-March 2020, 900,000 workers have been unemployment.
In the second half of March, four million French workers applied for temporary unemployment aid and one million British workers applied for general benefits.
France and Britain also adopted the German shortened work compensation system.
The acting and cultural industries are also seriously damaged by the epidemic, and organizational operations globally, as well as employed employees and individuals, have failed to survive.
Organizations of the art and cultural industry strive to maintain their mission (usually funded by the government), to show cultural heritage to the community, to preserve the security of their employees and the public, and to support the artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, workshops and other cultural institutions around the world will be closed unlimited and original exhibitions, events and performances will be forced to be cancelled or delayed.
The epidemic has recently also led to a number of religious services, major sports activities and other social activities (such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows) being forced to be cancelled, and this negative impact will rapidly exacerbate.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebration that will be held in Rome in the last week of the Christian Quarter Ramadan.
Many parishes recommend that older Christians stay at home and don’t have to attend the Mass on Sunday; some churches hold worship ceremonies via radio, live or television, and some churches allow worship in the car.
Because the Roman Catholic Authority closed its small churches, there were no traces of Christian pilgrims on St. Peter's Square, and other religious groups cancelled or restricted worship or limited public assemblies in churches, mosques, Jewish churches, temples and monasteries.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the epidemic-affected areas, and the Holy Place of Prayer was forced to be closed later, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their inhabitants from entering the Holy Place of Mekka and Medina.
This major epidemic has caused the worst damage to the World Sports Agenda since World War II.
Most major sports events were forced to be cancelled or delayed, including the 2019-20 European Champions League, the 2019-20 English Super League, the 2020 European Champions League, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 American Hockey Federation season.
The explosion disrupted the program for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was planned to be held at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will "reorganize to the end of 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021."
This resulted in many gamblers switching to online gambling, with several online gambling sites reporting that their new registration rates were significantly increased. entertainment industry was also affected and various music groups suspended or cancelled touring concerts.
Many major theatres, such as the Broadway Theatre, have also suspended all performances.
Some artists also try to continue to create and share works through the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as live shows, or create a network of festivals for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works.
On the internet, many of the web mines on the theme of the new coronavirus are spreading, and in the moment of uncertainty spreading, many people begin to turn to a way of reacting with humor and transferring attention.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, predictions, alienism and racial discrimination against Chinese, Eastern Asian and populations from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries have increased.
In many countries and regions, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific, there have been fears, suspicions and hatred.
Many reports in February of this year (when the majority of cases remained limited to China) recorded the racist emotions of different groups around the world towards the Chinese, believing that the Chinese should be infected with the virus or receive the so-called legitimate repentance.
Some African countries have also seen an anti-China emotional rise.
Many inhabitants in Wuhan and Lake North are to be geographically discriminated.
Whether online or online, there is a voice that supports the Chinese people and the inhabitants of severe areas of the epidemic.
As the epidemic spread to other hotspots, Italy becomes the first country in Europe with severe COVID-19 outbreak, and the population from the country may also be influenced by suspicion and hostility.Malicia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and other countries have initially signed a petition calling for a prohibition of Chinese entering their country in order to try to prevent the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the topic #ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese Don't Come to Japan) was broadly spread on Twitter.
Chinese people, as well as other Asian people in the UK and the U.S. report that racial abuse and attacks are increasing.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the new coronavirus "China virus" and critics believe his statements have racial discrimination and anti-China tendencies.
Ukrainian protesters attacked buses from Wuhan to New Sanzari, including Ukrainian and foreign refugees.
Students from the northeastern part of India (border with China) and studying in India’s major cities are also to be harassed by the new coronavirus.
Indian People's Party West Bangladesh President Dillip Gosh said the Chinese destroyed nature, "So God wants to repent them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in the Calcutta, calling it “missible.” in China, non-Chinese inhabitants suffered hostile psychology and racial discrimination also worsened due to the major epidemic, foreigners described as “foreign waste” and should be the target of “the waste processing”.
Many newspapers with paid walls cancelled the limitation of paid walls for some or all reports about the new coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers publish some epidemic-related scientific papers.
Some scientists choose to quickly share their research results on pre-printed web servers like bioRxiv.

The 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus laboratory testing methods include: detecting whether the virus exists and whether antibodies are produced after infection.
RT-PCR can detect the coronavirus’s RNA and thus determine whether there is a virus in the sample.
This test is a specific test of the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It can be used to determine if you have been infected recently or if there is an active infection.
Antibiotic testing (serum testing) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibiotic tests show how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with slight symptoms without reporting or without symptoms.
This test results can determine the accurate mortality rate of the disease, as well as the group immunity level in the population.
Due to the limited number of detections, no country/region will be able to provide reliable data on the epidemic of the virus in its population by March 2020.
By March 23, no country/region tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and the tests completed by different countries/regions differed significantly.
This difference may also seriously affect the reports of cases of death, and in some countries, this ratio may be seriously overestimated.
In real-time reversal polio-enzyme chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, it is possible to obtain reliable results only within the first week after the virus is infected.
In general, the results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test, which is performed with a garlic, can only be done within the first week after the virus is infected.
After that, the virus disappears in the throat, but continues to reproduce in the lungs.
For infected people who are diagnosed in the second week after the infection, the sample can be replaced with deep respiratory extract obtained through the scraper, or can be used with a cough output (scraper).
In January 2020, the rRT-PCR was released at Charité Hospital in Berlin, which was one of the early PCR testing methods and the basis for 250,000 test boxes distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-based SARS-CoV-2 test box (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It searches for all the common "E" genes of β coronavirus, as well as the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp genes. in China, Huawei Gen (BGI Group) is one of the first companies to get the National Pharmaceutical Supervisory Authority approval on the production of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test box for emergency use. in the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostics panels to public health laboratories through the International Test Resources Department.
The earlier version of the test box used three genetic testing methods, one of which resulted in uncertain results due to the defect of the test, while the Atlanta CDC showed a bottle hole testing; which resulted in the average number of samples successfully processed per day less than 100 throughout February 2020.
The two-part testing methods were recognised as reliable until February 28, 2020, when the state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Supervision Authority on the basis of emergency use authorization.The U.S. Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announces that COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR can be carried out across the country from 5 March 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also announces that COVID-19 tests will be available nationally from March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit is announced; samples must be collected and processed according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 detection is developed and produced by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research (VECTOR).
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered at the Russian Federation Health Supervision Authority.On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was to have developed a test box that can detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, a test method for Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA, which could complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, thereby achieving that a device could perform approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Laboratories) for testing using Abbott’s m2000 systems; the FDA had previously issued similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, a 45-minute test method of Chepheid was also licensed by the FDA for emergency use.
The FDA has approved a test method using thermal expansion technologies such as nucleic acid to replace PCR.
Since this method does not require a series of warming cycles, positive results can be obtained in just 5 minutes and negative results can be determined in 13 minutes.
Taiwan is developing a test method using single-clone antibodies (specially combined with the new coronavirus core shell protein (N protein), hoping that it will provide test results within 15 to 20 minutes, just like the fast flu test.
A literary review in March 2020 came to the conclusion that “in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of the chest is small, and the performance of CT [computer breakdown scan] may be clear, even before the symptoms appear.”
The typical characteristics of CT include double lungs multi-layer glass shade, with external non-equivalent and rear coat.
As the disease progresses, it will develop the manifestity under the chest, fragrance pathways and pneumonia.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan (the place of the initial outbreak of the current major epidemic) shows that CT’s sensitivity is much higher than PCR, but CT’s accuracy is lower, and many of its imaging characteristics are overlap with other pneumonia and diseases.
By March 2020, the American Radiation Society recommended "CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a one-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19."
Part of the immune reaction to the infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections approximately 7 days after the symptoms begin to determine the immunity of the monitored population. measurements can be carried out in a central laboratory (CLT) or through an immediate test (PoCT).
High-voltage automatic systems in many clinical laboratories can be measured above, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although the immune reaction can be traced through a sequential sample, it is usually measured using an outsourcing blood sample.
For PoCT, it is generally possible to obtain a blood sample with a skin scratch.
There is no need to take extract steps before measurement, which is different from the PCR method.On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved 29 entity declared testing methods, which are now able to distribute their antibodies test box.
By the end of March 2020, the Omon Medical Experimental Diagnostic Co., Ltd. and the Epitope Diagnostics test box were approved in Europe, which can be tested for viral IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The detection capacity is to detect hundreds of samples within hours, so it is much faster than the traditional PCR measurement on the measurement of the virus RNA.
In general, the antibodies can be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection.Early in April, the UK found no one in the antibodies test box it purchased to be sufficiently useful.
Hong Kong has established a set of mechanisms that suspect patients can stay at home, "the emergency room provides the patient with a sample test tube", the patient throws the splash into the test tube, then sends the test tube back and then receives the results. UK NHS announces that it is testing a home with a program to detect suspicious cases, so that it can eliminate the risk of infection of others when the patient goes to the hospital, and can eliminate the risk of disinfection of the ambulance after the patient uses an ambulance.
In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Doctors said on 2 March that non-hospitalized institutions were able to perform about 12,000 tests per day, which had already been tested 10,700 times last week.
If the examination is required by the doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
The director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany said the total weekly test capacity in Germany was 160,000 copies.
Until March 19th, free-down testing has been provided in several major cities.
By March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only the number of people the results were positive.
A preliminary laboratory survey found that at least 483,295 samples were tested (including the 12th week of 2020) and 33,491 samples (6.9%) SARS-CoV-2 were positive.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for simultaneous testing of 64 patient samples, i.e. aggregate samples, and further testing only when combined samples were found positive.In Wuhan, Huawei Gen (BGI) temporarily established a 2000 square meters emergency testing laboratory called "Fire Eye", which could be used on February 5, 2020 to treat more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was built for 5 days under the supervision of Wanzhou’s founder, and the modeling showed that if the above detection capacity was not achieved, Lake North’s cases would be more than 47%, and the corresponding treatment isolation costs would be doubled.
Following the Wuhan Laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately successively established the fire eye laboratory, currently in China a total of 12 cities have established the laboratory.
By March 4, 2020, laboratory tests will have a total daily volume of 50,000 copies.Origami Assays’s open-source, multi-way design allows COVID19 tests for up to 1122 patient samples by 93 measurements only.These balanced designs can be operated in small laboratories without the need for an automatic fluid transmitter.
By March, the deficiency and deficiency of the drug has become a barrier to large-scale testing in the EU, the UK and the United States.
This led to some initiators to explore a sample preparation program involving heating the sample to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing.The United Arab Emirates on March 31 announced that it has now conducted new coronavirus testing on its more population, testing more than any other country, and is expanding testing levels to allow a large number of people to receive testing.
The way to this detection capacity is, on the one hand, using drive-through detection, and on the other hand, funding Group 42 and Huawei genes (based on their "fire eye" emergency detection laboratory in China) to create high-voltage laboratories to meet the demand for large-scale population detection.
The laboratory, built in 14 days and able to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day, is the world’s first laboratory that operates so large outside China.
China, France, Germany, China, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different testing methods for different parts of the coronavirus gene chart.
The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the method of Germany’s production of the test boxes to send the test boxes to low-income countries without resources to develop their own test boxes.
The German method was announced on January 17, 2020; the program developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be available after January 28, limiting the U.S. testing capacity. China and the U.S. at the beginning of the explosion had problems with the reliability of the test box, both countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient test boxes to meet the demand and the test recommendations submitted by health experts.
On the contrary, experts believe South Korea’s widespread detection has been helpful to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Thanks to the detection capacity established by the South Korean government in the past few years, it’s mainly focused on the private sector’s laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing program as the best way to slow down the development of the COVID-19 epidemic.The widespread spread of the virus led to a huge demand for testing, which led to the U.S. private laboratory accumulation of hundreds of thousands of tests, and the supply of sprayers and chemicals began to become stressful.
In March 2020, China the accuracy of its test box.
In the United States, the test box developed by the CDC has "defects"; then, the government eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that prevent private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test box from the Chinese company Shenzhen Irry Biotech Limited, finding the test results not accurate.
The company explains that the inexact test results may be caused by the incorrect collection of samples or the misuse of the test box.
The Spanish Cabinet said it will recycle the test box back to the wrong result and replace it with another test box provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test box purchased by the Czech Republic from China were wrong.
Atheş Kara from the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that the checkboxes that Turkey purchased from China were "high error rates" and did not "use them."British purchased 3.5 million checkboxes from China and announced that the checkboxes were unused in April 2020.
Testing and isolating people with positive test results and tracking the history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people can positive effects.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Voy (the first COVID-19 death site in Italy) conducted two rounds of tests on a group of approximately 3,400 people, each round was about ten days away.
Approximately half of the people detected positive and non-symptomatic, and all the cases found have been isolated.
It is to eliminate new infections completely by introducing travel restrictions to the community.
By massive tracking of contacts, restricting entrance travel, detection and isolation, the coronavirus infection in Singapore is far slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not taken any extreme restrictions, such as compulsory closure of restaurants and retail stores.
Singapore has canceled many activities, and it began to recommend residents stay at home on March 28, but the school re-learned in time on March 23 after the holidays.
Several other countries/regions, such as Ireland and South Korea, have also controlled the scale of the disease by massive tracking of contacts, restricting entrance travel, detection and isolation, and less radical blockade measures.
A statistical study found that the higher the number of deaths in countries that are detected, the lower the mortality rates in their cases, the reason may be that these countries are better able to detect only groups with mild symptoms or without symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity and limited national laboratory experience in handling COVID-19 send their first five positive and top ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO comparative laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of these 16 comparative laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the following chart, "Test Positive%" is listed under the influence of the country's testing policy.
In the same circumstances, the country where only hospitalized persons were diagnosed with a higher positive detection rate compared to the country where all citizens were diagnosed (whether symptoms appear or not).
Hand washing, also known as hand cleansing, is the act of cleansing the hands for the purification of dust, oil, microorganisms or other useless substances on the hands.
In some “critical moments” of the day, keeping hands washed with soap can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, all of which can be spread through the feces.
If people don’t wash their hands before they get in touch with their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. the mucosa), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common colds.
Five key moments of washing your hands with soap during the day: before cleansing, after cleansing the baby's back or after changing the pill, before feeding, before meals, and before processing food, or after processing meat, fish or poultry.
Without soap and water, your hands can be cleaned with grain ash.The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands in the following cases:
Preparing food before, during and after.
Care of the patient.
Replace the coat or clean the baby's back after the toilet.
Wash the nose, cough or after spraying.
After touching animal, animal food or animal feces.
Hand health of medical staff refers to health habits related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before medication or medical care can prevent or maximize the spread of the disease.
In the medical field, the main objective of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals on the hands that may harm the human body or cause disease.
The washing of hands is especially important for people who are involved in food processing or working in the medical field, but for the public, the washing of hands is also very important.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including maximizing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduce the mortality rate of babies at home.
A 2013 study found that improving handwashing habits had a slightly promoting effect on the height increase in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, promoting simple behavior changes (e.g., washing hands with soap) can reduce children's deaths related to respiratory and diarrhea diseases.
This simple behavior can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by 50%.
This method of supporting the washing of hands can reduce about one-third of the occurrence of diarrhea, which is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
As a spontaneous behavior in families, schools and communities around the world, handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, as a major acute respiratory infection, is the primary cause of death of children under the age of five, with pneumonia taking about 1.8 million lives each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia lead to a total of 3.5 million children’s deaths each year.
According to the United Nations Children’s Foundation, making rooted habits of washing hands with soap before and after a meal, compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, can save more lives, reduce the deaths caused by diarrhea by almost half, and reduce the deaths caused by acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
As part of the water supply, environmental health and personal health (WASH) projects, other sanitary interventions are often taken while advocating handwashing.
Hand washing can also prevent inflammation that spreads through direct physical contact.
Washing hands will have a slight adverse effect, that frequently washing hands will cause the skin to dry and thus cause skin damage.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive washing of hands could cause skin swelling, scratch, known as arthritis or arthritis, which is common among healthcare professionals.
Excessive frequent washing of hands is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsory disease (OCD).
In order to reduce the spread of the disease, five key moments of handwashing with soap during the day: after the toilet, after cleaning the baby's back, before feeding, before meals, and after the processing of food, or after the processing of meat, fish, or poultry.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, the right way to wash hands should also be used in the following cases: after treatment of the cutting or wound before; after spraying, coughing or thinning the nose; after touching the animal’s sputum or after treating the animal; and after touching the waste.
In many countries/regions, the percentage of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households are used to handwashing with soap.A 2014 study found that the highest percentage in Saudi Arabia reached 97%; the U.S. is close to the average, 77%; the lowest percentage in China is 23%.Today, a number of methods have been implemented to defend the behavior of handwashing with soap at critical moments.
The “Basic Healthcare Program” launched by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of taking large-scale initiatives to improve children’s health and education.
The core of this country’s plan is to throw the insects twice a year, supplementing with daily washing hands with soap and with fluoride toothpaste.
In Indonesia, the program has also been successfully launched.
Injection of soap or cleansers in water can better clean up the skin’s microorganisms.
The main role of soap and cleansers is to reduce solubility obstacles and improve solubility.
Only water can not effectively clean the skin, as fat and protein (components of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.
But cleaning of hands requires reasonable water.
Solid soap, because it can be repeatedly used, may retain the bacteria left before use.
A small number of studies examined the case where bacteria were transferred from contaminated solid soap, and the conclusion was that bacteria could not be transferred because bacteria would be washed by the bubble.
But the CDC continues to claim that it is "best to choose non-contact liquid soap."
Antibacterial soap has been promoted strongly among the public with health awareness.
Until now, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended antibacterial or deodorant has selected antibiotic resistant microorganisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial substances such as trichloric soap, and trichloric soap has a large number of resistant microbial spots.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soap is not selected for antibiotic resistant bacteria plants, antibacterial soap may not be so effective as promoted.
In addition to surface active ingredients and skin care ingredients, the complex formula may also contain acids as pH regulators (acid, antibacterial acid, lactic acid), antibacterial active benzoic acid, as well as more skin regulators (aluminium, vitamins, phosphorus, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis conducted by the Oregon University School of Public Health shows that in the prevention of diseases and cleansing of bacteria on the hands, ordinary soap has the same effect as consumer-class antibacterial soap containing trichloric soap.
Hot water washing hands is comfortable, but its heat is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at a body temperature (37 °C).
However, in the purification of natural oil fats that contain soil and bacteria, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing microorganisms on the hands, which is contrary to the general view.
Water-free handwashing or antibacterial handwashing is a non-water-based hand cleanser.
In the late nineteenth and early twenty-first centuries, non-water-based alcoholic hand cleansers (alcoholic handwashers, handwashers and handwashers) were very popular.
Most of the formulas of this type of washing machine contain aneprol or ethanol, then adding capom (acrylic acid polymers) to form gel, or adding hydratants to form liquid, or bubble-shaped to be easy to use, and relieve the drying of the skin caused by alcohol.
Adding hydrogen peroxide after dilution can further increase antibacterial activity. at least 60% to 95% alcohol-containing handwashing can effectively kill bacteria.
Alcohol scratching can kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA) and anti-penicillin intestinal bacteria (VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cell viruses (RSV), nasal viruses, bacteria, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
After 30 seconds of use, 70% of the alcohol content of the handwasher can kill 99.97% of the bacteria on the hand (reduced by 3.5 levels, similar to reduced by 35 degrees), and after 1 minute of the handwasher can reduce the bacteria on the hand by 99.99% to 99.999% (reduced by 4 to 5 levels).
Alcoholic handwashing is almost completely ineffective against viruses such as norovirus (norovirus, also known as Norwalk, Norwalk) (the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal inflammation). it is necessary to use sufficient antibacterial handwashing or alcoholic handwashing to completely wet or cover the hands.
Wash the heart and back of the hands and between the fingers and all the ends of the fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, bubble or gel is dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that it is best to wash your hands rather than to use non-washing hands, especially when your hands look dirty.
Because these handworms are easy to use and can quickly cause microorganisms to lose their activity, they are increasingly used; however, they should not be replaced by proper handworms unless there is no soap and water available for use.
Frequent use of alcohol and handwashing can cause the skin to dry unless the formula adds moisturizer and/or moisturizer.
You can add glyphosate and/or other lubricants to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying of the skin caused by alcohol.
In clinical experiments, alcohol containing lubricants, compared to soap or antibacterial cleansers, can significantly reduce the occurrence of skin irritation and drying.
Allergic exposure to dermatitis, exposure to thyroid syndrome or allergy to additives in alcohol or alcohol is rare.
Alcohol is less likely to trigger exciting contact skin inflammation compared to the use of soap and water washing, which is one of the reasons why it is attractive.
Although water-free cleansers are effective, they cannot remove organic substances on the hand, simply disinfect them.
Therefore, handwashing is less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, as these pathogens remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic handwashers depends largely on the ingredients and formula, which has been much worse than alcoholic and alcoholic handwashers.
Recently, the recipe for using benzodiacloride has been proven to have a continuous, accumulated antibacterial activity after use, this is different from alcohol, alcohol has been proven to have a reduced effect after repeated use, probably because it will gradually cause negative skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to carry the sable and can be replaced with grass or soil.
Grass or soil is better than hand washing with water alone, but less than soap.
One problem that exists is that if soil or grass is contaminated by microorganisms, it may accelerate the spread of the disease rather than slow the spread.
Like soap, grain ash is also a disinfectant, as it forms an alkaline solution after it comes to water.
WHO recommends that if no soap is available, soap can be replaced with grass or sand.
The correct handwashing methods recommended by the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:
Wash your hands with flowing hot or cold water.
The recommended use of flowing water is because the stained basin may be polluted, and the water temperature seems to be little related.
Use sufficient amounts of soap to repeatedly wash to produce a bubble, while cleaning the back of your hands, between your fingers and your nails.
Soap can remove bacteria on the skin, and studies show that people are more likely to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when washing their hands with water alone.
Wash for at least 20 seconds.
Washing can produce friction, which helps to remove bacteria on the skin, the longer the washing time, the more bacteria are removed.
Clean fully with flowing water.
Washing your hands with water can cause reinfection.
Dry with a clean towel or dry naturally.
The moisture of the hands is more easily reinfected.The areas between the fingers, arms, and the fingers are the most frequently neglected areas.
Artificial nails and broken nail oil may hide microorganisms.
It is commonly recommended to use moisturizer to avoid hand dry; dry skin can cause skin damage, thereby increasing the risk of infection spread.
Where developing countries do not have access to water and/or soap, a variety of low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate the washing of hands, for example, through a hanging bar or a hole-shell, and/or using grain grain (when necessary). water supply is limited (e.g., schools or rural areas in developing countries), and water-saving hand washing programs can be used, for example, by simple water-shell and other low-cost ways.
The technique is simple, hanging a water tank with a thread, then throwing a small amount of water into the hand through a footboard, and then using soap.
Efficiently drying hands is an important step in the hand health process, but there are some controversies about the most effective way to dry hands in public toilets.
More and more studies show that paper towels are healthier than the electric dryphones offered in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium (European Tissue Symposium) in the paper towels industry, comparing paper towels, hot-wind dryphones and more modern spray dryphones in terms of hygiene.
After washing your hands, using a hot-wind dry phone to dry your hands, the total number of bacteria on your finger increased by an average of 194%, and the total number of bacteria on your arm increased by an average of 254%.
And with the spray dry phone hand, the total number of bacteria on the finger increased by an average of 42%, the total number of bacteria on the arm increased by an average of 15%.
After washing hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingers is reduced by an average of 76%, the total number of bacteria on the hands is reduced by an average of 77%. scientists have also conducted various tests to determine whether different methods of drying hands may cause cross-infection in other toilet users and toilet facilities.
The spread dry phone is said to spread the air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 miles/h) and can spread microorganisms on the hands and on the body, thereby contaminating other toilet users and toilet facilities within 2 m.
The use of a heated wind dry phone can spread microorganisms to 0.25 meters away from the dry phone.
The results of using paper towel dryers show that there is no severe microbial spread.TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study in 2005 evaluating different methods of drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria occur:
The study involved many different dry-phone manufacturers, comparing these dry-phone with paper towels.
During the trip, without soap and water, you can choose to use the hand deodorant towels to wash your hands.
The alcohol-free alcohol content in the hand washing machine should be at least 60%.
In 1846, the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis found that handwashing could effectively prevent the spread of the disease within the hospital, but only a long time later it was forced to require medical staff to wash hands.
The hospital uses electronic equipment to provide feedback to remind when the hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that the infection rate after using these devices was reduced.
The medical staff should wash hands for at least 15 seconds, and use sufficient amounts of soap and water or gel when washing hands to produce bubbles and throw the various parts of the washing hands.
The fingers are twisted with each other.
If there is a waste between the nails, it can be cleaned with hard hair.
Since the remaining water on the hands may still be bacteria, therefore, it is necessary to fully clean and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, you should use a paper towel to shut the waterhead (if necessary, use a paper towel to open the output door).
This prevents reinfection of the hands due to exposure to these surfaces.
In medical institutions, the purpose of handwashing is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms (“bacteria”) and avoid spread.
A report in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that in most medical environments there are still cases where handwashing is not at an acceptable level, and a large number of health care professionals often forget to wash hands before contacting patients, resulting in the spread of microorganisms.
One study showed that proper handwashing, along with other simple procedures, could reduce the rate of blood flow infection related to the conductive tract by 66%.The World Health Organization published a workshop demonstrating the standard methods of handwashing and handwashing in medical institutions.
The organization also published a draft hand health guidelines on its website to get public opinion.
Whitby and others have made a review.
If it is necessary to verify compliance with the regulations, then commercial equipment can be measured and verified to the health of the hand.
The World Health Organization recommends “five moments of handwashing”:
After contact with blood/body fluid
before the operation and
Adding antibacterial chemicals to the soap ("sabbon" or "antibacterial soap") can make the washing machine an antibacterial effect.
Before surgery or in an environment with a large amount of antibiotic resistant microorganisms, this antibacterial operation may be required.When "wash" the hands for surgery, it must be possible to open and close without contact, hydrogen head, chlorine-induced or silk washing, handwashing after handwashing for dry hands, washing for non-bacterial brushing and other non-bacterial tools for cleaning nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires the cleaning of the hands, the front arm to the wrist, usually washing for 2–6 minutes.
It does not need to be washed for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, it is necessary to prevent the water on the front arm from returning to the hands.
After washing your hands, use an antibacterial cloth to dry your hands and wear a surgical suit.
To reduce the spread of bacteria, it is best to wash your hands before contacting the patient or use an antibacterial handwasher.
In order to control angiobacterial infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing comes from the hand washing rate of 20% and the further benefit is extremely limited when hand washing rate increases to more than 35%.
Compared with the use of antibacterial soap, the use of ordinary soap washing hands will lead to more than three times the percentage of bacterial infectious diseases that spread to food.After comparison with the use of antibacterial soap washing hands with the use of antibacterial soap washing hands (30 seconds respectively), the percentage of antibacterial soap infection is found to be 26% lower than the use of antibacterial soap washing hands.
However, for the reduction of H1N1 influenza A (HI1N1 influenza A) virus and clostridium difficile spores, soap and water are more effective than alcoholic handwashing.The health of the medical facility can be improved by training employees how to wash hands, increasing the supply of alcoholic handwashing and interventions such as written and oral reminders to employees.
Further research is needed on which interventions are the most effective in various medical environments.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered a cost-effective tool for achieving health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools and workplaces makes popular handwashing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there is a cheap way to build a bathroom, it is very rare in every private toilet or public toilet near a safe handwasher.
However, the low frequency of handwashing may also be a rooted habit, not because of the lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating the use of hand washing with soap can affect policy-making, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavior changes in residents.
To be effective, it is necessary to be monitored and evaluated.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that in low-income countries (LMICs) the increased rate of handwashing is community-based methods effective, while social marketing activities are poor. An example of handwashing in schools is the “Samsung method” launched by the United Nations Children’s Foundation, encouraging schools to take simple and cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can rise from one star to the highest three stars.
Handwashing promotions may include building a toilet to reduce diseases and child death rates.
Another example of increased handwashing awareness is the World Handwashing Day, which aims to try to make behavioral changes. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic, the United Nations Children's Foundation promotes using a handwashing expression symbol.
Rare studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost efficiency of handwashing in developing countries and the prevention of disabilities adaptation lifetime year (DALY).
However, reports show that the cost-efficiency of handwashing with soap is significantly greater than other water and sanitary interventions.
The first recognition of the importance of handwashing for human health – especially for those who are weak (e.g., the newly-born mothers or the wounded soldiers in the hospital), was two pioneers in the field of hand health in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, working in Vienna, Austria, and the British “founder of modern nursing” Florence Nightingale.
At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by the bad smell of the so-called anesthesia.
In the 1980s, the outbreaks of food-based diseases and medical-based infections encouraged the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively advocate hand health, emphasizing hand health as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect people from infection with these infectious diseases.
For example, Germany hangs a “right handwashing method” poster next to the public bathrooms, office buildings and airport bathrooms.
The phrase “handwashing does not do” means that someone declares not willing to be responsible for something or not willing to be involved in something.
It comes from the contents of the Bible in the Gospel of Matthew, and Pontius Pilate washed his hands after he decided to baptize Jesus, and later evolved into a widespread use of the language in some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare’s “McBlue”, Mrs. McBlue begins forced washing her hands for attempts to clean the dirty points of imagination, showing her guilt for her crimes and her husband’s crimes.
Studies show that people who remember or imagine an immoral behavior are more likely to wash their hands more often than others, and are more likely to appreciate their hands washing facilities.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after imagining an immoral behavior are less likely to engage in other “cleaning-effective” compensation operations, for example, as volunteers.
Religion requires handwashing for sanitary and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing with water while washing hands but without soap is part of many religious symbolic baptisms, including the Bahá’u’lláh faith, Hinduism, Jewish bathing (tevilah) and baptism (netilat yadayim) purification, Christian baptism and small cleansing in Islam.
Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam requires to wash hands after the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jewishism and Islam requires washing hands before meals.
COVID-19 Workplace Control
COVID-19 workplace prevention means the adoption of risk-controlled occupational safety and health measures to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper risk control at work depends on the specific workplace and work tasks and should be determined on the basis of the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of community diseases and the risk factors that may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposure work is the minimum contact with the work of the public and other colleagues, so it is recommended to take basic infectious prevention measures, including working handwashing, encouraging workers to post-healing home isolation, adhere to breathing rituals, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk work includes the need for frequent or close contact with the work of unknown or suspicious COVID-19 patients who may be infected due to continued community spread or international travel.
Includes access to general public staff, such as schools, a high-density work environment and some large-scale retail environments.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should also use efficient air filters and spray protection devices to ventilate, wear personal protection equipment when exposed to COVID-19 patients and take other hazardous prevention measures.
OSHA believes that the exposure to known or suspicious COVID-19 patients has a high risk of exposure, and that the exposure risks are very high if the staff performs a gas-soluble operation on known or suspicious COVID-19 patients, or collect or process samples from them.
Risk control measures applicable to such persons include engineering controls, such as pressure ventilation rooms and personal protection equipment suitable for their work tasks.
The COVID-19 explosion may have a serious impact on the workplace.
The staff may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of exposure.
Business patterns may also change, including a change in the demand for goods, or a change in the way to get these goods (such as shopping in non-top times, or using delivery or off-road shipping services).
Finally, the logistics of products from COVID-19 epidemic areas may be interrupted. infection prevention and response programs can be used to guide protection actions.
These programs address risks related to various workplaces and work tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from the family and community environment, and risk factors for individual workers, such as elderly or groups with chronic diseases.
These plans also summarize the preventive measures needed to address these risks, as well as the emergency plans for cases that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Infectious Disease Prevention and Response Programs may require state or local recommendations.
The objectives to address the epidemic include reducing the spread between employees, protecting people with a high risk of malhealth complications,ining business operations, and maximizing the negative effects on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response measures will also be affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the enterprise is located.
Risk prevention level is a prevention framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health, and is used to group risks prevention measures according to their effectiveness.
If the damage of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protection equipment.
Engineering control means isolating employees from work-related risks rather than relying on employees’ behavior to control, which is also the lowest cost solution to implement.
Administrative control means changing work policies or procedures that require employees or employers to take action on their own.
Personal protection equipment (PPE) has a lower control effect than engineering control and administrative control, but it helps prevent some exposure.
All types of PPEs must be selected according to the risk levels faced by the staff, equipped according to the applicability (such as a respirator) and must always be properly worn, regularly checked andined, replaced if necessary and properly removed, cleaned, stored or processed in order to avoid pollution.
According to the regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk work is the lowest contact with the public and other colleagues in the profession.
It is recommended that all workplaces take basic infectious prevention measures, including handwashing, advising the sick employees to adhere to the breathing methods when they are isolated from the home, coughing or spotting, providing paper towels and rubbish, preparing for remote office, falling out of work if necessary, encouraging employees to use the tools and equipment of others, and keeping the workplaces daily clean and disinfected.
The timely identification and isolation of potential infectious individuals is the key to protecting workplace staff, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory symptoms be isolated at least 24 hours until there are no fever, fever signs and any other symptoms, the vacation policy should be flexibly implemented, allowing employees to take care of the patient’s families and should clearly inform the employees of the policy.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk work includes the need for frequent or close contact with unknown or suspicious COVID-19 patients within a range of 6 feet (1.8 m), but may cause individuals to become SARS-CoV-2 infected because of the continued spread of the community near the workplace or because they may have recently arrived in the COVID-19 epidemic area.
This type of staff includes working in schools, a high-population working environment and some large-scale retail environment that will be in contact with the general public staff. Engineering control measures aimed at this group and high-risk groups include the installation of efficient air filters, improved ventilation effects, transparent plastic spread protection devices, etc. Installing physical barriers and the installation of free-of-car windows to provide customer service. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging the isolation of the sick staff home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing an unnecessary journey to the COVID-19 explosion site, developing an emergency communications plan, including answering the staff's questions for the forum, providing staff with the latest training and training on the COVID-19 risk factors and behavior protection, using the need for the protection and protection of the protection and protection of the protection of the work
This type of staff is best required to have a breathing machine.
If someone is sick on the plane, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect the staff and other passengers, including arranging the patient to a distance of 6 feet from the other passengers, appointing a crew staff to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask, or asking the patient to cover the mouth with a paper towel when it is coughed or sprayed.
The crew staff should wear one-time medical gloves when treating sick passengers, touching body fluids or potential pollution surface.The crew staff should also wear additional personal protection equipment if sick passengers experience symptoms such as fever, persistent coughing or breathing difficulties.
The gloves and other one-time items should be treated in a bio-dangerous bag and then respond to the polluted surface for cleaning and disinfection. for commercial transport, including tourboats and other passenger vessels, hazard control measures also include delaying travel when ill. If there is a heat or other symptoms on the vessel, it should be self-isolated and immediately inform the medical room on the vessel.
For schools and children’s care sites, the disease prevention control center recommends that the relevant schools and children’s care sites be closed in the short term, regardless of the spread of the community, if the infected person has appeared in the school, to be completely cleaned or disinfected.
For medium-sized communities, social distances can be implemented, such as the cancellation of field visits, meetings and sports classes, singing classes or self-help restaurants, the increase of the distance between office tables, mistake of arrival and departure, the limitation of unnecessary visitors, and the separate health offices for children with flu symptoms.
If the community spreads seriously, it may be considered to extend the interruption time in addition to implementing social distance strategies.For law enforcement personnel performing regular daily activities, the Prevention Control Center believes that they face a lower direct health risk.
It is recommended that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 or suspicious persons of law enforcement should act at the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including equipped with appropriate personal protection equipment.
If a close contact occurs in the process of arrest, the staff must first clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment, then can be reused after using domestic cleansing spray or clay cleansing, and must comply with the standard personal protection equipment cover and treatment procedures, as well as clothing cover and cleansing procedures.
OSHA believes that some healthcare and hospital staff are at high or very high exposure risks.
High exposure risk staff include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff for known or suspected COVID-19 infected persons.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if the staff performs bubble-generation procedures on known or suspicious COVID-19 patients, or collect or treat samples of infected or suspicious infected people.
The bubble-generation processes include injection pipe, cough provokation processes, tuberculosis examinations, some dental procedures and examinations, or body oral samples collection.
High exposure risk staff include staff involved in the handling of the dead's bodies, who were diagnosed or suspicious cases of COVID-19; exposure risks are higher if the body's anatomy is carried out. Additional engineering measures to be taken for this risk group include the isolation rooms prepared for the COVID-19 diagnosed or suspicious cases, including during the execution of the bubble-generation process.
Some healthcare facilities and mortgage rooms can also be equipped with a special pressure ventilation system.
Biosafety Level 3 preventive measures should be taken during the processing of samples.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends different waiting zones for patients depending on whether the patient is suspicious of COVID-19.In addition to other personal protection equipment, the Office of Occupational Safety and Health also recommends that people who work within a 6-foot range of patients with known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as those who perform a bubble-generation process, wear a respiratory device.
The U.S. requires that a comprehensive breath protection program, such as health tests, training, and medical examinations, should use a N95 filter mask or a better mask approved by NIOSH.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide better protection and improve the comfort of the staff.WHO does not recommend using protective clothes because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that does not spread through body fluids.
The WHO recommends that entrance checkers only wear medical surgical masks.
For staff who need to collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without the need to carry out bubble-generating procedures, the WHO recommends that they use medical surgical masks, care glasses or masks, clothes and gloves.
If you want to perform the bubble generation procedure, the medical surgical mask must be replaced with the N95 or FFP2 mask.
Given the lack of global supply of personal protection equipment, the WHO recommends physical barriers, such as remote care, transparent windows, allowing only direct careers to enter the rooms of COVID-19 patients, using personal protection equipment only when specific tasks are truly necessary, continuing to use the same respirator when treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis results, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection equipment, and measures such as not encouraging non-symptomatic people to use masks to reduce the need for personal protection equipment.

We have experienced some difficult situations since this month.
In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we clearly feel the fate of the whole humanity, and at the same time recognize our responsibility to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best way to tackle this challenge requires people around the world to feel compassionate, co-operate and promote community building, which is the core idea of Wikimedia.
The communication of friendship and care between all our colleagues through e-mails, telephones and chats fully proves how different our colleagues are and how we are lucky to work with you.
I am very grateful and proud to be a colleague with you.
Last week, some expressed appreciation for our work.
They make me realize how meaningful it is to use Wikipedia around the world at this moment, and make me realize that this key resource keeps the symbolic power that it brings to people around the world.
Whether your job is responsible for the operation of the website, payments or community security, the proper operation of Wikimedia is unchanged with your hard work.
Today’s world needs more information from Wikipedia than ever.
At this stage, the contents of our work and even the way we work will have a significant impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the importance of our colleagues, we will make some important changes to our way of cooperation starting next week.
Modification of working method and timetable
As Robyn previously mentioned, the executive team met yesterday night to discuss the way and timetables the company works in the next few days to months.
At the meeting, we considered the appropriate response we consider to the current challenges faced by the company, as well as the best practices to ensure that the companyins sustainable development during the epidemic.
The executive team unanimously agreed to reduce the pressure on the company’s employees, allowing everyone to support the company’s mission for a long time.
We support you to adequately reduce work pressure.
For all employees, contractors and contractual workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours a day (or 20 hours a week) and subsequent changes will be notified separately.
This adjustment is not a vacation notice.If you can work longer a day, we will arrange tasks for you according to the length of your work time.
However, as the current world situation is unpredictable, we will prioritize taking care of your personal needs, such as taking care of your family, shopping out or medical consultations.
We will not track your working hours.
If you are sick, leave your job.
This is unclear, but we still want to remind you, please be calm.
You don’t need to apply for a sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team modify the work schedule and timetables to ensure that critical work areas are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 positive, please tell the staff and cultural operations department of Bryan, which will provide you with support and ensure your situation gets the appropriate attention of the management.)
We will pay full wages for timely wages employees.
We have expressed and again committed to complying with the commitments made to contractors and time workers.
The salary we pay to all will continue to be calculated according to the remuneration they obtained by completing normal working hours in normal conditions.
Even if you are sick or unable to work is no exception.
If you are willing to work, we will provide you with support.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through work, releasing their own pressure.
Our work can bring incredible rewards, especially in this time.
But taking care of yourself remains the first.
We ask you to keep in communication with the manager so that we can learn about your latest situation and make the corresponding adjustments.
Priority of important work.
We need to maintain the normal functioning of some important work.
Web site reliability engineering teams, human resources operating teams, trust and security teams and funding teams (and other teams) work are crucial, which may require additional support.
We will begin to evaluate the current project targets with all the departments and move work focus on supporting some of the matters that are crucial to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
The temporarily slowing steps will not affect future development.
We don’t intend to “upgrade overtime” after the epidemic.
We will not ask you for overtime tracking periods, because now it seems unrealistic.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.
What will change in the APP (Annual Plan)?
In order to adapt to the new realities and daily working hours requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for the 2020-2021 year plan.
We want to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 program in exchange for more time spent on budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize critical jobs and take care of themselves and their families, and also to adjust work arrangements for those who need or wish to reduce the amount of work in the coming weeks.
The extension of the timetable can significantly reduce the current planned work volume throughout the organization and reduce the work pressure.
We will submit the above proposals to the Board next week.If the proposal is approved, we will update the following work arrangements to the representatives and teams as soon as possible.
Thank you for the leadership of the APP team in this process.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague at a San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, for careful consideration, we hired some antivirus cleansers to make a complete disinfection of the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-class disinfection solutions to disinfect various surfaces, as well as between the halls and elevators that go to our floor.
The office building is fulfilling its attention obligation agreement, using the corresponding products to ensure the safety of the tenant.
We believe that when you decide to return to work, the office is fully prepared to welcome you.
Our Washington D.C. office adopts the WeWork office, and WeWork shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington D.C. staff.
As of last week, the Washington D.C. Office has changed to a full-fledged office in accordance with the guidelines we have shared with the San Francisco Office.
At the same time, as some New York offices’ colleagues already know, we’ve been discussing the issues related to rent offices in the Brooklyn District.
These discussions continue, but may be delayed.
Some of the colleagues first contacted the remote office.
Other colleagues in the long-term office want to give these colleagues some adjustment advice on the way they work:
Meeting time should be controlled within one to two hours.
If it takes a longer time, consider distributing the content of the meeting to several dates in the meeting.
Defining clearly the objectives of the meeting, drawing up the agenda of the meeting, and sending reading materials in advance.
Use video meetings as a default meeting mode while using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to collaborate and communicate online.
In each meeting, organize a chairman to host a meeting, organize a person responsible for monitoring questions in the chat window and track the changes in the speaker list, and organize another person responsible (or using a multi-person collaboration method) to help make a meeting record.
If you need a comfortable headset, please send an email to contact the technical support department.
Use your health subsidy to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The Human Resource Operating Team is studying Human Engineering Guidelines in the form of a network seminar to help the Foundation’s all colleagues improve their work efficiency during the distributed office.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public activities financed by Wikimedia, including editors, before the WHO announced the end of the epidemic.
These requests for cancellation of activities and other restrictions may cause these community recipients to fail to complete their original donation activities, and we have told them that we understand this and also promise that no one of them will be punished for delaying or changing these goals.
During the next week, we will continue to provide more guidance on Wikimedia and other regional community meetings and thematic community meetings.
The global community seems to be covered with the sadness of the epidemic, but it also reflects compassion for being able to clearly keep attention to their respective communities, Wikimedia and other aspects.
In the future, the CRT team will build a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the influence and track the community’s communication with us.
Keep in touch, communicate with COVID-19 related issues
We are scheduled to hold a special staff meeting on Thursday 14:00 (World Coordination Time) 07:00 (Pacific Time) and we will send the relevant invitations to your calendar later.
At the meeting, we will share some of the latest situations, answer your questions and leave some time for discussions.
We are united and are committed to helping you.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT team will update these pages in time and concentrate all the information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries/regions that are currently seriously affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions regarding travel, activities, major work processes or insurance, or need help in other aspects, please contact and collaborate with the CRT team at any time.
We are committed to providing you with the support and contact you need.
If you have any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an email to the Global Human Resource Operations Director Bryan Judan.
Although we face these changes, we cannot give up our work and our obligations.
Instead, this epidemic makes us realize that we may now need to make adjustments to our work and obligations in a way that has not been before.
We believe that these measures are necessary to help us support each other to continue to work, to provide the necessary support for our actions, and to continue to bring the services they depend on to the world.
Make a plan and do not be afraid of challenges.
Now, please support each other and create space for important work in the next few weeks or even months.
We need everyone to contribute to this goal, so please take care of yourself and your family so that you can stay in the best condition when needed.
Finally, please keep in mind to wash your hands and not touch your face.
Katherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) lead the team’s other members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the cell outer surface (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 suppresses the activity of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the content of vascular stress II and increasing the content of Ang(1-7) and is expected to be a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The source version of this enzyme is usually called hACE2.
The vascular stress converter enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of the intramuscular cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-End Protein M2 structure area and a C-End Collectrin renal amino acid transmission protein structure area.
ACE2 is a single-type I membrane protein, its enzyme active structure area exposed to the cell surface of the lungs and other tissues.
Another enzyme known as sheddase (sheddase) disperses the outcellular structure of ACE2 from the transmembrane structure, releasing the produced soluble protein into the blood and eventually emitting it into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane, mainly the pneumonia type II cells of the lungs, the adrenal cells of the small intestines, the arteric and endocrine cells of the most organs, and the arteric smooth muscle cells.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cortex of the brain, the tissue body, the lower cortex and the mouth dry.
The main function of ACE2 is to balance the ACE.
ACE divides vascular tension I into vascular tension II that is active in vascular contraction.
ACE2 subsequently dissolves the end-mineral amino acid of Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrates it into a vascular tension (1-7), which is active in vascular expansion (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down many other spheres, including de-spheric acid 9, apelin, neurodegenerate, A-sphericide, and stomach hunger.
ACE2 can also regulate the transmission of the membrane of the neutral amino acid transfer protein SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup disease.
As a translaminal protein, ACE2 is the main entrance point for certain coronavirus entering cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (a resulting SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (a resulting COVID-19 virus).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2’s S1 patch proteins combine with the enzyme structure area of ACE2 on the cell surface, leading to an intramuscular effect, allowing viruses and enzymes to be transmitted together into the nucleus inside the cell.
This entrance process also requires the host silicone protein enzyme TMPRSS2 to trigger the activation of S protein, which is currently studying whether the process can be suppressed as a potential therapy.Some people guess that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators recommend continuing to use standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A system assessment and ultrasound analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors significantly reduces the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group.”
In addition, "for patients with a higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, treatment with ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia.
Using ACE inhibitors is also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, but the result is less reliable than reducing the overall pneumonia risk.
Reorganization ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered to be a new method for treating acute lungs damage, which appears to improve the acute respiratory disorders syndrome caused by liposucre and the pulmonary blood flow dynamic indicators and blood oxygen saturation.
RhACE2 in the human body has a half-life of approximately 10 hours, the start time is 30 minutes and the action process (duration) is 24 hours.
Some studies show that for patients with unbearable levels of renin-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitors or high levels of circulatory vascular stress II,rhACE2 may be a promising drug.rhACE2 injections have been evaluated in clinical trials for the therapeutic effect of acute respiratory disorder.
The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile software designed to address the 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic, helping to track the close contact and identify individuals who may have been exposed to the infection ("contacters").
Some regions and jurisdictions have developed or presented many applications with the support of the official government.
Many frameworks for building close contact tracking applications have been created.
Privacy issues have also attracted many sides, especially some systems need to track the geographical location of the application users.
Low-invasive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the distance between users and other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate this feature that supports Bluetooth apps directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has jointly developed an app that supports citizens to check whether they have been exposed to COVID-19 patients.
The program is currently being used in more than 200 cities in China, while Singapore has launched an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source software and will be transferred to the government.North Macedonia launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!", to track exposure to potential infected people and help medical institutions make a quick response.
The application is developed by the Northern Macedonian Department of Communications Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, the app is waiting for approval for Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the close contact tracking application has entered the advanced development phase and will be put into use in the coming weeks. Ireland and France also plan to launch similar application ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering to develop a similar application based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia plans to launch a geographical barrier app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients don’t leave the home.
Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, Ross Anderson, listed some practical problems that app systems may exist, including false positive errors, and it may be ineffective if only a small portion of the population uses the app.
In order to prevent the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple has set restrictions on the types of organizations that can publish coronavirus-related applications in the Apple App Store, which is limited to “official” or other reputational organizations.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy Defenders expressed concerns about the use of coronavirus applications to be monitored on a large scale, especially after the epidemic threat was eliminated, whether the monitoring infrastructure built to respond to the coronavirus epidemic should be dismantled.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations call on restrictions on this surveillance.
These organizations have announced eight conditions that government projects need to meet:
The supervision must be “legal, necessary and consistent”;
Monitoring and monitoring expansion must be provided with the “sunset” conditions;
The data collected is only for COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there is evidence that they are effectively protected.
Digital monitoring must avoid increased discrimination and marginalization.
Any data sharing with third parties shall be defined according to the law;
must provide security measures to prevent data abuse and the right of citizens to respond to data abuse;
Require all "related stakeholders" to "effectively participate", including requiring public health experts and marginalized groups to participate.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter Without Borders (RSF) also published the checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan is aimed at solving the problem of continuous monitoring, which is to be removed from the device operating system once there is no longer a need for tracking.
Some countries are using web-based locations tracking rather than apps, and users do not need to download apps, while also avoid tracking.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to original location data may have serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems with their own central servers need access to personal location data; many of the privacy protection systems that only use the central servers to communicate with each other are now created (see detail below).
South Korea has launched a non-app-based system to perform contact tracking tasks.
The system does not use a specialized application, but chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile devices tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine this information and send notifications to potential infected people through text messages.
In addition to the use of this information to remind potential close contacts, the government has also been allowed to disclose location information as the country has made significant changes to the information privacy law after the MERS epidemic.
The public can access this information through many apps and websites.There are also some countries (including Germany) considering the simultaneous use of centralized systems and privacy protection systems.
Until April 6, 2020, specific details have not yet been announced.
Privacy Privacy Tracking is a recognized concept with a large number of related research literature at least back to 2013. by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts were researching privacy protection solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) to record the distance between users and other phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordination program that contains a centralized and distributed approach, not a single protocol. distributed protocols include distributed privacy protection neighbor tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, originally called contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) etc.
Under these protocols, identifiable personal data will never leave the device, and all matchings are done on the device.
The privacy team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or route cross data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the White Paper Research and Development of Applications Unreliability: Protecting Personal Privacy in Epidemic, published in March 2020.In addition, Enigma MPC, a company originally also founded in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory and dedicated to the development of privacy technology, also develops a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses security hardware technology to support users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without damaging data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, a number of groups jointly established a global TCN alliance around the same approach and the same protocol, aimed at reducing fragmented information and supporting the global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, which is a key to widespread applications.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that its official government application used the open source BlueTrace agreement.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a close contact tracking plan claiming that the plan combines Bluetooth’s low-energy technology with privacy-protected encryption technology to play a role in protecting privacy.
In addition, they also publish the core technical standards used in the system.
Apple and Google said the system was planned to be launched in three stages:
Launch some tools to support the government to create a confidential official coronavirus tracking application
Integrating this feature directly into iOS and Android systems, Google and Apple plan to launch the system first through operating system updates, and after the epidemic threat will also remove the system in the same way to solve the subsequent monitoring problem.
Re-location (also known as re-use, re-evaluation, re-distribution or therapeutic conversion of a drug) refers to the replacement of an approved drug for other purposes for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from the initial purpose of its research and development.
This is a scientific pathway that is currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and recovery period plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 types of protein that can be used for medication, each of which has multiple component binding points.
The analysis of these combination points provides a reasonable solution for the development of effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 protein.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include pepper protein enzymes, RNA-dependent RNA polymenzymes, deflation enzymes, S protein and ADP nucleus diphosphate enzymes.

Scientific community has criticized drugs that are used to reuse resources developed specifically for HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
The World Health Organization (WHO) incorporates Lotynave/Litonave into the international unity test.
Redsive is a medicine created and developed by Gilled Science Company for the treatment of Ebola and Marburger virus infections.Gilled Science Company later found that Redsive has an antiviral activity outside the body against a variety of silicon viruses, pneumonia viruses, adhesive viruses and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral therapy is that the resistance produced through mutations can lead to more severe diseases and spread.
Some early pre-test studies showed that Redsive may have a higher drug resistance genetic barrier.A number of clinical trials are currently underway, two of which are carried out by the University Hospital of Cleveland; one is targeted to mid-symptomatic patients and the other is targeted to more severe symptoms.
There are currently three clinical trials on COVID-19 patients hospitalized with severe injections; two commodity control trials (China, Canada) and one non-control trials (Italy).

The b'A COVID-19 vaccine refers to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) prescription vaccine.
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, many attempts to develop this vaccine are still ongoing.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it is expected that no vaccine for this viral virus SARS-CoV-2 will appear within 18 months.
In April, five candidate vaccines entered the Safety Study Phase I.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
In 2020, a large-scale epidemic spread around the world, causing huge investments and research activities in the development of vaccines.
Many organizations are using the published viral genome to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
The CEPI presented a vaccine development plan in April, saying it is urgent for speed, productivity, large-scale displays and global availability.
In April, CEPI scientists that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technological platforms are researching and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.
The main platform targets for entry into the Security Research Phase I include:
Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) (Fase I Developer and Candidate Vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Virus carriers (developers and candidates for phase I vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 virus carriers)
Scientists from the CEPI in April that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in early development stages, 78 of which have been confirmed as being underway projects (according to the Milken Institute’s data, 79), and 37 have been announced, but almost no public information (presumed being planned or planned).
The I-II phase tests conduct preliminary safety and immunity tests, usually multi-point tests for random, commodity control, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants, including the control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in the prevention of diseases while monitoring the optimal dose of negative reactions.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (confirmed until the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in human body (there are still in a “pre-clinical” study).
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it is studying the potential of a molecular prophetic vaccine that can genetically modify the viral protein to stimulate the immune reaction.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities will concentrate resources and combine cloud computing resources from HP, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM’s supercomputers.
Some vaccines have an external effect, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that in addition to the prevention of diseases, they can bring other benefits.
Further random trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 healthcare workers.
The vaccine developed may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies using COVID-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2 genetically transmitted mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates, to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine showed the need for the treatment of living viruses to take levels 3 of bio-security restrictions and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have already been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there will be no safe and effective SARS treatment or preventive vaccine for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new types of vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is an urgent task for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS was popular, it was believed that existing SARS studies could provide useful patterns for the development of vaccines and therapies for MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I clinical trials and three other vaccines are under development, all of which are viral carrier vaccines, two are adenoid carrier vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), one is MVA-MERS-S.
Various social media articles promoted a conspiracy theory, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and the vaccine is already available.
The patents quoted in various social media articles refer to the existing coronavirus (such as SARS coronavirus) genetic sequence and vaccine patents.
2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing and breathing.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle acid pain, diarrhea, throat pain, smell loss and stomach pain.
The incubation period varies from the patient's contact to the disease's occurrence of 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some cases develop into viral pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction.
By April 17, 2020, the total number of cases in 210 countries and regions worldwide exceeded 224 million and the number of deaths exceeded 153,000.
More than 568,000 people are recovered by treatment.The virus spreads mainly through close-range contact between people, and is often spread by the bubble produced by coughing, spotting or speaking.
Though breathing produces bubble, bubble usually falls to the ground or the surface of various objects and does not cause distant infection.
Furthermore, if someone touched the virus-infected surface and then touched the mouth of the eye, the virus may also be infected.
The virus can survive on the surface for a maximum of 72 hours.
Although early and late recovery periods may spread, they are most infectious three days before the occurrence.The standard diagnosis method is to perform a real-time reversal polio-enzyme chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test.
It is recommended that suspects with the virus and their careers wear a mask.
Recommendations for the public to wear masks are different, some authorities oppose to wear masks, while others demand to wear masks.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine or an effective anti-virus treatment.
The vast majority of countries in all six WHO regions have local spread of the disease.
Viral infected persons may have no symptoms and may have suspicious influenza symptoms, such as fever, coughing, weakness and breathing.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or swelling, awareness confusion, difficulty awakening and face or lips bleeding; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to immediately consult a doctor.
A few cases may be accompanied by symptoms of the upper respiratory tract, such as swelling, swelling or throat pain.
Also monitored different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Some cases in China only show symptoms of swelling and heartbeat in the early days.
Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and even cause death.
We call this a period of crossing.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected people experience symptoms within 11.5 days after infection. the report notes that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of non-symptomatic infectants in the spread of the epidemic is not completely clear; however, preliminary evidence suggests that non-symptomatic infectants may promote the spread of the disease.
According to the South Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), 20% of the diagnosed cases did not show any symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China has included non-symptomatic cases in its daily reports since April 1, with 130 (78%) of the 166 infected cases on that day without symptoms when they were tested.
Both spine and spine can carry a lot of viruses.
Speaking loudly throws more foam than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that non-covered cough could lead to bubble spread at a maximum distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although these viruses generally do not spread through the air, the National Academy of Sciences estimates that they may spread through biogas solvents, and the air collectors on the outer corridor of the hospital detect a positive sample of the virus’s RNA.
Medical procedures such as tubular and cardiovascular recovery (CPRs) may blur the respiratory secretions, resulting in the transmission of air.
There are some concerns that the virus may spread through the feces, but this risk is considered lower.When the patient develops symptoms, the virus is most infectious; although it may spread before the symptoms occur, the risk is lower.
The European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) said that although the transmission of the new coronavirus is not completely clear, one person in general can infect 2-3 people.
Specifically, known new coronavirus can survive a day on the paper plate, survive up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and survive up to four hours on 99% pure copper products.
However, its survival time is also influenced by moisture and temperature.
If used correctly, soap and cleansers can also have the effect of killing the virus. soap products can destroy the virus’s fat protective layer, making it lose its activity, while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzochloride and chlorogenic glucose acid (a surgical disinfectant) are poorly effective.A study in China in Hong Kong shows that the average sampling of saliva is due to two days after hospitalization.
The viral load of the first sample of 5/6 patients is the highest, and the viral load of 1/6 patients is the highest detected the next day.
Serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first separated from three patients with pneumonia in Wuhan's group of acute respiratory diseases.
All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus in nature.
Before the virus has entered the human body, it can be destroyed by home-based soap, as the soap can destroy the virus's protective membrane.SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most severe organs affected by COVID-19, as the virus enters the host cells through vascular stress enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the latter has the highest content in the type II lungs bubble cells.
The virus connects with ACE2 and enters the host cells through a special surface sugar protein called "touch" (cocktails).
Of the patients treated at the hospital in Wuhan, China, 12% of infected people found acute heart and muscle injury, with a higher percentage of severe diseases.
The disease worsening process causes inflammatory reactions throughout the body and disorders in the immune system, with a high rate of cardiovascular symptoms, but acute cardiovascular damage may also be associated with the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in regulating the heart function.
It is that COVID-19 infected people with COVID-19 infection (31%) and vascular blood clots (25%) have a high rate of occurrence and may be associated with poor forecast.COVID-19 deadly patients were diagnosed with mythical pulmonary damage (DAD) and lymphic cell inflammatory infusion in the lungs.
Though SARS-COV-2 is predisposed to expression of ACE2, COVID-19 patients experience an over-inflammatory reaction throughout the body.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells in the body of COVID-19 patients are associated with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6 secretion single-core cells and severe lung pathologies.
The autopsy reports also saw lymphatic cells immersed.
The WHO has published several disease testing programs.
The standard detection method is the use of real-time reversed polymer enzyme chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually tested for the breathing path sample obtained through a nasal clay; however, it can also be used with a nasal clay or a clay sample.
In general, the results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can also be done, but it takes a two-week interval for two blood samples to be collected, with almost no immediate results.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate coronavirus bacteria and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop a polio-enzyme chain reaction (PCR) testing material to detect whether the virus is infected.
By April 4, 2020, antibodies (not only to detect active infections, but also to detect whether individuals have been infected with the virus in the past) are still under development, but have not been promoted to use.
According to Chinese experience, the accuracy of the test was only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. FDA approved the first immediate diagnosis drug and was introduced to use at the end of that month.The diagnosis guidelines published by the Wuhan University Central South Hospital proposed methods for diagnosing infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemic risk.
Early infection is widely seen double lungs multi-layer glass shade, with external non-equivalent and rear coat.
As the virus develops, it may occur under the chest, fragrance pathways (smalled leaves and thickness accompanied by different degrees of pulmonary bulbs) and lung mutations.
There is very little information about COVID-19 micropathological injury and pathological physiology.
The main pathologies of the autopsy were found as follows:
Eye examination: endometriosis, heart disease, pneumonia and pneumonia
There are four severe levels of viral pneumonia:
Light pneumonia: pneumonia, pneumocellular growth, a large number of non-typical pneumocells, interstitial inflammation accompanied by lymphatic cells and the formation of multi-core giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: Mythical pneumonia damage (DAD) accompanied by mythical pneumonia penetration.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and severe low oxygen.
Rehabilitation period pneumonia: fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid
Blood: dispersive intravenous coagulation (DIC); child-white-red cell reaction
To reduce the risk of infection, precautions can be taken include: staying at home; avoiding entering crowded areas; frequently washing hands with soap and water and lasting for at least 20 seconds;ining good respiratory hygiene; avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering the mouth with a paper towel when it is coughing or sprinkling; if there is no paper towel, it is recommended to use the inner side of the wrist.
It is recommended to properly clean your hands after coughing or spraying.
The CDC recommends wearing clothes in public places to some extent prevent non-symptomatic patients from spreading the virus. The core of social distance strategies is closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and abolishing large public meetings, thereby reducing the chances of infected people to get in touch with large groups.
In addition, the social distance standard provides forining a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 m) in interpersonal interactions.
Since the vaccine is expected to be developed at least by 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, the known "Laping Epidemiological Curve".
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there is clear pollution after the toilet or on the hands, before meals, and after swelling, coughing or spraying.
Additionally, it is also recommended to use at least 60% alcohol-containing handwashers, but only when there is no soap and water.WHO offers two formulas to be produced on the ground for areas where it is unable to buy water-free handwashers.
These formulas stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or acethanol.
The use of hydrogen peroxide helps to eliminate bacterial bacteria in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a “hand deodorant active substance.”
Add glucose as a moisturizer.
Providing supportive care to people, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and other important affected organ support.
CDC recommends suspicious viral carriers to wear simple masks.
It has already been used inorganic membrane oxygen (ECMO) to alleviate the symptoms of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain personal health and to promote a healthy lifestyle and eating habits, thereby improving immunity.
Supporting sexual therapy may be effective for early infection patients.The WHO and the National Health Committee of China have launched an initiative calling for proper care for COVID-19 patients hospitalized.
U.S. clinical experts and pneumonia experts have compiled the treatment recommendations presented by the institutions into a list and provided through the IBCC for free.
Until April 2020, COVID-19 special effects therapy has not yet been developed.
For certain symptoms, some medical specialists recommend the use of pulmonary breathing pain (the acetaminofen) in place of bluffine for first-line treatment.
Preventive measures must be taken, to maximize the risk of viral transmission, and in a medical environment to complete operations that may produce gas solvents, such as pipe or hand ventilation, to pay particular attention to protection.
For the healthcare staff in care for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that patients be transferred to the air-transmitted infectious disease isolation room (AIIR) in addition to taking standard preventive measures, exposure preventive measures and air-transmission preventive measures.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothes, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. if possible, it is best to use a respirator (not a mask).
The N95 mask is allowed to be used in industrial locations, but the FDA has authorized the use of this mask under the Emergency Use License (EUA).
It is mainly used to prevent the inhalation of suspended particles (such as dust), but it cannot guarantee the effective isolation of specific biological preparations when used for other purposes.
Without a mask, the CDC recommends using a mask and can also wear a self-made mask if necessary.
Most cases of COVID-19 symptoms are mild, without the use of mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but certain proportions of cases require such measures.
Medical staff are actively conducting research in order to provide breathing support to COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure symptoms. There is evidence that high-flow oxygen therapy or double-dimensional respiratory tract pressure can prevent adhesives.
It is not yet clear whether the two of the above treatments can have the same effect for severe patients.
If the conditions allow, some doctors tend to use mechanical ventilation, because compared to high-flow oxygen therapy, this technology can also limit the spread of gas soluble particles. severe cases are mainly in the elderly (over 60 years old, especially in the elderly over 80 years old).
The number of beds per capita in many developed countries is insufficient, and the medical system is unable to cope with the severe situation that requires hospitalization due to the increased number of COVID-19 cases.
A study in China found that 5 percent of patients had to be sent to severe hospitals, 2.3 percent needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4 percent had to die.
About 30% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in China are eventually sent to the ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the mechanical ventilation complexity increases further and the oxygen difficulty increases.
At this time, it is necessary to use a supported pressure control mode and a high PEEP breathing machine to maximize the transfer of oxygen, while trying to reduce the risk of the breathing machine causing lungs damage and breasts.
An old breathing machine may not be able to a high PEEP.
Starting the study of potential therapies in January 2020, several antiviral drugs have already entered the clinical trial phase.
Redsiwe seems to be the most potential drug at the moment.
Although new drugs may only be developed by 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other purposes or have entered the advanced test phase.
Patients with severe illness can try to use antiviral drugs.
The WHO calls for a wide range of volunteers to take part in potential therapeutic effectiveness and safety tests.The FDA has temporarily authorized recovery period plasma transfusion as a experimental treatment for treating severe patients with life-threatening diseases.
No necessary clinical research has yet been carried out to prove whether the therapy can safely and effectively treat the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to prevent the epidemic.
Users must enter their name and ID number as requested.
The app is able to detect “tink contact” by monitoring data and then assess the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
Once the potential risks are detected, the app will not only recommend self-isolation, but also send warnings to local health officials. integrated use of mobile data big data analysis, face-identification technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence to track the infected and their contact people in South Korea, China, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government approved security agencies to track mobile data of suspicious coronavirus carriers.
The aim of this measure is to force isolation and protect groups that may be exposed to infected citizens.
Likewise, in March 2020, German Telecom and the German Federal Government Institute Robert Koch shared the aggregated mobile location data in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed face identification technology to detect people who violate the rules of isolation.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera noted that mobile phone operators’ data showed that “40% of citizens are still walking around.”
The German government hosted a 48-hour weekend hacking marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid calls for creative solutions globally to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Separation, travel restrictions, therapeutic side effects or anxiety of self-infection, all of which can be disturbing.
According to Rory O’Connor, “social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic disasters are the perfect storm that damages people’s mental health and well-being.”
This disease is more modest, and the symptoms are rarely even without any symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Light cases can usually recover within two weeks, while severe or severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Other similar viruses (such as SARS and MERS) show that pregnant women are at a high risk of developing to severe COVID-19 patients, but lack of COVID-19 data support.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS), resulting in respiratory failure, degenerative shock or multiorgan failure.
COVID-19-related complications include dementia, abnormal blood clot, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have an abnormal coagulation, especially a prolonged time of coagulation, while 4% of patients have an abnormal kidney function.
About 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have an increase in hepatase (transaminase).
According to the same report, the average time from disease to death is ten days, with the average time of hospitalization five days.
However, the average time of hospitalization to death of patients transferred to the ICU is seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Committee of China (NHC) found that the male mortality rate was 2.8 and the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
The pathological examination of the body's pneumonia sample tissue shows that both lungs occur mythical pneumonia damage accompanied by cellular fiber mucous sample secretions.
Lung cells observe viral cell disease.
The lungs image is similar to the acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths by the National Health Committee of China, 11.8% were caused by heart damage due to a rise in muscular calcium protein levels or heart failure.
According to data published in March in the United States, 89 percent of hospitalized patients have a history of disease and the supply of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region may also affect the mortality rate.
Due to regional differences and methodological difficulties, the estimated death rate of the disease results vary.
Underestimated illness cases may lead to overestimated mortality rates.
However, if the case death is caused by a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop to severe COVID-19 patients and about 2.4 times more likely to suffer from severe care or death.
China's Hong Kong Hospital Administration found that some rehabilitators' lung activity decreased by 20% to 30%, and lung scans showed organs damaged.
In addition, after recovery you may face severe post-care symptoms.
By March 2020, it is unclear whether a previous infection will allow recoverers to have an effective long-term immunity.
According to the behavioral characteristics of other coronavirus, immunity may be determined, but some COVID-19 cases have been to be positive shortly after recovery.
It is believed that these cases are a continuous deterioration of infection rather than reinfection.
This virus is considered a natural virus, originating in animals, through the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, almost all of the infection was interpersonal.
The first 41 cases of COVID-19 case studies, published in January 2020 by Liu Liu, showed that the first date of occurrence was 1 December 2019.
The first date of occurrence by the WHO official publication was December 8, 2019.
There are usually several methods to measure mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region, and change from time to time, and are influenced by population characteristics such as testing, quality of health systems, treatment schemes, the time of the first epidemic outbreak and age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07.1 to laboratory-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection death cases and assigned the U07.2 to clinical or epidemiological diagnosed COVID-19 infection but not laboratory-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 death cases.
According to statistics from John Hopkins University, by April 17, 2020, the global disease death rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measurement criteria include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), the first reflect the percentage of the diagnosed deaths, the latter reflect the percentage of the diagnosed deaths (including the diagnosed and undiagnosed deaths).
These statistics have no time limit and track the entire process of solving a specific population from infection to case.
Although not all people infected produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of infections.
Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with only 4,600 inhabitants and 80 people (1.7%) have died from the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through a variety of festivals and even affects young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
In addition, the German healthcare system is unhealthy.
A blood donor assessment shows that about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
Until now, it has confirmed that 69 people (0.004 percent of the total population) have died from COVID-19.
The effects of the epidemic and death rates vary according to gender.
Chinese and Italian studies show that the death rate in men is higher than in women.
Men aged 50-60 are at the highest risk of death, with only the gender gap close to the age of 90.
The male death rate in China is 2.8%, and the female death rate is 1.7%.
The exact cause of this gender difference is still unclear, but may be caused by genetic and behavioral factors.
Based on gender immunological differences, women have a lower rate of smoking and men have a lower age of complications (such as high blood pressure) than women, resulting in a higher rate of male death than women.
In Europe, 57% of men are infected, as the total number of deaths from COVID-19 is more than 72% of men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government has not yet tracked gender-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Studies show that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS have different effects on men and women.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher and the risk of exposure to the virus is also higher.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease was officially named "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained this: CO represents the “corona”, VI represents the “virus”, D represents the “sickness” and 19 represents the time of the epidemic’s first outbreak (December 31, 2019).
The reason to choose this name is to avoid citing specific geographical locations (e.g., China), species of animals or populations in order to comply with the international name recommendations to prevent pollution. causing COVID-19 virus is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO also used the “COVID-19 virus” and the “COVID-19 provoking virus” in public spread.
Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as “coronavirus”.
During the first Wuhan epidemic in China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases be used as temporary viral and disease names, according to the 2015 guidelines on the use of locations in diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 will be released on February 11, 2020.
Given the standard supply chain’s capacity limits, some digital manufacturers have started printing health care materials, such as nose washers and respiratory components.
For example, an Italian hospital has an urgent need for ventilation valves, suppliers can’t deliver parts within the required time, a local startup carries out reverse engineering, printing the 100 ventilation valves needed during the night.
After the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were rapidly spread through the network.
People seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
Research has not found evidence of viral replication in pigs, cows and chickens.
No medications or vaccines for the treatment of this disease are yet approved.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers are actively conducting international research and developing vaccines and drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "solidity test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that are most likely to produce therapeutic effects.
There are no vaccines yet, but institutions are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through ACE2 receptors, it is necessary to take advantage of SARS-CoV's previous work results.
People are studying three vaccine strategies.
First, the researchers are planning to develop an entire viral vaccine.
The use of these viruses, whether it is an inactive virus or a death virus, aims to trigger a rapid immune reaction in the human body when new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy is to develop a sub-unity vaccine, aimed at developing a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to make sensitive reactions to certain sub-unities of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 cases, such studies focused on the specialization of S-touching proteins that assist the viral infiltration into the ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is to develop a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a new type of vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the test vaccines developed by these strategies must be tested.On 16 March 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched their first clinical test.
The vaccine contains a series of harmless genes derived from the viral replication that causes the disease. People have always thought the antibodies addiction enhancing effect could be a major challenge faced during the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this claim is controversial.
By April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials were conducted.
Seven tests completed the evaluation and were authorized to be used in the treatment of malaria, including four studies on thyrocloride or chloride.
Conversion of antiviral drugs for use accounts for the vast majority of China’s research, and nine phase III clinical trials on Redsive will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.
By April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the candidate medicine has begun.The existing antiviral medications for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently being evaluated, including Redsive, Chlorine and Chlorine, Lopinawe/Litonawe and Lopinawe/Litonawe combination interferon β.
By March 2020, the therapeutic effectiveness of Redsive has been initially confirmed.
Observations have found that clinical symptoms in patients treated with sympathic remedies have been relieved.
The U.S., China and Italy are currently conducting Phase III clinical trials.February 2020, China launched the chlorine (formerly used to treat malaria) study and achieved initial results.
However, there was a call for a fellow review of the study.
South Korea and China’s health authorities recommend chlorine use.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1g a day, while reminding that the double dose is very dangerous and may even be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use license for chloride and chloride, but doctors have the right to decide whether to use the two of the above medications to treat COVID-19 patients.
Initial data show that high doses of libavelin have an inhibitor to SARS-CoV-2 outside the body.
After confirming the low-concentrat inhibitor effect of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to conduct further in-body studies with nitrogen. Studies show that the primary thyroid protein caused by the trans-film protein enzyme sionic acid 2 (TMPRSS2) is a necessary condition for the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 receptors into the human body.
Whether used in conjunction with Achipelin or not, the studies of chloride and thyrochloride have severe limitations, and the medical community cannot accept these treatments unless further research is carried out. Ostave has no inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 outside the body and has not yet been found to have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
Cell-factor storms may become a complication of post-treatment with severe COVID-19 patients.
There is evidence that thyrocloride may have anti-cellular factor storm properties.After completion of a small study, the National Health Committee of China will include the thyrocloride antibodies in the treatment guidelines.
After the results of the test were positive, Italy is conducting a national-level 2 non-rasual test.
Combined with the blood test of serum iron protein, the identification of cell factor storms, aimed at preventing the development of the disease, while cell factor storms are believed to lead to the death of some infected people.
In 2017, with the support of a review case study, the FDA approved the use of White Cell Medium 6 receptor fluoride antibodies for treatment of other causes caused by the Steroid Difficult Cell Release Syndrome, the CAR T Cell Therapy.
Until now, there is no random checking evidence to prove that Toughened Laminated Safety can be effectively treated with CRS.
Currently it is being studied to extract COVID-19 rehabilitators' immune system produced purified accrued antibodies, which are injected to those in need of antibodies, as a passive immune therapy before the successful development of the vaccine.
This strategy has been tried during the SARS epidemic, but the effectiveness is uncertain.
The virus and is a expected mechanism of action by passive antibodies therapy intermitting SARS-CoV-2 immune defense.
However, some other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cell toxicity and/or absorption, can the same effect.
Currently, other forms of passive antibodies are being developed, such as the use of artificial cloning antibodies.
The amount of serum production in the rehabilitation period may increase, which is beneficial for rapid dissemination. the serum consists of a liquid part of the blood of the rehabilitated patient, which contains specific antibodies against this virus.
Coronavirus disease, a set of closely related symptoms
Wuhan City Center Hospital doctor Li Wen Yang increased awareness of the spread of the new coronavirus, and then unfortunately infected with COVID-19 and died.
