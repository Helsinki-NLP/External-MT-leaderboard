Parliament has not ratified the amendment to the liberation of Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft to cancel the paragraph relating to the accusation of opposition leader Julia Tymosenko.
Deputies rejected in second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for having concluded a priori disadvantage agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not definitive and the court has to decide on the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymoshenko calls the judgment a political revenge of the regime and has caused a process of suspicion of court partiality also in the west.
The draft to cancel paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It took 226 votes to approve it.
Victory of Libya
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already its defeats.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is usual in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but whether they are moderate or radical.
The National Provisional Council has decreed the usual law of the Sharia and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight a hand is cut.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possibly unrespectful of faith are subject to death penalty.
It is the Qur’an that will unite the society composed of opposite tribes instead of the person of the dictator.
In Libya, such an order will rule as we cannot represent ourselves and as we won’t like.
But our way of living is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for the Libyan.
It is surprising that Islamist warriors accepted the help with recognition of unbelievable dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO attacks but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated at each attack.
When it comes to seeking the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served the Islam and our poiliticians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without this bringing any profits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly occupy Libya.
There is therefore no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crossed".
Without land occupation, oil companies will easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Per not so much and the West will eventually be able to pride in a protection of the interests of human rights.
So much that we can stop these sharia followers.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the target of investors.
A tornado of statistics occurred on Tuesday in Europe.
Each of the states has published the GDP information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The debt market beat all records.
Investors look not only to Italy, but also to Spain, France, Austria and others.
Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries’ statistical offices have earlier published their vision of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5% and France by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better than expected (a 0.3% growth instead of the 0.1% expected), however France a slight decline of 0.1% (this was the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter.
But the GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decrease in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts forecast.
The most important events:
The Czech economy had a growth of 1.5 percent during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy had a 0.5% growth in the third quarter, according to scheduled and periodically re-calculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union had a 0.2% growth between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had forecast.
The Greek economy dropped by 5.2%.
The return on bonds over ten years is 28.45%
Spain and Italy’s bond returns are rising to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
Czech bond returns remain below 4% while the situation is worsening in the region.
Votes are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the ultimate instance guarantee.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
They won Montenegro 1-0 and celebrated the qualification for 200 million.
The football team has achieved its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Chech and Guardians Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has costly defended with also a good share of luck in the second part his qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to Super Chech and Hero Petr Jiracek with 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification in the European Championship.
The Monténégrains found themselves under pressure until in the second part due to a precise Czech defense.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a prize of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams were hard to get combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers has not succeeded in breaking the Czech defense, which has responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Some hundreds of high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the Universities of Ispahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the Ispahan Nuclear Technology Center where uranium is transformed.
Thus they openly expressed that they would defend their country’s nuclear program at the danger of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
Israel a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, the aim of which would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Nutrition of an obese child: don’t take breakfast and take snack for dinner
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of school students have a weight above the average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the patterns around it are.
On the tables of obese children, for example, cranberries are found 50% more frequently than in families of normal-weight children.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with a awareness action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In small-sized families sports is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and participated 900 students from Czech primary schools.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", action supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have signed up to this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - taste- dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet," said one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and snack at dinner
Experts draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students’ families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone takes breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been is that a tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed more often.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the questioned children do sports regularly but for parents this is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from options offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
“The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal, in terms of a healthy diet.”
Among their favorite dishes there are a lot of cakes, meat and sweets.
“The most alarming thing is, in particular, a great preference for sweet lemonades,” it is said in the results of the survey.
For lunch, the pasta took the first place right before the white meat.
The children did not want fertilizers at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head to Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
“In the course of a review of a group of survey participants who had filled the questionnaire after the awareness session ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’, we witnessed a well-defined willingness to go towards a healthy diet,” the survey results indicate.
The most notable was for example when it comes to sweet lemonades because children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often choked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce the sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour or potato butter).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry about the fact that there was a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what was going to happen later.
The exhibitions of three professionals of the specialty, the dressing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the site.
And it will be worse.
The closer we approach the final exam and the more practical exercises and information awaits us.
And even when there are courses on Saturday and Sunday it’s really “bored.”
This time we have with the director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) dealt with how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy body, without a particular curve, the other of overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically ammuise wide arms, extend a neck or add the necessary curves.
We have so come to emphasize beautifully the character and also not to dress too visible of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin size.
For example, if there is a difference between size and hips in such a way that the pants or pants don’t pass at all, it’s worth doing it on a custom.
And you won’t regret it because the clothes that fall impeccably is inestimable.
In a custom jacket you’ll feel much better than in that that constantly slides, rolls and doesn’t hold on the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of cousus tissue, or even broderies.
Obviously there are a lot of examples of different appearances and I am happy that I have the whole week to sort all the information received.
But I also fear that I consider what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each practitioner received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the type of fashion of the personality, as well as its appearance.
I’ll have to “wear” Miranda Kerr, who you know of the Victoria’s Secret campaign.
In the bottom of me, it makes me pleased, because it’s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds in recent times (do not take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and cut from magazines or search on the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physics but also creates productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, mantles, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphist, told us about all this.
But this, until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision.
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse look to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphist and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one clothes differently.
Variability is primary for this example.
As for example this trench-coat that should be wearing in a classic way with a jean and a t-shirt like a light mantle but also it can also wear the naked body, with scarpins and take it in photo as a dress.
Or you just need to get back the handheld or collar and get a new look immediately.
“Play with this,” he emphasized.
But I appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
“You can then begin to counter it,” said Jakub.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements about fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for a fashion story that will have a dozen pages (that is, a dozen models) I must be ready to "retail" at least a fifth.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We have to count on this in the process of creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half of success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists’ services remains frile.
And the known faces sometimes consider them unnecessary (it is enough that I know something but what I seem to pass to the second rang).
And if someone gets to make a styling from our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he with a great probability dictates us a completely different size (more small) than that he actually has.
We then have to browse on Google and make sure if the bulevard information reports the celebrity in question, if it is weak or thick etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter, keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his closet and fill it with new elements you can't throw it all and tell him,My God what horror."
“You’ll find some things that you’ll find beautiful and he that you’ll advise with what to wear them,” says Mario.
This showed us concrete what should all contain what is called the "placovka" or the stylist's bag.
It is the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as shells, rolls for depilation, or even spindles, there is also nylon wire (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hates), special clips with which a cloth is closed in the back, if it is too big (the spindle or other type of graph is not usable because they could damage the clothes) or a coating kit.
So that we were not only people who listen but who tried something practically they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the soil could destroy, a fortiori to lateral.
And so we colled and colled.
We didn’t have the right to touch the brushes so that we didn’t hurt ourselves by inadvertance.
We really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me for my creation.
What I say is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course.
I start more and more to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run is struggling throughout America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race is transformed due to a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with in a routine morning trip to work.
This fulfills to a certain extent everyone’s ambition but it doesn’t serve anything if no one wants to do something more.
The new part undertitled The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed racing series and to get out a kind of game from playable parts that would not count only with points.
So we were curious how will be the passages added during which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As it is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different than expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the set goes down due to some unnecessary errors that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of an incomprehensible fainity by the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are taken into the adventure whose protagonist Jack has characteristic problems and to solve them start to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is done on a different route and the steps planned in different environments that differ quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful even though the graphic level is the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowed mountains is very pleasant visually.
The trials are more from time to time accumulated with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sand storm that sensitively decreases your visibility.
Then in the mountains you need to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Besides this, the different races are well arranged each other behind each other.
There are only a small number of them, but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to overcome the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the chronometer) and then again you are waiting for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enters the game and who tries to make you the situation difficult.
The new one is out of the vehicle.
This is rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack escapes in front of someone and you need to help him by typing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is this because this element is not at risk of disturbing and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that accumulate the game.
The model of driving is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary nowadays, but it cannot be said that it is negative.
When it comes to realistic simulation you will have to go to see elsewhere.
But although we can find better in competition the driving model goes very well with the type of race design.
So everything is ok.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
With the differences of the behavior model, the collisions model is not yet to the point.
We don’t expect from this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don’t have, during a collision with any object, any idea of how your car behaves, so it’s not completely good.
During tight overturns you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy volts.
Or they find themselves in shadows.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you’ve broken your figure or you’ve gone out in the decor the game takes you back at the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 rebounds.
Once you have used the 5 restartes you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it’s more a tool, for the case where something doesn’t happen right, than something you can truly rely on.
Sometimes rebounds don’t help and you need to find the solution by remembering the piece of the route in question.
The great hic of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that must pass in a certain way, otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given place of the "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration that you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute in delay.
What makes you angry are situations when you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either put yourself on the side and turn them down or freeze.
It doesn’t matter if you go ahead of him because it’s “calculated”in such a way that for the given situation it always happens close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
During all the time of the game, you get to some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you run on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass before you at any price.
When he passes in front of you he hides you the sight of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you get into collision a lot of times.
It can be understood that the goal of this game is to do something fascinating and full of adrenaline,but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it’s a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don’t have the time to follow everything that’s happening.
And it’s the same if it’s because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there’s no chance to get bored or something else.
The original idea is the car change during the races.
You need to be careful about the petrol pumps on the routes as you can change the car but most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big U.S. cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic trails on very technical routes for example on the lake roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know of the adventure, goes very well with the main regime of the story.
You will not only receive medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This connects online with the Autolog function that among other things compares your achieved results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the hardest hits to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the metro tunnel (it looks like) where you ride in the dark on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a metro branch that sends you the car directly to the railroad.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days to see if someone really thought about when creating this game or if the authors really take us as fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra,but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super.
What annoys is that in more extreme situations, the image does not keep the level and in some cases in a tragic way.
This mainly applies to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid image is no longer useful to you.
The sound is good and the track is available.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the youngest audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but we can expect no one to buy the game for music.
Need for Speed: The Run is a big deal.
If the game didn’t have these stupid errors we could say without fear that it’s the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it is not finished.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for the mistakes to put you in the eyes with the strength of an airport reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave as negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically suppressed the balance between institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a war.”
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms and all players get used to their new role," Milena Vicenova began her exhibition at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations in such a understandable and visible way that a large number of lecturers from the Charles University Faculty of Law could envy her, she showed how much she takes her motto "comprehensible and openly about Europe"very seriously.
Madame Vicenova honored the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent president of the European Council.
“From the beginning the criticism sounded that he’s fade, that he’s a round-de-cuir, that he can’t fulfill any mission, and I have to say that he’s breathtaking everyone because he holds his role to perfection.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, how to communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the leadership to take on Europe.”
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of a response to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "Which telephone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the unity and greater readability of the EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our syrecky (cooked paste smoothie that feels very strong)
Madame Vicenova also stated the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency two years ago success.
The Czechs resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis, or organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the governance as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of Mrs. the Ambassador, "the activity has beat its full"not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved now.
It is also necessary to approve the new seventh budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and in view of savings, which branch will have the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be solved in the framework of future negotiations.
The Ambassador reminded her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe".
“I really don’t like the abbreviations, the strange words, the jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or tordus cornichons, differently large bananas, or that no one has prohibited us from making syrecky.”
It wants to better exploit the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
It is also unfortunate to see such a small representation of the Czech Republic in the European institutions.
The fault, according to her, is due to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their incapacity to write a motivation letter and a weak support from the Czech party.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she submitted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
“Think me, when the Polish, the Hungarian, the Slovak come to me, this French tells me, ‘Hey, what do you do there, what does this group of Visegrad still do?’ and he’s not happy at all.”
According to Madame Vicenova, in the near future, new hard budget policy rules are waiting for the member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not multiple-speed Europe, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the euro area and others outside the euro area.”
“We have the Schengen space, we also have the Institute of Strengthed Cooperation.”
First, it was said that the countries who want it cooperate with each other and those who don’t want it remain in their corner.”
“There will be a lot of institutes of this kind and there will be a truly two-speed Europe,” Madame Vicenova explains.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the foundations on which all issues that have an impact on the EU should be discussed among all EU members and not only the eurozone memes.
History of a brand:
IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expresses the IBM strategy closest, the closest would be “the long-term.”
For a wide audience, IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was thrown by the company’s first head, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for little as people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" has become the footprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
It was the foundation of the care company’s culture developed by Watson.
For us, IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it still remained faithful to its basic values and nevertheless didn’t be afraid to change all the others around it.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will even more," said for the birthday the current CEO of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the thirty years, began to take care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only among the first American employees to have paid holidays, an employer paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed reward system for inventors and merchants.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The society was at the beginning great in the discovery of talents—as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the mind of the anti-discriminatory strategy as it will be a woman-Virginia Rometty-who should replace Palmisano as head of IBM.
She has been working with IBM for thirty years and currently occupies the position of Chief Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has done what is called jamy, the brain storming online from which many future strategies and innovations come from.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the company there are 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a safe position in the field of business.
“Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather than an institution than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technical firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world by using its technology,” added Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM – or the “Grand Blue”, as it is known in the United States given its slogan – in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the world’s largest firms.
It’s obviously the most versatile technology firm – it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, counseling services at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
It owns many patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
His discoveries include, for example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the disket.
With $220 billion this year, IBM became the second-largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Viewed in advance
It’s not all the innovations and manufacturing that had the preference of the customer and of the time – for example, IBM failed to bet on a clean OS/2, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the move forward you cannot emotionally stay hanging on the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don’t work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor that is at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technological perspective
In IBM’s income, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a predominant place.
However, yet in 1990 it was with more motivation of participation the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, during that period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technology.
It continues to invest and even since 2008, when it for the first time overcome the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the prescriptions of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the big economic crisis also increased its volume of investments.
It appears now that IBM passes the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM stock has risen from 2008 in a rocket of 120 percent, the firm’s net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
IBM’s story: From cheese shells to flights into the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 – initially it was a brand used by a branch of a company in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as, for example, the old "points", the pendles that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided the Board of Surveillance of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competitive company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then made a shadow to the founder of the company – it is on Watson’s ideas that rely so far on the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the company in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machinery for business and trade – from cheese and meat cutting machines to casinos.
During the first four years during which Watson led, the turnover multiplied to $9 million and the company began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the company that after 40 years of leadership it was his son who occupied the chairman, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM’s people and computers helped NASA to guide the flights into the cosmos – on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company from Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years - is the concept of Smarter Planet "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas that are not yet exploited, such as transport and urban management.
When it comes to the field of commerce, IBM recently developed a "Smart Commerce"platform that helps traders to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory as well.
It founded its branch in the Czech Republic in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno’s strategic outsourcing center.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with the recognition of speech.
Rychtarova about his unfaithful husband:
You can keep this eagle, I don't want it anymore.
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said it’s over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph will wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can return home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in the summer to Bartosova in her house, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move from Ricany, Pepa did not withdraw the singer.
And he admitted in public that he loved him.
Over time, Darina resigned, accepted her husband’s bond and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing with whom her husband is sleeping.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome him on the door of the house.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my old elephant loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova said, showing that she has separated from her husband but that they are only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’ll stay with Iveta and I won’t change.”
“My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it.”
“The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy.”
“We talk with Darina in a completely normal way but we don’t sleep together,” Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she's going, with whom and if she has a connection.
I know that it’s my fault, I fell in love with “Iveta and I take on myself all the responsibility,” Joseph concluded.
The worst faults of women: does this affect you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical defects of women, all, one and the other, are able to get them "from their hand".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female vices that succeed in pumping the blood from the veins of men.
The purchases
Your half gives you comments that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one clothes a week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of sold?
In your case, you can talk about purchases as a defect.
Some women think they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you’ll say, which would resist the leche-vitrine of clothing stores, to look for yourself beautiful clothes and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for men.
Remember just how many times you told your spouse that he is waiting at the entrance...
Continuous dissatisfaction
“I’m not too big?”
“I’d need to lose at least 5 pounds – should I start doing sport?”
“I like you?”
Do these phrases not remind you of something?
Yes to?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed by their appearance.
It’s not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisoning.
Cleaning and cleaning in the first place
It’s like an infinite manicure.
Wash the windows, pass the dust, clean the soil, make dust, decay the bathroom - and that twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have salted the washroom, scratched the living room glass, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In the event that you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and purity should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for purity can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of Sapa
“And with this overwhelming used in the rubber.”
“Do you want to wear these old socks again tomorrow?”
“A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground.”
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you’ll really break it down.
It’s obvious that you don’t think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew it, women’t have to do so much work.
Confusion and persecution
Defamation, persecution, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are focused on relationships and so are pleased to deal with subjects such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Per each of us leaves a little harmless persilage out here and there.
The hand on the heart is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persist, even disregard others and are dangerous for their surroundings – especially in work in a women’s collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey attacker Jagr has participated twice in the Philadelphia victory during the Monday NHL ice match in Caroline and is again the leading productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who has made a further pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr, also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big evening.
“I told him before the match that he would give his hat-trick.”
“I felt it.”
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second attack by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes goals for the palet and presented it to the shooter Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a drop, but the beginning of the second game belonged to the Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
“I love to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said about his center.
“I’ve never thought I’d play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him.”
“I am really happy with that.”
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years in the NHL the other players in the team have tried to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference from a goal.
Matt Read did not exclude other complications that ended with two against one.
“Prong made great attacks in our area.”
“He tapped on the palette, I took the speed and (Read) went to the distantest corner of the cage.
“I’ve tried to hit him and I’ve got it,” Voracek describes the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he came out in second third due to a injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians didn’t hold in front of an experienced defendant their advance of two goals lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It’s the fact that the back line was sick that mostly disturbed the local coach rather than lost points because they played the match only with 5 defenders.
“It is null.”
“We played the match only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.”
“But there’s nothing to do, it’s like that,” said Jacques Martin.
“The replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn’t resist.”
“We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area.”
For this we had limits,” added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defendant who took part in the thirteenth Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How have travel prices changed since 1989
Until 1989, there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel especially in the countries of the socialist block, because the travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for vacation in Eastern Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination to the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist block (as well for the Czechs) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered travel to the West however it was necessary to make the hole all night with a bed bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for currencies which was the condition for traveling to the west was rejected to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czech currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain funds without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many countryside houses and chalets that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The Czech travel has experienced a major revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in Eastern Germany and Bulgaria were the maximum,the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are unconscious today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in neighboring western countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits mainly in Austria to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechs could not travel by air to the west for a long time that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical trait of a Czech trip was at that time to bring with yourself its own conserve food, salmon, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the exchangeability of the Czech crown which finally allowed our tourists after decades to be able to freely buy Western currency.
Our living level as well as average wage have increased which caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to the growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare tours with charter airlines that thanks to contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs had non-visum connections with almost most developed countries around the world except the EU that later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the post-revolution tourism history, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic was prepared.
Since this year as each year direct air charters take Czech tourists to the remote hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU removed the Czech tourist visas and allowed our country to be fully included in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including the attached charges.
The general assembly must find its president but it risks to end with a situation without a solution "a pat"
Nearly 5 months already the Czech football is without President and it risks that Ivan Hasek's successor to the head of the Czech Football Association is not yet known after another General Assembly that is scheduled to take place Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting procedure to be carried out.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the leadership of Czech football.
Hasek gave his resignation in June and during his departure he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the after-Hasek era football has returned back to differences between the Chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague as the negotiations remained blocked and it was not even discussed how to vote.
There was no agreement on the fact that who has the right to vote in the General Assembly—only, he says, the statutory representatives or also the full-powered officials.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the help of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue on the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round in order not to fall into the pat.
"The apple of disagreement lies in the following fact: either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, in the third round wins the one of the candidates who has received the most percentage of votes in the Chamber for which he is candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers will win.
And the Czech party studies the condition that the winner should have the two-thirds of at least the percentage of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of the two previous tournaments and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits who understands the objections of the moral party and according to which it would be best not to change the regulations and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also agree even though he considers that the settlement of the elections established according to the statutes favour the most Pelta among all candidates.
“I wish that we vote as much as possible according to the association’s statutes.”
"So that there are not yet sacrene ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is first candidate and who in his exhibitions has defined himself primarily against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," adds Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience in the field of football management both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tight.”
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are trends to want to change the drawing regulations."
“This could again cause a blockade in the General Assembly.”
“I still hope that the healthy reason will win,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement with all the parties.
Some reunions should take place directly in Montenegro but which can say if the entire football direction will be complete for the match.
The special flight in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, among others, had to travel to Podgorice, did not depart for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the Executive Committee on the ground of repressions.
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the split parties within the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state donation, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports that must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the struggle for the presidency because he does not see any correct candidate.
If Plzen football leader Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put in campaign for this high position.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I struggle for him and I don’t present myself to the election.”
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT that would a priori be given favourite for this election.
Paclik also emphasizes that in case he would win the elections he would hold this presidency only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the job an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
“I’ve talked with people who would have the profile,” he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with the Czech football at the moment."
“I would like to change this image,” he added.
What, they say, worries mostly Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man with the renowned counterversy who is known in the background as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is unacceptable that Pelta occupies this position of president.
“If he wins, the current state will remain and there will be nothing new in football.”
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flight trader, it would be even less favorable to football," Paclik said.
What shocks him again is the fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced a few years ago during hearing as part of an investigation on a corruption case, for which Pelta went out without any punishment.
“I don’t know what prestige Pelta would bring to football.”
“And how would we be seen in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said Paclik, who said some time ago, “if Pelta becomes president, I sell the club of Plzen.”
If Paclik triumphs on Thursday’s vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same.
“He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go.”
“He has great capabilities.”
“He would be able to present himself, for example, as the head of the representation.”
"But as a manager of the association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik who in September attracted great attention when he spoke for the cancellation of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his capabilities to lead private firms and he also leads since last year the Plzen club which with his support in May last celebrated his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the sport world and to bring a certain culture to it.”
“I would freeze the influence of some stakeholders who, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which leads to situations of bad taste,” Paclik added, who does not shake his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
He would also consider a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power with high-level policies would allow to get for sport more money from the gambling tax.
“This is one of the key points that the new president should deal with.”
“If it’s about gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current link to the Plzen club as something negative even if he himself claims that the AFRT president should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
“This is not the ideal.”
I don’t see any reason to transmit my actions from the Plzen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end the pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the disputes about the settlement for elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk and believes that today’s success of football representation should calm this governing before the vote.
Pelta before the September election that did not take place promised just to dedicate itself to national representation and to obtaining funds if he was elected.
He decided to be a candidate in the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday.”
“They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association,” he adds, but he is above all connected to the Jablonec club, he has worked a lot of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is an euphoria that ruled at the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone noticed.”
"If there were not all these different interpretations, we would have already had a president since September," Pelta says.
It is precisely the review of the most important document of the civil association that has taken all the attention of the delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I’m ready to take all responsibilities in the event that it doesn’t work.”
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," added Pelta.
Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he acknowledges given his training in law and that he knows relevantly that his opponent-candidate will be his first Vice President.
He has not even attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He has evolved in football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"It's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from competitions of the lowest level to national representation.
It should be a footprint for football.
“And I would also strive to end all the affairs that start with the Bohemian or the continuation of the corruption scandal.”
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his nomination to the head of football would not lead to any change of people.
"I should get acquainted with all the employees," he told Strahov where there's a understandable nervousness since there's no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round we will succeed in overcoming it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader in its head," as Pelta optimisticly stated two days before the probably decisive day for his official career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT will begin to work hard
"If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected New President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not like a lot of people, it seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected we will begin to work hard.
He wants systematic changes and the members of the Executive Committee to be responsible for the different fields of football.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As a president, I want to take care of football as a whole.”
“International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and performing football for youth.”
"But I don't say I'm going to do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific field.”
“And I’m going to distribute difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward.”
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
“About me, I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put me in the wheels and issue doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
“Many people have told me that I shouldn’t give up because they’d give up too.”
“It’s a trust I can’t betray,” he says.
What motivates him, they say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“There has been a lot of work over the past two years and I don’t want to let it fall.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I don't want anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will not return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in a systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
“Behind him are people who play football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen.”
“You can blame me for a number of things, but you can’t tolerate one.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only with those who have been chosen.
And he confirms again that he will only be a president for the Czech Republic.
“And if anyone says the opposite, I’m ready to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to consider the second division to be divided into two parts, the one Czech and the other Morave whose winners would be in the first division.”
"There would not be a situation as it is currently with only three moravish teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, has entered the competition for the presidency, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel the support of the Czech Chamber that has chosen me as its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," Rajchl said, who is considering among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiations of contracts with television and on the game law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault to all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footballer would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year.”
"If he was elected he would continue in what has been started by Hasek and would not make a remarkable change among the people in the committees."
"He't want to break his success," said Rajchl who was evaluating his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
by Julia Stanek
Pataugeoires in optics of ovni, beautiful swimming pools of Budapest: Whoever travels across Europe can experience his blue miracle – and after turning around the city or taking a long walk – can let his tired legs rest in gas-water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip over the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missed in her baggage: her bathroom.
Extended on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged couples, and swimming against the Putten marble that waited for her on the other side of the pool and missed to admire the meticulously restored New Art of these converted swimming pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased her, she noticed in her book without delay all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joyes of the Bath." Munich's municipal covered swimming pools, historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places respectively in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old Germany is a true fervent of the bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn’t have much interest in sport but he feels attracted to the water in a completely different way.
It’s annoying that swimming fans have to contemplate blue squares and accommodate themselves with Javel’s water shining while joggers breathe the fragrance of epicéa forests or can listen to the joyful birds of the park.
“I wondered one day why the swimming pools should actually always be so ugly,” the Vienna woman said.
“So I started a collection of beautiful baths.”
The water surface doubles the architecture.
A dive in a swimming pool and the volatile sauna oils - the well-being factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders were given a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
“It is, on the one hand, transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building.”
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high waves, multicolor squares, tremplins.
The small format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it gives the desire to make a jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
In addition to splendid well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in a natural cavern in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose bassins are filled with water containing alcali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a Zurich bath roof we have the whole city in its eyes, you can admire the snowed Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski track.
Per the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from the three open plates, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal rises to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Javel's water smell doesn't emerge from all the swimming pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emit a smell of sulfur, from the Árpád-spa to the Hungarian Bekescsaba emits a strong smell of oil, which it’s hard to believe, to find yourself in a spa health.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon fits you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slide in the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricated ground.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
Looking through the window of the New Art Building in red-white-yellow, she observed the flowing of bad herbs between the squares.
She observed a opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only the neo-Roman elements that come out since its design in 1844, but also an alhambra-style hall that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the swimming pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it originates from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a great performance to blend so different construction styles into such a formidable unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, immersion in the thermal swimming pool is apparently just a small question.
Agricultural speculation
The Bank of Germany detailed the speculation on raw materials
by Christian Teevs
Does the Bank of Germany abandon its raw materials speculation?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the group will then draw out the consequences.
The Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann emphasizes in this article that global raw materials stock speculation pushes prices up and that banks share a complicity to global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign concretely aligns against the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, although large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The raw materials speculation was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share the opinion that the bettors have taken off the offers and demand – and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism differently from the U.S. competitors: He promises to investigate the accusations and says, "No case is worth putting on the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will indicate the consequences to be taken.
This could result in a reduction in the raw materials market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode greeted the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “The speculation on the rise of food prices shows in a draconious way how much today’s banks harm the general interest.”
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be under obligation today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculations," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it’s about hungry people or whether the Deutsche Bank’s reputation is on the stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board will not change anything to what is scheduled within the Board of Directors.
Ll could improve its brand image by giving up controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he's hard to worry about it - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would stop investing in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires to 1001 people.
Only 11 percent found it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers investments for which food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also take personal consequences if they learned that their bank is participating in such transactions: one in two would, after the survey, terminate all investments for which money is injected into raw materials speculations.
43 percent would not recommend such a bank to their surroundings, 49 percent said they would reflect on terminating their account to change banking.
The 21st House in Vienna
The flag that moved
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the World Exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell in ruin.
It is now reopened and holds an exhibition house.
If you are enthusiastic about a post-war modern architecture, its bright shapes, its glass hangars, its vibrant and bold walks and its new construction materials that are typical of the belief to technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer's pavilion for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a good and famous example of this.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the “Grand Prix d’Architecture” for its steel and glass, light and suspended construction.
Construction is seen to date as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent bull-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Southern Vienna Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become more and more degraded.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance to any point of view.
The new departure was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among other things in her youth as an art skateboard, then at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she well conducted the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established its exploitation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation has the same name have been exhibited there, a cafe and a library are located there, and a office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the performance, Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensitively expanded Joseph Olbracht's secesion and that he had won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was "an extremely important place" place where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his trip to Vienna and by his change in use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the"building was a "energy gap," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, the insulating glass reinforced in glass fiber was placed and the roof was replaced by a particular safety glass.
Thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two undergrounds have made place to the new exploitation, a light panel shed between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The outer doors of the original have remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against the red-brown colour.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
“Sometimes good and cheap materials were to be found, and they also like the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw floor in the underground.
Despite all the barriers, problems and transformations, the building has remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and, despite all, wants to “reveal good consciousness.”
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden is just the "central station" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: the 21st Century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Center, and as it is said, she already negotiates with the city to get a site in the neighborhood of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the Deutsche Bahn railway company will spend more than 70 million in this regard this year.
The newspaper "Bild"-Zeitung in advance, invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of approximately 300 million euros would be planned by 2015.
This should allow a better availability of vehicles and the railway network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the deforestation of railway facilities and quests is expected to double and increase to 16,000 people.
The goal is to get rid of the snow and ice cows until the beginning of the service phase and 90 percent of the road equipment needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the station chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had huge problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for permission from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years what to do, since it has to check the ICE trains axes more frequently at the workshop, after an axes break occurred on an ICE in the central station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" has paid millions of penalties to the US.
After the case of head Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this sector giant catches it further in the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison $145 million (106 million euros), to resolve a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage documents.
The regulator of the financial markets NCUA carries to large banks a whole series of accusations, and that they have incited cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost tremendous value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
“We are pleased that we have been able to find a solution in this matter, without the parties starting a trial at the court,” said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank has not recognized any mistakes in comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a $20.5 million payment.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in case of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damages of several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks in part and in the summer he assigned before the court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is “Mortgage-backed Securities”.
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bull broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the summit of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events date already a few years, at the moment a storm breaks on the U.S. banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made numerous complaints to obtain repairs or to punish faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, both U.S. State Real Estate Financeers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having profited in nature in mortgage transactions of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint with the FHFA, which is a number of transactions of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask, that Frankfurt responds to "substantial claims" but without mentioning a precise amount.
Deutsche Bank has rejected the claims as unjustified and says it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett to Increase $10 Billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests huge amounts in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares for a value of more than $10 billion.
Until then, the great American investor Warren Buffett continually explains not to invest in IT companies, given that the long-term developments of companies only make bad forecasts appear.
However, he has read IBM’s reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and computer systems for other companies’ IT sectors.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a Knight attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, IBM’s IT activity is granted the right to now be called “Mr. IBM”.
Because Buffett today revealed to the CNBC Economic Broadcast, that he has purchased since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Her investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a big shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had secured reasonable profits.
“You’ve done a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has long put on profitable IT services as a "exploitation of accounting centers."
The pioneer of computer science, over 100 years old, offers both software and consultation as well as highly performing business computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says that he only invests in the companies he understands the business.
But on the contrary, Buffett is rather attacking the rail, lubricants and machinery manufacturers.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has 80 subsidiaries and shares with a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old regained in the 1960s the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and raised it to the rank of one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of earning money valued him the surname of "Oracle of Omaha".
After Buffett’s investment announcement, IBM’s shares rose by one percent on the stock market.
"Big Blue", as it is also known as IBM, has a stock value of more than $220 billion and is among the most valuable technology companies in the world with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he does not want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable.
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubt the state of German law.
A newspaper even talks about a “bloody ideology”, which would now be renewed.
The assassinations of eight Turkish citizens and a small Greek company in the years 2000-2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For for many Germano-Turks the spectrum that was long believed to be dead reappears: since the Mölln fire attacks in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more comparable violence with this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
If there is a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been discussed.
The extreme right-wing network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology," "This was the title of the internet publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the contrary, emphasizes that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned about the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right burberry.
It is reasonably that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration to the victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
It was just two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with joyful colors that cohabitation had been placed on stage, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a gips: “the gift of Germany for its 50th anniversary” this is the title of an article on the Turkish platform – “Haber X”, which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also, the German release of the "Hürriyet" is not deprived of taking out univocal conditions.
"It begins to puer," This is the title of Ahmed Külahci's chronicle.
He emphasizes that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and contributed significantly through their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
Police’s action was very critically perceived on the German-Turkish forums and they later discussed the success of their investigations.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to do research in some suspicious extreme-right environments, the authors are surprised.
More than one shows himself ready at least to rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be broken, there will be no more to the migrants than self-defense and weapons."
“This will be the best self-defense.”
“Internal peace in Germany depends greatly on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network,” Selen writes.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has more clearly shown to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, to which disbelief and distance by acts of violence could result.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes.
Previously it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks that the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish head of state, made himself represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how much taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the unbelief of many German-Turkish people towards the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate the extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Bank of the Lake of Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and at the same time patins from one crisis to the other.
It is a German man who has to lead.
This is not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was known in July, that he would occupy in 2013 a as spectacular post: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and profitable career.
Axel Weber publicly greeted, greeted; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its solidity recently obtained and made passing friendly observations on future colleagues.
“The UBS has succeeded in the Turnaround.”
“I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
In September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS trader in London had distorted all the bank’s security systems and flamed about €1.7 billion.
UBS head Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the UBS’s Board of Directors has since been considered as suffering – and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We’ve already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will take the presidency again already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more economist and bank president, and he would need a period of adaptation.
Once upon a time, he then takes the responsibility for a bank’s strategy, which has just proved again that it has long deserved the title of “Europe’s largest scandal bank.”
In fact, the UBS is huge on the one hand – until recently, it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, it has been pating for years from one scandal to the other.
Nothing seems to save the so proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also rough, she had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of bank investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a easy customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world’s largest banks.
This made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later banking professor for many years in Zurich tells me: “I’ve always taken the UBS as a good banking model before my students.”
"At the present point of view, we wonder: how could I simply have mistaken so much?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something didn’t turn around at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli retreated surprisingly, which was so far considered a high-intellectual as well as a giant banker.
A few months later, I wondered why he had gone.
The bank’s division had flamed with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this she actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have bordered the eyelids: an untransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed in silence, to the point that it was never even known its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it worsened.
The bank had to announce billions of losses again, with the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second best paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigning.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought the UBS of tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds that could be converted into shares, for which it could become co-ownership of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was shocked - because it noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We couldn’t save the UBS again,” says the bank researcher, Geiger.
After the first disaster he followed the second.
Just a few months ago, the UBS had resigned due to a tax dispute with America and declared ready to publish the data of the easy customer, who had frauded the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it has helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of the chairman of the board and the chairman of the board.
The exodus of customers’ money.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business sectors: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to the aid to tax fraud.
And, as there was a somewhat quiet return, and as it was thought, that the UBS would go out of it, it followed this unhappy story of securities traders: a single securities trader flames €1.7 billion, before the bank realizes that something doesn’t turn round.
And it is published: with the risk management in the investment bank it still seems not to work.
"With the Adoboli case, it was possible to find that the risk management has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the financial director of a large German bank is sure of this: “The problem with the UBS is that it has no risk control in hand.”
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long assumed their function, that of becoming the guardian of the great wealth of the world: not too big risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unbeatable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a noble chocolate.
The UBS power plant in Zurich is still in line with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank – it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at the Central Station of Zurich, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowed heights of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the rental stores are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's, you can find them here among the traditions Swiss stores as well as those of the Sprüngli dessert.
For centuries Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank to the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We get to the UBS entrance hall through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a big label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another out of the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers he does business as well with the two major banks.
The UBS would have become too big, he finds - especially in bank investment, where the Anglo-Saxon would also be spread.
The Switzerland has nothing to say.
“And even though, they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon morals.”
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the breakdown: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of the sub-prime as the big Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country with seven million inhabitants undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined an enormous group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland – and continuously recorded an increase.
What helped, was that the two different predecessors of the UBS have completed: a rich, but lethargy bank with as a strong point the asset management in Zurich and a poor, but already stronger internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the UBS ascension: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former chairman of the board.
“I’ve always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the great, modest intellectual, who understands it very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who broke a way to the top with bank learning.”
But Ospel would be trusted until the end at Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have done a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
“This is a tragic fall.”
Per a tragic.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the leaders’ meetings during which the Wuffli Group leader has always spoken the same word: to destroy Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the world’s most powerful investment bank.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which documented at that time the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to rise up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In currencies and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
The corporate counselors, who had the responsibility for this, however, highlighted a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the bank jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have shortcomings in the level of U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS started an adventure, which almost cost her life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed and passed American mortgage-based valuable documents – but that has also retained risks.
Even when other banks have long sought to go down.
“But in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there,” says Geiger, the bank expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave, when ending the attempts turned out to be harder than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become executable and are so far banking.
The man who leads the big bank has a task almost impossible.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to go so far.
But the investment bank has to move strongly, as far as it is clear so far.
On Thursday, the head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present to the world his future strategy.
Italo-Switzerland, 51 years old, was only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed: he must sustainably run the UBS affairs, the Bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of advancement in the mid-1990s.
He cancelled 3,500 jobs.
But that won’t be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has already asked.
He publicly said until now only that he was going to look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
the next year.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, just confirmed this prudence: "It is not yet clear if Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades old principle to the wind and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His more than $10 billion investment in IBM supported the stock price of this traditional group, and allowed it to score almost more than 1% against the trade management trend.

Intelligent corneals spread in cities
In many places, frogs are considered a “bird problem” But experts say these very intelligent animals have not been allowed to go out of cities for a long time.
Some love them, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible. The corners have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplied due to the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote against the “bird problem” is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on the corners, experts said it was no longer possible to chase the frogs from cities.
Experts from all over Germany have discussed possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
The protectors of nature were based on the problems of cities also on the exode of protected frogs: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, arrangement and defeat of typical cover trees made the life difficult for birds.
The corners are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 couples in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative advertisements due to the corneal massacre in the region.
Critics found the catch of the birds in traps and killing them with gourdins brutal.
“Normal expulsion, expulsion, has nothing to do,” said the city and landscape planner of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nids with the help of water under pressure or the defeat of the trees, often produces unwanted consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
“The animals are distant, the large colonies are divided and they are spread to other places.”
The evasion is imaginable only in exceptional cases as in hospitals, retirement houses or schools.
“We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them.”
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Designable is a combination of the eviction of the animals to an aversive packaging and hanging offers, so that they can reinstall elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospects “information panels instead of scratchers” in order to establish completely different relationships with them: “We can finally better hold a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence.”
Jürgens co-founded the Asheberger-Road-Educative Corbels at Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing about the life of these very intelligent freals.
This project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "This is a great number of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
Animals’ intelligence and skill are legendary: Frogs not only use working instruments to get to a dish but they manufacture themselves their tools as working instruments.
Ethologists from the University of Cambridge tested four frogs recently, how far the bird intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crush a shell with stones to reach a larve.
Without a lot of training, they clearly recognized that a stone had to have some thickness and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the intelligent horns then had to solve a more trapped problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small seal with a larve.
The birds could not reach their butter with their bec.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the small seal of the small tube.
Three of the four tricks are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo to win Portugal in the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a blow of the Bosnians and Turks remained unsuccessful.
Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the eliminatory tournaments at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.

Ronaldo sent a 30 metres in advance in the mailing.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting qualities and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of Manchester City's English championship, initiated a head ball directed to the bottom of the transversal bar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, Ergolding’s arbitrator Wolfgang Stark is at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after Fabio Coentrao's action that Misimovic diverged.
But, after the break, the Vice-Champion of Europe of 2004 succeeded four hits and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had luck and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goal keeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflection a last minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9th).
Montenegro had its biggest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked at the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface just next to the Chech shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the world-class gardian of the Czechs already shot down, once again, the FC Seoul attacker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.

While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to leave his place in the 2002 EM third bank, the Croats were able to enjoy their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.

Selcuk Inan marked in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even buri the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic from Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.

Konstantin Vassilyev (57th) matched for the visitors.
Ireland pushed at higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good opportunity.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” said CEO Bill McDermott to his customers on a fair basis in Beijing.
The staff will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world’s leading corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this expanding country.

“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by complete information.”
Personal mass shooting
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that strike your heart.
A tip to start: carefully break this page and make it your page mark.
In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a mark during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the clouds of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book that he describes, with accuracy, as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion about the strategies and the material.
It’s not so much a book about what’s happened, he explains, that a “book describing how it could look.”
"Beauty and Sadness" summarizes the war-time experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young schoolwives and botanists to escalers, through doctors, ambulants and sellers.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some will lose members, become crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives flourish here like the curves of a church: while some are shut down, new ones are lighted up.
Peter Englund’s book distances from traditional history books.
He brings a denial to the idea that the First World War is summarized only by the terrible war of the tranches on the western front.
"Beauty and Sadness" skillfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and Eastern Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under bulbs; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tset-tset mus are an untreatable problem.
This book is exciting from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Katrina hurricane that sinks the cord.
When canon strikes hear away, and you’re a mother at home, stay or flee?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been enlarged by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sadness" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nursery in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young marine from the German High Sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrible or exciting, but they are the most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them are concerned with deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
Speaking the story of a German schoolwoman, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz. "
“Substitute cabin, false aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bands, wooden buttons.”
He continues on food replacement in Germany.
He describes “the meat made of rice cooked crushed in sheep fat (and ended with a false wooden bone); the tobacco made with dry roots and the dry skin of potato; wood shoe seeds.”
He affirms that "837 permitted replacement meat is registered in salts production. there are also 511 replacement cafes."
Some stories address honor and courage.
One American recognizes his own impulse toward wildlife and declares about war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were destined, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky at hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than claiming that such a paint is synonymous with civilization, and that there's no barbar behind your shirt stumbled and covered.
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die, and that no one will notice it or pay attention to it.
“When one is resigned to sacrifice himself, one hopes to have a public,” he writes.
This, unfortunately, is rather comparable to "a man sentenced strangled in secret".
Other observations relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict becomes more and more a history of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the early century bestiar: the well articulated and ideologically convinced mass killer, in well cut clothes, who executes his murder while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at any cost to catch a venarian disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front.
“We find the most grotesque expression in pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genital organs in the hope of ending in the hospital,” he writes.
“The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which means a lifelong blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund’s prose is flexible but not ostentatory, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he realizes the way the war has “started exclusively uncontrollable forces: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.”
People begin to wonder why their leaders make a war on them.
The best works on the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "Nothing New in the West", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund’s work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most accabling I’ve read in a non-fiction work.
I will not reveal it.
But it’s as if he had emerged from his book, captured with your hands this page where the list of people appears and burned with a lightning.
After a false first step, a thoroughly planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing revolt helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret for all except for some high-ranking officers as well as other informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be repeats of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the department’s regulations and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared to observe the course of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, in view of the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers get better training against the revolts – anti-terrorist measures consisting of moving a large number of police officers quickly – to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening on the East River side of Manhattan.
The orders given to move in the park were reached “in the last minute,” said an accustomed, referring to the operation as “a simple exercise.”
“The few police officers I know and who were called didn’t know they’d go to Zuccotti Park,” the person said in anonymous statement.
"The only ones to know they'd go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the police department."
The city was able to keep a lesson, from which the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean the park but were rejected by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood – dozens of officers used to the criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, in the way of migrants.
“It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people,” he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The recorded lights and messages of speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While community officers penetrated the park equipped with their clear blue wind cutting, many protesters simply gathered their stuff and left.
No tents were hit before 1h45, the police said, leaving the occupants time to gather their affairs.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrestations were needed.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said that the measure was taken solely for security purposes.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, hardly held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said the TV cameras trucks on Church Street, along the western side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police was moving west through the thick business searches of the protesters, including baggage, plastic grass and sheet bags filled with clothes, the sanitation department teams followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind them.
The few protesters who refused to leave were trapped. the images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp were hanging together.
Finally, two people were bound to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 p.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of them were “for public order and rebellion.”
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most skilled officer to be found on the site.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, though present, “not managed the operations,” Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police suffered along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a palm of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expanding the perimeter far beyond the Zuccotti park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Around 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vibrant events of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5:00 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protestant jumped on the capot of a police car. Other were seen cutting the tires of a police truck.
At a moment, a piece of counterplaque emerged flying from the crowd.
A police officer and a protestant were hospitalized.
Syndicate of School Aid Demands City for Dismissal
The syndicate, which represents hundreds of school aiders who lost their jobs last month, plans to begin a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools receiving disadvantaged students.
The prosecutors are probably the ultimate weapon of the trade union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aiders, parents coordinators and other employees, among the least well paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7th. Trade union leaders compared these dismissals to a political vengeance for not allowing the city to access a health care fund led by the working groups, and which would have allowed to close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
During a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, mentioning that the dismissals of school aid were not specified in any way in the budget.
Officers of the Council of the 37th District said they would fill out a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
The complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of black or Latin American origin, as most of the school aid that have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city’s law department, said that the municipality has not yet seen the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a record of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the trade union would bet on the number of dismissals in the schools of the city’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to a regular sub-financing.
While there are no dismissals on Staten Island, and just a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa facilities, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23th District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern District of Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aid employees at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of school students live in poverty, prosecution claims that "It's not a neighborhood of easy parents who can bring funds to fill the budgetary shortage."
The budget of the public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each disadvantaged student registration.
The syndicate also claims that high school directors may have been mistaken by certain terms in a memorandum allowing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "transition" to describe the action, although "transition" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the complaint project, "sixty-six parents coordinators have been dismissed", and "not only because of overtake".
Mission Completed: Congress finds agreement on Libya issue
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats have finally reached an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
There would be a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as the U.S. involvement.
The Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat – Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican – Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent – Connecticut), applying the Libyan people for their revolt and the U.S. troops for their “courage”.
“This resolution consists in honouring the courage of the Libyan people as they begin to reconstruct their country,” said John Kerry.
“It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties have come into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.
But the same day after the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure aimed at reducing funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress suffice annoyed to criticize the administration of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under his foot.
Congress’ indecision was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee’s resolution “feels the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination towards freedom” and “feels the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms "the U.S. national interest in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain all the support of the Senate’s Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators like last June?
Senator and Commission President Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment regarding the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have not yet been able to make their amendments approved but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent – the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate – and others are slight variations of a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of Representatives only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would “control federal spending.”
Some of these draft laws are identical, but give their supporters – including the new Republicans who want to get their CV gold – the chance to pride in being the “author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act (BUDGET CONTROL Act) approved in August last year demanded the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates during which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is permanently proposed, as well as the amendment prohibiting the drawing of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of states are opposed to it.
As long as the members have been willing to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The cadence slowed down compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but not beat," says Gabrielle Giffords in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after an armed man shot him to the end leading to Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday evening in a TV show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to first recover rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared in the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords fought to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show addressed his difficult return after the ball that broke his neck and broke the left side of the brain, passing through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt threshold.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and wounded thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and singed - and called her recovery "hard".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, replied “just well.”
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20", broadcast on the eve of the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special broadcast tracked the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his head scratched and a wide scratch on his forehead.
She can use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: “What?”
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords choked another word ("Toast") to ask for a change in her breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: you see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends every day two hours with the doctors, said not to remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading him an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for the first time for information about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and vigorously treated while waiting for the trial.
“There’s been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
“Hard, hard and hard.”
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, “I was beat.”
“So I would say, ‘Gabby, you haven’t been beat,’ Mark Kelly said.
You were just massacred.
And you will get out, recover and get back stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the people.
The event: a gala on Wall Street to gather millions of dollars for the homeless veterans of the city of New York.
Kid Rock has singed a ballade on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and sailors around him.
The crowd in costume cravate stood at his feet to acclaim him.
“The soldiers, men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, the organizer of the spring funding collection.
A high-level military present at the gala, in which also participated Admiral Mike Mullen, head of the U.S. Army, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were presented as a kind of orphan,” the military senior wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know it.
But it was not respect, it was mercy.
Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have established between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
A praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some soldiers say.
The public acts more and more as if it was sorry for men and women in uniforms.
“We’re not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of unfortunate spirits."
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who don’t want to look ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops from the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in confidentiality among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the fight with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service in two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were faced with insurgents and traveled to distant counties.
Others would wonder if "a angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who gave him the interviews subtilly asked if he would be able to hold the blow under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the battle.
“When you address the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian reminds when he speaks to his sons.
Military difficulties arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely congratulated by a country so unfamiliar with the army and who sees little direct advantages from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as in the Second World War,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a military.
The troops are recognized for the number of periods of service, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure against the rape
This week, a main hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complaints will prepare the next.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
She returned to her cabin at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room to drink a drink.
“C was a alarm signal,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
However, Texas has left its concerns.
I thought, no, he was 19 years old.
“He’s from Texas,” he said.
“I have to follow my intuition.”
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her behind, thrown to the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, will wait with anxiety for the judgment in a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether a trial against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Ranked in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by soldiers' colleagues. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided appropriate justice after alleged attacks.
Susan Burke claims to take it to the galonized soldiers, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the individuals in the position of"eliminating the culture of repressions?
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future court proceedings.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case – thus putting all her eggs in the same basket – she will initiate several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by the staff in active service.
“The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants,” the documents indicate.
The Department of Defense refused to make any comments.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still have not, officially, the right to go to the battle, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s troops play an increasingly important role, including in contacting with local women.
The result: in these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat situation.
It is time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in carrying out this fight: three other trials are ongoing in addition to her own.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Center prepares a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogyne atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of “personal disorders” attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave – a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women’s Action Network, a group for human rights.
His group launched a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to deal with the benefits requests for people who claim to have been victims of a sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded by the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. In fact, according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13,5% of the 19,000 incidents occurred that year.
The report published in March also studies the percentage of judicial proceedings: in 2010, 20% of the cases registered in the army were subject to a trial - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a series of trauma.
In Lyman's case, she informs the military police of the rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cutting in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a judge, in a trial during which she is questioned about her sex with her boyfriend earlier the day of her aggression.
Six people witnessed as witnesses of morality for the murderer, who ended up being released.
“I remember the day when the verdict was delivered,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
“I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember saying to my commander, ‘This was not his trial, but my.’”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unsuitable for service.
In January 2010, it was returned under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Whether the Lyman and other complainants case will go ahead or not, it’s a long story, says John Turley, a professor of law at the University of Washington’s Faculty of Law.
However, he notes, “I think they should be able to move forward.”
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction lies between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army has been behind for decades because it has not the same advantages and means of dissuasion put by responsibility.
“The chances are heavy against them... but it’s important that they try,” he adds.
These things change only when the good people have the will to fight.
If the trial doesn’t turn to their favour, Susan Burke, the complainant’s lawyer, will gather its hundreds of other complainants for further trials.
“We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until there is no reform,” she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged being caught by a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced in his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on the cyber space: he had spent a large part of the time before the attack on his computer, talking with some of the millions of nationalists who support the extreme-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy this summer, the researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy to connect to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t so difficult to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a report recently published by the DEMOS reflective group on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific accuracy – the way marketers have done it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of extreme-right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and colleagues were able to interrogate 10,000 supporters from 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
“This is a new way to do research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, youth and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just an example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflective groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all subjects that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I like", wall publications and statutory updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the "data supernova" generates a search explosion, increasing the number of searches whose site name appears in the title by 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you could not approach in the street.
"Before, when you tried to conduct investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," says Jamie Bartlett.
“Facebook avoids all of this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and deal with health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunk performance were much more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t deal with a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not be in another case unrecognized."
Facebook also continuously accesses the information of its users.
The data-care site team has studied statistics regarding the love situation and Valentine's Day, the rate of participation in the 2010 mid-mandate elections and a national happiness index (through the information only available - the digital freedom champions have long claimed that the site could make its treasure available to other people for search purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange to be able to play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey that they have not even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information differently than by passing through the Internet, there is anything else about it online.
"I don't think that a large number of users have already thought that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things,” says Neil Selwyn.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks a notebook and a pen are the best tools that can be used.
“Nothing will be able to replace the real world and the contact with people,” he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social, it is not in front of a computer."
“Cold and Inhuman” by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter when he first appeared at the trial in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Templars of Norway,” he explained in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
“As for the jurisdiction of the court, I refuse it because you hold your mandate of organizations that support a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I recognize the facts, but I am not guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "not wanted to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in jail for another twelve weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor all visits and correspondences very closely for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind the bars.
Everyone participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and unhuman," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian television channel NRK.
“I wasn’t comfortable, but I personally went a little forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark costume and a blue cravate, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a large "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy.
The July 22 attacks, therefore, seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the sadness or confusion that the whole nation feels.
"I would have preferred that he looks like a monster, but that's not the case," a parent of a victim said.
“It would have been much easier.”
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview in Cinema this Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing himself by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computer science.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a Steve Jobs interview recently found and which will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative mind had understood the processes and workflow of the products.
He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organogram enhancer - a man who believed that many business managers suffered from a "sickness leaving them think that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds."This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs’ death that a full video was found in the director’s garage.
This video, slightly upward, is the basis of the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to the cinema on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate deep interviews, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly enthusiastic to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to bring a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism rises, where he seems unattended to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him a bite to make him accelerate and move to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and tells his own vision of the future of computer science.
It’s a thing to read the posthumous ratings of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer in the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then puts them into practice.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
About how he learned to manage a company:
“For all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers are constantly the same, ‘oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That’s what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details about his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Confused about how the costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” assessed by the nose, then adjusted with a “variation” – he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
About the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that served to hack the telephone networks and phone free on a long distance.
The device has been the subject of many previously written, but Steve Jobs’ euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of ownership is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, passing a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while circumventing as many satellites as possible.
“We covered the ball of different things half a dozen times and you scream in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next,” Jobs explains laughing.
“We were young and through this Blue Box we learned that we could create ourselves something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn’t know much of both, but we knew how to invent a small thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have existed one day without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour he and Wozniak developed: he called to the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by making himself to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two complices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awake.
About his love for technology (and the start of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett’s number in the directory and sends him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. C" was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP employees visiting the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first ever designed desktop computer.”
He was as big as a bag, possessed a small cathodic tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was returned to HP and began writing programs for this machine.
Improvisation of Innovation:
In several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a headline.
At the beginning of his career, as he settles to sell a few printed circuit cards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 credit days, he should take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties he encountered in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember big disputes... I was screaming on them claiming that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I got enough, I went out and went to see a designer.”
Eighty days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and which proved incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that sweep:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would be wrong and lose control over their market share.
“Let’s admit that you’re working with IBM or Xerox, you’re making a better copy or a better printer, and then?”
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [this are these types of people] who end up leading and product-specialized staff are put away from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely ruined by people who can’t imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product – the required manual work.
That’s what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s.
They pulled the defeat to victory.
Innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge portion of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtles.
There are compromises to do... Some things you can’t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together.
It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved themselves the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with health law opponents as the court meet
The day the Supreme Court met at closed doors to examine the question of political discord, namely whether the opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed during a dinner sponsored by the lawyer’s cabinet that will defend the case before the Supreme Court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference aimed at discussing petitions for examination.
One of the cases concerned a trial initiated by 26 states against the ambitious healthcare reform voted by Congress last year, a law that was a point of gathering for conservative activists at national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected in March, and the result will likely be of nature to favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full growth at the time the court's decision will be made.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the US general applicant during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément’s legal office, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen offices that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-term group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another office that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that contested the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court's conference on the case.
It was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, Senate's top Republican and declared opponent of the health law.
The guests star at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct which regulates the actions of federal judges.
If they were so, they would argue by the Canon 4C code, which stipulates: "A judge may attend fundraising from law-related organizations and others although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honorary guest, or appearing on the agenda of such an event."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the case’s lawyers, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
“This violation of ethics and great indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, Chairman of Common Cause.
“The judges were drinking and dinnering and a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have cases in court.”
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds from this event dismantles any claims of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little concern for the critics claiming that they mix too easily court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, the conservatives claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general applicant of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her criticisms pushed Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan did not give any indications that she would do so.
Boeing records $18 billion order for airline aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-course line aircraft, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order covering 50 of its products.
It is, on the contrary, a whole deal when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and that the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of $18 billion.
Just as incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In the forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East airlines will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft of a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing the order of its history’s most expensive commercial aircraft – 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors.
It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai that has passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would increase the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that the company Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that flats with significant fuel savings and convenience for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is more than a billion dollars.
“It’s clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
“These customers in particular have an enormous value.”
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own a lot of their airlines.
So they have not only the means to pay these aircraft, but a rise in fuel price – usually harmful for airlines because it represents their highest costs – would not be so harmful for them as the country would make money with the rise in oil price.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or delay their aircraft orders when the oil price rises, Dihora.
“They have a natural risk cover,” he said.
Emirates' command strengthens Boeing's dominance on the large-power aircraft market and helps to stop the competitor Airbus' attempt to overthrow with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the aircraft exhibition comes four months after Airbus’ announcement of delaying the debut of the largest version of the A350, which rivals directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is delaying its starts to increase its push as its customers demand to increase its charging capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister struggles in Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the run for the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her attempt to access Michoacán's governor's positions during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favoured one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was the leader of the race for the post of governor of this western state.
“The intervention of the organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country,” Luisa Maria Calderon told radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They took the urns, installed road barriers... and forced people to vote” for the PRI.
PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until losing its presidency in 2000.
But he organises his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have distinguished only a little from Calderon, who was in the head of the polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, a candidate from his brother’s conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently occupies the functions of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
But violence continued.
A week before the election, a PAN mayor was murdered while he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates resigned locally from the campaign for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections seem, a victory will help the party in its impulse.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for the next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to come to aid in the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Manille-based BASD’s chief executive, said the two world’s fastest-growing economic powers had to “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He did not advise the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe’s difficulties with a “indifferent eye” and pointed out that an Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would “evite a long-term collapse of the world economy.”
“We are all together in this crisis.”
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain point, but it is not safe."
“So if China and India can help, let nothing prevent them from doing so.”
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously struck by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has dangerously risen and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised the fear that the global economy will fall back in recession, and has raised the call of major emerging economies to gather together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that the IMF would deliver any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the U.S. Financial Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – would provide greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
India's trade and industry minister, Anand Sharma, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area since its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital arrivals.
“No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to face and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to make an aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with 2 dollars a day, or even less.
“One day, they will find that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and they go on holiday in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr. Nag said the crisis in the euro area was at risk of causing "significant impacts" across Asia.
BASD’s forecasts of an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia in 2011/2012 now face “risk of loss” due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop rescue plans" to protect themselves from economic recovery and significant capital leaks.
Pentagon warns of potential defence reductions
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget compressions would ruin national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridor to Afghanistan’s battlefields, passing through civilian assemblies.
The Pentagon has already digested $450 billion reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more compressions will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting from what is called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"A such significant reduction, applied so without discernment, would make most of our ships and construction projects unexecutable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage the other modernization efforts," Panetta writes to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a certain number of our civil staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to the goal."
“These changes would shock the faith of those who support our soldiers and seriously damage our preparation.”
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"Al the war-time financing of the accounts of the contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
“The contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts that support war.”
“The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in payment delays to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disturbed.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequence of a sequel to the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as an uncertain world leader of military power.”
“We are strongly opposed to this draconic action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta’s letter was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is not that we should impose on ourselves."
"The seizure is a threat to the U.S. national security interests, and it should not have to occur."
Whether Panetta's letter and Senators' recent warnings increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, it remains to be seen.
Panetta was increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he reached himself at the Pentagon’s highest position accumulating years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with a coat, but not a core.
“It’s a ship without sailors.”
“It’s a brigade without balls.”
“It’s a hunting plane, without enough trained pilots.”
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of casernes, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers able to complete the mission,” Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed, poorly prepared and unable to face potential opponents.”
“In fact, it calls for aggression.”
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could “generate significant operational risks: deadlines for response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could go to the couperet, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bombardment, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and marine.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is a key step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at recent titles indicates how much deception and lies are omnipresent in everyday life.
Republican president candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of scam for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach has sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lies destroyed carriers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congress member and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has passed for an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrevocable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violating the financing of campaigns related to covering an extra-marriage bond.
And then, no one who has lived the story will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave the test answers to students in order to make themselves clear about their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How much deception do we face?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are wicked lies.
Another study has shown that strangers lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detection or detection of lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, let’s say, charades, where the goal is to cry: “I’ve got you,” the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a deep research of such projects, in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lies have been disguised.
The liars look at you in the eyes.
They don’t bear, red, or don’t always irritate.
Not to conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
A qualified lies detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time of response.
I have spent several years examining scientific outcomes in the vast body and always emerging knowledge of fraud, and it is clear that detection of fraud is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include employment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled in reading others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know, according to research, that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty to lie to you.
How can you say if someone lies?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is what we call “setting data markers”.
This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves his feet constantly so that they don’t launch unjust accusations when you see him moves his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for indications of verbal and non-verbal misleading behavior.
Consider these indications as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Cheating people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, look to a outlet, change posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated breath of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Questioners often wrongly indicate that the interview is finished just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Be careful with the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson has scratched using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Cheating individuals can also use a distant language: "I didn't have sex with that woman...Mrs. Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of “wood language” when answering a difficult question: “Well... to say the truth... if I remember goods... to my knowledge.”
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize fraud is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by scammers in their professional and personal life.
The controversial oil pipeline plan will be disrupted after the U.S. late approval threat
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico – raising the anger of trade unions while calming environmentalists – the company seeking to build the oil pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to put it on the rails.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will finally get the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it will delay its decision to grant a federal license for the project until it receives new potential route studies to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources.
“This is a real way forward,” said Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department would probably reject any decision until 2013, after the next year’s elections, although officials deny the policy involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's decision, and expressed his support for it.
The oil pipeline of 2,735 km would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the Alberta province to the Texas refineries.
To do so, it would have to cross six states.
It is hated by the ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the estimated 20,000 oil pipeline-related jobs.
But the lawmakers of Nebraska opposed this plan are pressing that a law forced the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquiver, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the ministry’s general inspector ordered a separate investigation of the examination process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser for Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly caused a young child to vomit of fear
A New York family claims that the Disco Patti LaBelle diva launched in a violent breakdown in the hall of their Manhattan building, scared their little girl to the point that she broke out of fear.
"Lady Marmalade's tirade scared the 18-month Geneviève Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of foreigners," her family said during the trial at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was the 10th November of last year when the stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife garden teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to find the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the hall of their building on the Riverside boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and had put her daughter for a moment.
“Somebody came behind me and said to me, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and I went to find her,’ she said.
LaBelle admonested with anger the pregnant woman.
"She told me in an aggressive tone: 'You should not leave your daughter near the door,' says Roseanna Monk.
“I answered him, ‘What you say or think doesn’t interest me.’
She became angry and began to use swears - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to spray me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
“I said to that woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’ the child’s mother said.
LaBelle jumped on her mother—who still kept Geneviève in her arms—and had to be held by her surroundings who led her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The girl was crying so heavily that she was vomiting, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for apologies from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint demands unknown damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family is planning to donate all the money received to a child cancer charity.
“The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his behavior,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially with a maternal teacher carrying a child of 18 months."
Climate Disadvantage Boosts Economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy collapsed
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the rise is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing billions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
The Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development reports that 582 million 835 hectares have been damaged, of which 78,03 per cent have suffered total damage and the remaining 21,07 per cent have suffered partial damage, the main plants damaged were vegetables, corn and corn.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year has been observed an accelerated increase, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 signals were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand signals unemployed, an increase by the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions carried out by public policy.
“What we observe is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a resource restriction by the legislation approved in Congress to fight money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy that they work to earn them, that they invest them and use them in something,” he says.
Prisoned migration
López Cervantes that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties in entry and second because when entering they already have a lot of difficulties in finding a job, these people stay here and ask for sources of work there, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the signal labour market is worsening considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the occupied population in this state works there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for deviation for the state are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the Synaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the State IED reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the third-party sector.
The debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July to the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the objective of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November there was no profit from debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employer sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of governance capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the Government of the State.
“The yield of Sinaloa’s economy during this year was really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said events such as the ice in the beginning of the year retained the state economy and restricted its yield and growth.
“The low economic flow is produced by several events, among which the ice, one of the main effects was a slow economy that doesn’t turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of e flow in the trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had,” he says.
Re-defining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state to more dynamic productive activities.
“In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa is detonated,” he said.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex emphasized the importance of establishing a vision of the future that canals the Government’s efforts better.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He that the current administration has shown advances in the way of managing public policy.
“There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we’ve done a lot and the Government is aware that there’s still a lot to do,” he said.
Condemned for 8 pounds of marijuana
A resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days fine for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic that the small traffickers sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on June 7, 2010 during a surveillance operation on the Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The little trader was circulating in a white pick-up type truck, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle’s baggage and on the copilot’s place a small backpack where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the District’s Second Judge and the convicted is still in the Center for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debt on contributions to works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes are likely not to be completed where to record serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although so far the construction programs have progressed, they are in a risk situation, since the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state must provide the 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
“They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they didn’t give us anything, even if since July they had to give us a part of it,” he says, “and we, to not record delays, started the works and we made a lot of progress, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to request a credit to cover the 7 million that the state administration had not provided at that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, we had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the state authorities to provide these resources, he said they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything.”
The court validates "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the biggest changes that the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) debooted the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the House of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogic cutting" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree that detailed the actions to follow to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was depleted because it did not reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, due to the fact that the regulation in the field of radio and television is a law-reserved attribution to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
For the project only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by accepting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions it planned for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers decided to start the complaint formulated by the House of Deputies, without discussing the project for which the minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also consider that if he did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he reminded that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has for constitutional mandate the leadership of the state.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years and this results in a better exploitation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more chains.
Delaying the change, he said, would be delaying the benefits of digitalization that involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
“These questions require the operation of a whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, comprises a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State.”
He reminded that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they did it through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has in a form invaded the sphere of competences of the Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislative, he assures.
An analysis of the possibility of a "vot by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total protocols.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality as regards the election process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Programme of preliminary election results (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total protocols.
In this sense, the Chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that a few days ago, last 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards to the federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán has not approved neither his Political Constitution nor his Electoral Code of the State or his Electoral Justice Act, while the State Congress has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral trial to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has omitted its publication within the deadlines provided for by the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9th November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called "invalid and illegal" the voting of the state mandate for constitutional reforms, because it has no right to "sanction or contest them."
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council it will be possible to make the partial and total countings of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no voting protocol and the count in the dosage of the urne is not at the president of it; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the protocols.
Furthermore, the total count of votes received in all elections may be made when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the supposed candidate winning the respective election and the one who won the second place in the election is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition of the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates.
The total calculation of the vote can also be made if at the end of the common calculation it results that the difference between the supposed winning candidate and the second place is equal or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate came out second, the case in which the electoral packages that have been the subject of the partial calculation are excluded.
It must be mentioned that this is the situation of Morelia’s election, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total protocols.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the sierra of Zapaliname, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday at night, and Monday people will present their tribute and there will be a requiem mess.
According to his family, the last will of the Lieutenant-Colonel was that his ashes were spread in the sierra of Zapaliname.
After receiving the tribute alongside the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital Coahuila on the edge of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, the peppers of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the guard chapel of the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where the family and friends went.
At 17:30 p.m. he was honored at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former technological bachelor colleagues and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the bachelor's degree.
“He wanted to go back to Saltillo and his ashes to be spread in the sierra of Zapaliname, he always said this to his family and friends,” said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot’s sister.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared a lot of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the College of Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said he had even sick truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he travelled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, for that he knows that his uncle is dead by doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
His Last Goodbye
With honours it was said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute that was headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in the studies and in the sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he piloted crashed, next to the Secretary of State, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of the service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (burned) at 18:05 p.m. to be delivered by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's planade, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and his other parents, students and masters.
Three abandoned bodies located in Cadereyta NL property
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found killed by shots shot in different parts of the body and with the grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place 1.5 km of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed through this place noticed that in the property, whose roof has beige and coffee color the gate was widely open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with bretels.
A meter away there was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because there were no bullets in situ.
In the closure of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized crime to the other, except for a few hole holes in it and in the portal.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta municipality and who are considered to have a relationship with kidnappings, murders, “halconeo” (surveillance) and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information published, in a first fact on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of freedom.
Three buildings and a cellular were confiscated; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 6:00 p.m., military personnel made a surveillance route in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the soldiers found a long weapon, a charger and 18 patterns.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 one of his complices was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the soldiers.
They are attributed to illegal inhumations in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will form on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that put this country at the edge of the economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and threatened the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he presents a cabinet composed in his majority of technocrates, although it is not clear when the new executive will take over his position.
Monti said he was going to present the president the result of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
“The framework is now well drawn,” he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that pushed its debt costs to levels impossible to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti has to approve a hard austerity package required by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By emphasizing the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds to 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian patronal Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts will have a good outcome,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Technocrate majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and patronal groups and youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
He will finish his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a short rest at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt now have returned to critical levels among the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of €1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him the time to apply the reforms before the elections advance.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist on the fact that this should only be trained by specialists, an indicator of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources that mutual disbelief and disagreements between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is greater than the experience of the Costa Rica
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convoked participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 convoked by the two countries for today's friendly, at 15:05 pm, at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, account for a wide register of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolore only has the defendant Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was achieved on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) against Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, keep an intense activity in national league and cup championships and competitions in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we need to add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rica footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to one area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in the FIFA.
We see that the biggest record in the Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before against England (defense 0-1 in London) matched the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the brain volant of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centennials of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the Schalke front center, Raúl González, with 102.
For the 100th anniversary is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the Costa Rica side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the shooter Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The Less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only has one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not yet starting.
The historic shooter of Spain is David Villa, with 50 mosquitoes, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one recording most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
“To go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality.”
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream that has become reality to happen in this country.
It is that bassist and founder member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-year celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
This day will be presented at Stade National, starting at 19:30, next to the Los Angeles group The X and the nationalists of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose full transcription is found in The Nation on the Internet.
For its Costa Rica fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it’s a so beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to spend a few days there.
It makes us excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent fans?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we’re sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we have offered over the past 21 years have occurred in the last two weeks.
We offered a two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we’ve learned, through the people who love surfing.
By watching the tour, you’ve offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What do you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced ourselves there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What is this due to?
I think that’s partially because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that’s why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to play every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have not played for a long time, it helps us to stay concentrated and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting to people as well.
With this tour, you will celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve succeeded?
Yes and absolutely.
First of all, I think no one of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we have done it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together excites us a lot.
We love each other and we love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world to which we have always wanted to go.
Things could not go better for us.
What does it mean to you that you have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friendly with people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group arises from a city, but it’s far more strange when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we took part in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, so we are lucky to be friends with them all and it’s an honor for us to form part of that sound of Seattle that has emerged.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours keeps together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be alive and second, we are all worried about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it could not go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We assure ourselves that we don’t spend too much time on tour because it’s easy to fall into this game of large crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect music and what has brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn’t really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We’ve been a group for three years and we didn’t publish a single album before Andy’s death (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustrations for the fact that she lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very distraining.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It is he who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it’s wonderful, because it’s a music that is worth listening and groups like Mudhoney now make the best music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the result of this change?
This is interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, although these may sound a bit positive.
With the two, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and those songs,, represent that for me.
I think you can also be happy and even like that you can make dark music.

Fujimori hospitalized for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength he presents in his feet, his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, who purges a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various diseases, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasmic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and strength loss in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of punishment for humanitarian reasons, undoubtedly he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It has been operated four times of tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 pounds, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, hypertension and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people due to an army’s annihilation squadron that operated illegally during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official courtier, headed by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, and composed of various ministers and patronals, will initiate a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to extend trade between the two nations and address political topics in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the top point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propice for the exchange of information in political matters between the two nations", according to information published by the President of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French president Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax paradise, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax paradise, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of his ambassador to this European country.
Mexico has been the chairman of the G20 since November, a group of the strongest emerging and developed countries in the world, and has in force with the South American country, since January this year, a agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The government has tried in recent years to postpone the realisation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
On the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumbers move to the three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, infatigable, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the craps of the evil Bowser, but he has never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the young girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to everybody’s stores, has been designed from the beginning to well exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Nintendo’s Spanish specialized press manager Omar Álvarez during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman said that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a quick and fluid play.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not fall under optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also supposes the character's return to a mobile console, which has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a look at the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustachu plumbers must travel through mined platforms of danger to release the princess Peach.
Even if I player find novelty in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had given an order for the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the washing of $70 million.
Thus the trial ends so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge it.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeyed the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He affirmed that during his term "he didn't help" in any judicial resolution and had given course to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did presupposes an executive approach after he exhausted all the judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former mandatory of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absent for the deforestation of funds of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Ministry of Public appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove Helps 6,000 Young People in Danger
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
In addition to this, the long hundred years of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make the balance in an event celebrated in a former Fabra i Coats industrial complex to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping the poor, unemployed, drug addiction or marginalized people.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of managers of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The diverse political representation, in the full election season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Regional Government of Catalonia (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor and current municipal ecosocialist adviser Ricard Goma.
They also attended in the large hall of Fabra i Coats the current Minister of Social and Family Welfare, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director-General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas affirmed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult and current time, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in trouble.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-party, evacuated
The invaders appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of the 51st Rue Balmes lived has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-fests that desperate the neighbors, by court order and without the need for a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From this day there will be access control,” said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building — the rest were inhabited — took the electric facility and a part of the water, except painting the walls and leaving there residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass holidays, which lasted up to two days and desperate the renters.
Near the building there is a discothèque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the occupation of the building, its deal has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the discothèque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him of unfair competence, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discothèque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational room had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while, according to this, the trouble was caused not by the guests of the discoteque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants to the holidays organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The director of the discothèque explained that the trouble was so big that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months that this "forgives him" the rental.
The Urbana Guardia (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from the neighbors for this situation.
The mayor’s PP municipal group chairman, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week “the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of communal life and civism that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area.”
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were flights too.
It is in this sense that he added that “we must end impunity and be implacable against the anti-social behavior generated in property.”
The Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 p.m. the police moved to the 35th Rue Mont-ral, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people had accessed the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of the call beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens the debate on Collserola's role in Barcelona
By the middle of the 1980s, at the peak of the already-extinguished Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed Collserola’s promotional posters.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the Metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it contained a comparison, in figures, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper boundary of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia being the only one that does not orient on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is at the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with sandyers in the role of the Bear Yogi.
This was the situation until, in September, the municipality called a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all the gateway to Collserola.
There is no doubt the idea of a park.
This is something, or someone wants to put the doors to the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The contest, both in terms of its organization and in terms of the city reflection is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
This is almost a recurring topic of which two members of this former cast of elected people talk when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions that coincide with three architects of Barcelona, academic professors, who have presented themselves there.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, the paths of green houses, has not been ended.
“We need to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
This is because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "Collserola gates" contains a "legical stitch": it should not be thought of these "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as a “intellectual challenge” with “some dangers”.
Dangers that arise from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience experienced in the '80s and which had in the forum area "their cygne song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
“Limiting something means setting the next step already,” that is, its overcoming.
"We need to think about new urban instruments, planning, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) ] can cause authentic disasters."
Given more to the question, Modol considers that, by simplifying, the versant of the El Valles region of Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no."
Modol reminds that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "there should not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Furthermore, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but “doubted” whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams (“all a success,” he says) that we had to create: “We, architects, should be just an instrument.”
Bayona insines that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the basics of the competition it lacks a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-concurrences have been called - he says - in the mountain-marine sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole."
This makes, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the municipality should ensure that the band immediately higher than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, a equipment zone that makes a mild transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of temporary arrest, Casino Red's legal authority founder granted forgiveness to Monterrey's mayor's brother for the trial against him for alleged chantages
After spending 72 years in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red gives him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for chantage against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, posted a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás required him to pay an economic quota so that the mayor of Monterrey allowed the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor PANiste and on 2 September this was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Ministry Agent 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the detention center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He stayed there for the next 49 days when he was sentenced to a second arrest order after the public ministry officer had detonated the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Criminal Center of Cadereyta allegedly for having sang with a million and a half pesos the Casino Red owners; but he spent only a few hours in the middle-security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial closed in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a capture order was issued by the District’s Second Criminal Court officer, Jorge Yánez, who said that after two months of investigation there were sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás’s guilt, such as that relating to the penalty of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing it to operate.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom within the next hours.
During legal formalities, the public ministry agent attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who of the gambling house members had been the one who had granted forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
In accordance with the case 197/2011, the legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no complaint relating to the trial against him will be submitted; no compensation of damages and no punishment will be requested.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 a.m. the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The court officer, Jorge Yánez, moved to the San Nicolás de los Garza prison to inform Jonás that he had been forgiven legally and his case would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the immediate freedom order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash in which the Secretary of State, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft landed, the pilot found that the weather conditions were appropriate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the soil, the pales had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so that it meets the requirements necessary to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
“In a research it was that there were no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact was presented in a structural way.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and meets the requirements for transporting them.
The ground had a pante of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For now, the secretary has assured that a priority is to get the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Assistant Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the major presidential state helicopter was working at the speed of cruising and that happened on a moist ground ascending.
“This information supports the hypothesis of a normal cruiser operation at the time of the impact,” he says.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
The visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
The weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for landing, and as the aircraft advanced to the border zone between the DF and the state of Mexico there were layers of cloudy at low height.
Selected routes:
It is likely that, due to the conditions of cloudyness, the crew sought a lower height and more visible area toward the Cuernavaca Valley.
Localization of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of the aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side trajectory.
The dispersion model of the aircraft’s remains allows to assume that the helicopter collided with the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
There were no traces of fire or explosion.
In the place of the crash there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the groundwork we found pieces of the aircraft at an altitude of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the soil presented a slope that goes from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly disarticulated throughout his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the surrounding place, around the accident, there were no dispersed parts of the aircraft, which understood the assumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and youth, called the 'Genetics of child and teen obesity' protocol that will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the 20th Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation is invited to participate in the population having or not the right, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence to minors is carried out every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He emphasized that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After achieving the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the purpose of this and that investigation is to know the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity and to identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he said that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific nutritional questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family inheritance history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturday all participants will be applied anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (such to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López that this investigation is the result of health professionals’ concern for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
“The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic increase,” the IMSS specialist said.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others by its genetic history.
He that in average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American inheritance, a 30 percent European and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess of energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
Ila even says that the presence of dark-colored flakes (acanthosis) on the neck and front arms indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors submit it in writing to the parents, to whom each is explained the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they need to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying the most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales - meat pasta with corn flour embedded in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The UNAM asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signals that the paved were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis every rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous paved is appropriate, the cassis could be reduced or even completely eliminated.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for develops modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and consequently, the formation of cassis.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltens, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltens, which together give the paved its characteristic visco-elastique behavior.
The asphalt's visco-elastique behavior consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has a solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, he added.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible paved, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more surface layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he indicates, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating effort, this allows the forces to spread very well in the paved.
If we had a modified asphalt, they would spread better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt layer, he says, a last layer called rolling layer is placed, made of fine stone, i.e., of sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adherence in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is moist, the water is spread inside the layer it is difficult to get it out, which crushes all layers of the paved and consequently causes cassis.
In the process of formation of a cassis, he says, the first that is broken is the rolling film and only later the asphalt layer is affected, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for cassis formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the paved must always be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid frequent cassis formation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, bitumine emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow repairs to be easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What missed the candidate of Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle receives her number 14 title of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca has remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium of the winners, carrying the silver crown and the band that acknowledges her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is risen with the crown and the sceptre, the department already summarizes 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women from the Valle del Cauca who have found themselves near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Giralina Giral (2007), Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many people are asking today is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation has shown that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been selected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Beautiful Face of Vogue, titles obtained by the queen Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the jury to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? put by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
“I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it’s a form of culturalization, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
Now I read “Crime and Punishment”, it’s a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book that’s called “The Armor of Blood”.
This answer didn’t like it first because of the term “culturalize” and secondly not to explain concrete how each book quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what is going on is going on.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched is that Valle was destroyed by favourism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that being the favourite, the ovationate and the candidate who received all preliminary awards (the Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best crafty costume, and Queen Mother), "this awakened the jealousy of other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the scene."
And this was noted in his first show in a bathing suit at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the crown.
Although at both parades she had seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she had no strength and energy from the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como in casa" (As at home), of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets the most prizes during the contest does not receive the Queen's crown."
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
This is why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
“Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the Competition begins they are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned for his defects behind him and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury chose him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen preparator Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there were better ones, “but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in fact wasn’t too famous for me, left her points the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from the journal Cromos considers that the candidate's mistake was the surgical interventions she had suffered.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect.”
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition gives for the first time, after the bathing shirt parade emerged a cruel prediction that was achieved yesterday night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of rule, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass in history as one of the queens who despite her brilliant passage through Cartagena, has not obtained the crown.
This was the work of the Cali person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali dactyloscopist has passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of 'Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4 a Dactyloscopist from the CTI of Cali passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Farc's top leader: "Alfonso Cano", facing his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopists working in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of “disponibility” of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after following appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something great awaited him.
On Friday night he departed to Cauca with a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the map with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the body, he didn’t recognize it by his physical appearance, because this was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He didn’t have a barbe, he was dressed like a farmers in the area, without glasses and much weaker.
But the footprints don’t lie.
accompanied by a Gellonian wolf, a ink, a pickup and a lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the map.
His eye did not mistake him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the responsible who confirmed to the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the top leader of the FARC.
Looking for the footprint
For a dactyloscopist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, at a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate, error-free science, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, dactyloscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the people captured.
When captured, many criminals present false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall of a house, because in that place the thief had pushed his hand to get out a box full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to get a digital footprint, but in this case we were able to get the footprint of all the hands and identify the criminal who had participated in different flights," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also remove or confirm suspects in cases of murder.
Recently, a man was found dead, with bottles of drinks around him.
By means of the investigation it was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and in fact a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it puts him on the scene of crime.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that “the fingerprints of objects are extracted with chemical or physical reactors.”
When they appear, you use a takeover or a band to take them.
Subsequently, the footprints are sent to Asif, the declinquents database, or to the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that everything is not as shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that is touched does not necessarily become a footprint.
However, it can be used if the confrontation is realized.
The “indignated” challenges the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters walked in front of the Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large number of people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a neighboring park.
Participants of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, to the place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated in the morning and when they tried to occupy another Grand Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters walked in front of the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a judicial order that allows the ‘indignated’ to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we'll settle in another place and we'll continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the 'indignated' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, arrived to the courts, where judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the protesters to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the 'indignated' occupied a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, property of the parish Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested a few protesters, although Bray couldn’t confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe of the fact that he saw a few journalists to whom we had also passed handbags.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to members of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them before the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property hall - remains closed while waiting for the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which we must analyze the legality of the evacuation this morning.
Some displaced protesters brought and distributed at that time copies of this judicial order and they even delivered it to the agents who watched the place, which caused 'some small confrontations', Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits authorities to evacuate members of Occupe Wall Street or to "apply laws published after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit protesters from reaching the park with tents or other properties they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to this judicial order, the city had suspended the re-opening of space to the public and protesters, whom he, however, warned of the fact that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal counsel personally defended the evacuation carried out in the morning at the Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because of the fact that the protesters 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt others" because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
“The evacuation of this morning in the morning has been disgusting and demonstrates that in the background Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of U.S. workers,” the spokesman added, who accused the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they do not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", rescue in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program of Canadian TV.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the broad broadcast on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the "Mötley Crüe" shooter, Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary by supporting in a pet a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV’s special Christmas show also presents Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian 'might' during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan regains after earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5 percent thanks to domestic consumption and ends the drop spiral in early March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, recovering even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster of the country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government calculated the material losses to $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, GDP data between July and September served to permanently turn the page: GDP increased 1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter and 6 percent in annual rate.
The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partially explained by the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline of capital spending observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulant of the Japanese economy is not exclusively based on the Keynesian impulse that calls for to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate – or reconstruct – infrastructure, using the deficits to grow from zero.
Japan has awakened mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by the increase in costs on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen – the Nippon currency – became one of the “aside values” chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and the U.S. forecast disturbances, a privilege that weighs as a layer in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, made responsibility for their low results between July and September the share of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower the guard.
“We need to follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid assessment of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts the inflation points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are blocked.
For this declined four decimals to 100,4 points, compared to 100,8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at the level 100, n falling eight decimal to 99.13 points.
Athens regains doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to move into the labyrinth that leads to the outcome of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Greek transitional government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, said yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period established in his appointment may be short to apply them, the conservative party leader, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and repeated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, that of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the official disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras no releases doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his impulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that have to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and said clearly that he will not approve any letter of commitment to realizing the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by Papandreu’s referendum, repeated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign “a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible.”
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: “These are instruments for progress and hope”
The Queen emphasizes the "prominant" place of Spain in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place globally in the role of micro-financing."
Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the world’s second donor in terms of this cooperation instrument whose “essence” lies in the fact that it is a “instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being.”
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit of Micro-Credit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very specifically, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living with income below a dollar per day, to which the "seal of poverty" is fixed.
Spain "continue working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will extend to Thursday, "garantize the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We’ve achieved a lot of goals and we’re facing a lot of challenges.”
The Micro-Credit Summit is considered not only as a forum of debate, but also as the platform from which it is necessary to push "two basic goals".
So, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that a hundred million of these families are out of the poverty threshold in which they live now.
The impulse in the design of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world “ha followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way” by Muhammad Yunus, the Queen Sofia emphasized as a “acts of justice and due recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as a "admirable idealist in the universal cause of poverty fighting", the work of which she knew since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her loan policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained Sa Majesté, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualification of "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her intervention by encouraging the people present to participate in the debate and in search of solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical Empire”
The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said microcrédits suppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, micro-credit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded “the success” of giving “confidence” to “excluded people to whom all close the door”; and Valladolid mayor, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that “open its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity”.
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned in the program but imposed itself in autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider the government’s policy too laxist toward the Greeks today and the Italians tomorrow.
The proposal for the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Board of Directors, was approved almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they had right, after their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European finance minister, did not leave place to doubt.
The chancellor’s master idea – and the motion – stands in a slogan: the response to the crisis “is not less of Europe but more of Europe.”
Not only because Europe is peace, but because “nine million jobs directly depend on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could result in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the EU’s control over the budget policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission with universal vote “to give a face to Europe”.
This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile and CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same.
But the jewel is placed.
Similarly, the delegates rejected with an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country to the European Central Bank’s headquarters according to the weight of each economy, which obviously rebounded Germany’s weight.
Worrying about calming the climate within her party, the Chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has not even sought to win her congress on the back of the “small” European countries or countries in difficulty quickly to criticize the arrogance Germany.
If the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except in the hole.
Remember that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud to illness stops?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on the disease stops.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family allocation box, and to speak a speech on the topic - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a will to make savings in a context of rigour, but is not less advertising of an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First in a budget savings goal: the government is considering to impose on private employees a fourth day of deficit before taking care of a stop of work.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a worker who gets sick would lose four days of salary, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that is likely to cause anger, but which would allow to return €280 million, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: impose on officials a day of unpaid deficiency in case of work stop (they have not until now a deadline of deficiency, against three days in the private).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also renews the topic of fraud, targeting this time abuses related to employment arrests.
“The checks will be much greater and, in addition, if you’re taken, you’ll pay back,” Xavier Bertrand warned at the RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
Like in other cases, advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to work stops.
This has since 2002 been the subject of constant monitoring and political offenses, which have most often brought their fruits.
The people are not more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economy, daily compensations accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity holidays and work accidents, and 54% concerned illness stops, or 6.2 billion euros.
2.5 per cent of the health expenditure.
In 2010, the French people experienced an average of 14.5 days of work stop, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they did not have taken any day of disease stop.
Another study, this time of the Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of disease stops were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to a month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbors, French employees are not more inclined to work stops than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at disease stops represents very little compared to black work.
As for fraud, it reaches only a small scale.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 makes the controls are systematic on disease stops for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", which is 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests over 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of cases "inappropriate or unjustified" were counted on 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, therefore, 169,000 cases "unjustified", of several million employees having had a disease stop.
A figure that represents a very little face, for example, to the work in the black.
According to UMP Deputy Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of lack of tax earnings per year, which is more than the total cost of daily compensation, and thus infinitely more than the fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment program to repair its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said on Monday 14 November before Parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his government of union would not be enough to fulfill this task.
"To continue the efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," the head of government said, who spoke his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of trust in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the eurozone "is on the game," he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “approximately 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right Party refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, brought on Monday his support for the measures already approved to try out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
“We will not vote for new measures,” he said at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and of fighting waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of 8 billion euros needed without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his speech was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, and that beyond cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take measures for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts related to various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code in such a way that assisted suicide and euthanasia may be allowed, where such a choice is necessary, with a patient judged competent to make such a decision.
The experts quote a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death.”
Medication or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, reports experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
In the country, it is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said not to want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
But, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on uncompetent or unconsented persons.
On the contrary, the report’s co-signator, Jocelyn Downie, said in a teleconference, there would be more cases of these overwhelms in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already expressed their favour to euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of life to relieve their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents estimate that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes toining or ceasing treatment with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained on the duty of respecting a life-long refusal of care, without fear of criminal proceedings.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, and that beyond cases of cancer.
Finally, as regards palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reserve of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Me Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, quoted as “extreme” the position of the experts signing the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the terminal phase.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide,” said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report.
Me Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seem to place the person’s autonomy above all other values that participate in the social tissue of society.
“In society, he says, there are signs and constraints.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular contests the data in the report regarding the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a “conflict”
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Bashar al-Assad’s supporters demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure has intensified yesterday on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a "compound" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have taken a position in favour of a resignation of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave the power" in Syria where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime forces were still killed.
"If Bachar had the heart of his country's interests, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have resulted in a failure.
“Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and can’t satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey adopts an increasingly harder line.
The U.S. on its side congratulated a “fortified consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harder tone" in the face of the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have died in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced.
Two other civilians were killed "in the course of heavy gunshots and gunshots in Jobar" in the occupied city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said that the country was “directed towards the end of the crisis.”
He also strongly reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he says is "a dangerous step."
“Syria will not flee,” he added, assured that “ourged conspirates against Syria will fail.”
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said is locked in the “paranoia.”
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis-output plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from cities plagued by the protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the decision of the Arab League was "inappropriate" while China urged Syria to implement the outcome plan, whileining support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future Italian government leader, Mario Monti, demanded some time to the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "offers", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today with the trade unions and the employer.
It should set up a relatively limited cabinet composed of technocrates outside the Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the talks, after meeting the appointed Council president.
Parliament’s chairman, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to request a trust vote in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list, a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for preparing a government and its program, he emphasized, saying "certain that the markets will be patient and will understand."
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns regained the top especially after an unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should form a team comprising mainly technocrates, although he emphasized that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, date of the next legislative elections, he said.
The President of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, said the new government will gain Parliament’s confidence by Friday.
Mr. Monti has committed, once he entered office, to work in the urgency and in the goal that Italy "receives the protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not its budget balance goal in 2013 despite the savings plans adopted in recent months, has in particular called for new strict measures.
Italian patron Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "changing of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of the serious" and a "other Italy", according to the publishers.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would want to avoid early elections, as Italy must put 200 billion euros of state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said Monday a U.S. NGO specializing in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Atomic Safety (IEA) and other documents issued by this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA said last week its "serious concerns" regarding a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS widespread in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Cheliabinsk (Oural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company that produces “nano-diamonds” in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then cooperate with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA quotes “strong indications that the development by Iran” of a nuclear detonation system “was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a member state informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his country of origin.”
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence fell slightly or slowly, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims has risen from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47,3% are motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” the human rights organization Human rights First said, “the increase in anti-muslim violence is significant,” the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” added one of the organization’s officials, Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to fight these abuses,” he added, believing that this could go through an improved police report on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in American federal law is an inheritance of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced on Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in order to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, making its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to follow more readily, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the internet users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know whether they follow messages, whether they subscribe to new accounts, whether they have favourite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinct functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to re-send a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opens to a broader audience with a more comparable maneuver to that of the broad public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users debated at a hit of “tweets” on the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream,” said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Inscription of a "Golden Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great social-democratic/Christian coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to insert in the constitution a "golden rule" budgetary in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign rating of Austria (triple A).
It is the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, much above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced by only one cran, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of additional interest each year,” said Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria so follows a request from the Eurozone summit in Brussels last October 26: the heads of states and governments had then demanded the inscription by the end of 2012 of the public deficit reduction and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The mechanism adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a “rule”.
By 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of GDP and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to move the public debt to the horizon 2020/21 under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yin strong
Noda threatens new intervention on the exchange market
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene on the exchange market if the yen should continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did the last time if we see an excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historic levels that pushed the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yens against dollars in order to lower the value of the Nippon currency that was just setting a new record of validity since 1945 against the green currency.
But the yen has been regularly rising since then, doped by investors’ purchases that consider it a “aside value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar dropped below the 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro dropped below the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flame of the Nippon currency damages the exports of the archipelago as it raises the cost of the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the incomes from abroad by Japanese companies, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan struggles to reconstruct itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east), Noda stressed who fears that this rushing of the yen will not kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third-largest global economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter -1,5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound of the exports and consumption of the disastrous households.
But the prime minister ruled that the cost of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “the appropriate measures”, leaving it to hear that no additional monetary relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuance institute increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5 billion yen (47 billion euros) to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of the amounts it devotes to the purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
The Eurozone:
Rates rise, stock exchanges rise
The risk of infection from the debt crisis still mines European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
Always concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchange falls a little more into negative territory, this Tuesday, November 15.
At 10 p.m. in Paris, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax transferred 0.4% to Frankfurt and 0.1% to London.
“With the new tensions on the debt returns of the eurozone states in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of infection,” says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, cited by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed in a 0.7 percent decline, suffering by the renewed fears of market stakeholders about Europe’s ability to counter the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes turned to Europe and trade will continue in a narrow variation corridor as long as investors don't have evidence that the situation is stable," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This regain of concerns about the future of the euro zone punishes the single currency, which continues its fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At 10 p.m., the European currency is worth $1,3570, with a drop of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has recalled after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without yet leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates exceeding 6%
Lending rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, the yield of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of the speakers.
The future Italian government leader Mario Monti has called for time to the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the market line, while the legislative elections are held on Sunday.
The rate gap ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new high history.
Eurozone growth figures
According to statistics, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a bit better than the 0.3% expected, carried out by household consumption.
Insee, however, revised down the figure in the second quarter, with a 0.1% decline in GDP instead of a stagnation.
This is the fourth thing that worries most the economists.
Germany, on its part, recorded a 0.5% growth in the same period.
A first estimate for the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
The Energy Policy:
Facts have to overcome dogmas.
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the impact of emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear power holds there.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores the entire economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must build their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic evolution will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, we will need to eliminate the weakness of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate disorder, a subject missing from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
It is not the case of Belgium, which submits its to the need to be able to find a substituting source, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only last-generation power plants.
On the contrary, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to mention only them, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by rebuilding a power plant that was interrupted after the Three Mile Island crash.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality opposes the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the rise in the price of electricity, an energy dependence worsened by the increased use of imported gas, from Russia, a CO2 emissions jump resulting from the construction of gas and coal power plants.
Within a few months, all of these horrible effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be considered.
He is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind intermittence; according to which, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constantness of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee ofining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant decrease in the share of nuclear power would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of the French refuse to pay, especially as they do not manifest a principle of opposition to this energy, the surveys show that.
Let’s remember that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it brings a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very creative of unmovable jobs.
If France just decided to get out of the nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros annually of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electricist would order an EPR designed to operate for seventy years when the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of miracle electricity production, no more than that there is no demonic.
Areva’s development of low-CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power,ining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a security authority that exercises intransigant and transparent control over existing power plants as well as on the construction site in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited with the same security obsession.
In a half-century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take the lessons from this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
Fruit of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it able to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricists willing to build a power plant, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to take leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogms and supportive maneuveres dominate a debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles – the engraving of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the number, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of “land of human rights” of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Libération du 23 mai) proclaiming in the passage that France "not needs foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't welcome all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared to both left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference depends on the degree of generosity that will be granted to immigrants.
In his program, Francois Hollande cants to banalities, indicating that co-development will allow us to solve our “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is electorally paid; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind in a recent book that summarizes the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restriction of immigration is anemic to growth and harm employment.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are at risk of replacing themselves with national workers, especially the unqualified, exercising a lower pressure on their wages.
But the experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitute to national employees, exercising for the most of the professions in sectors in shortage of employment.
Low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow the job offer.
Positive Effects on Wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country that has a shortage of anesthesiists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, at an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (low expenditure revenue) of €150,000 to the public budgets in average for his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to go to search for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The tooth in question, serving to dissuade immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about democracy.
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, the totalitarism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some might have believed that it would be enough, so that democracy would definitively triumph its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
It is known, since Napoleon the “Little”, that it was a light of thought.
The universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become a “instrument of oppression” as the former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also, and first of all, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodism of the true false Greek referendum has had in this regard a double revealing value: that of the need for a powerful return from politics, but also of the troubling feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that today the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved, and that, for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer pulling in the right direction.
We have nothing to win by demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to the need and in dispersed order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a foot jump joined in the emptiness of nationalist rejection: what choice for the citizen!
No, we don’t want couperets but a common, full-right, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal – we would no longer know where to stop the list – because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole Europe that plays to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are worried about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe – but it is the whole Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent thing is to return to the popular sovereignty the pilot of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debt, get free from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will imply decisions at European level that cannot be made without a complete democratic legitimacy, except that of course will lead us to a disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everybody today demands the European economic government.
to be.
But thinking that without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to make the Republicans.
The revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe on a political scale, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
The “no-contact” chip cards are generalized
The world chip map exhibition opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, phone with SIM cards...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most portable segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching a player’s card.
This year, 460 million uncontact chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
For a long time behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe gains ground for contactless payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the starts are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the doubles.
This year, Carrefour has issued 2.5 million uncontact MasterCard Pass cards.
To move to greater speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French establishments have committed to systematically broadcasting to their customers uncontact bank cards in the future," said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payments
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to perform transactions.
“They have taken a delay.”
"But they should finally see a real growth next year."
“We’re planning to sell 80 to 120 million units in the world in 2012,” says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a stick that allows uncontact payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Company, too, said yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda and Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspects have long confirmed the links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algeria has now “acquired the certainty.”
“The way the two organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that there is good cooperation,” he explained without further precision.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation on the kidnapping of two French citizens in Niger last January had opened the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by neighbors of Akmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were supposed to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the ruins of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the passed calls is directed to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), two numbers are interested in the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram and the other to a man who says he is close to Akmi and the sect.
“This is a progress, but we must wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
“But it is possible.”
“It has been known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these “supports” have been increasingly obvious in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of more and more complex kamikaze or explosive engines and the same account as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, then made pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of uninterested illuminated people.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Muhammad Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in haussa means "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is rapidly successful.
It politizes itself and demands strict respect for the sharia while its activists engage in the struggle against the impaired central government.
These are mainly addressed to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists showed themselves active, multiplying the attacks on the police offices.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is investing in the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, detained alive, is killed in prison.
Then the sect will radicalize and leave its feeds from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, and another in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took to the police’s secure QG during a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now concerns all security specialists.
While Akmi has invested in Mali and Niger, which the Somalians of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information" .
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplism and ignorance.
Can a America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied tonicing statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans – often not supported – went.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the "Grand Old Party" nomination race, threatened to pull the Chinese ahead of the WTO and question them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme carrying in a America exhausted by the migration of whole panels from its industry to Asia.
So much if this should involve the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to China of Obama and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has almost strangled in the face of an attitude that “flates” the emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains unheard.
The image of Reagan
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I’m elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations toward this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of the records.
Recently, he called on to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing “proves to develop a nuclear capacity” – apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants attacks on Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president react that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in anti-terrorism matters.
They righteously insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too precipitated departure of the “boys” of Iraq, on his deprivations in Libya, thus hunting him a label of weakness.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers rather positive Obama’s national security balance sheet, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it is suspicious of military interventions that lead to the disappearance.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically reconstructed to resurrect its leadership, Obama hits more just.
North Stream, the new gateway of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It has to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brightness.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part on Tuesday, on the borders of the Baltic, between orchestra and final buffet, in the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his homologue from the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe through a first tube of 1.224 km connecting the region of St. Petersburg to the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second tube will be completed by the end of 2012, allowing to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same path.
For Gazprom, the timely and timely completion of this enormous building has airs of victory.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will enable the supply of gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Thus, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to the Western European markets.
In the strongest of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.
The subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by bringing its support to this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe’s energy, since the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has managed to triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, strongly gas consumers, and whose deposits are in decline.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically,” Fillon confirmed by inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical outcome.
The submarine tube is made of steel gained from concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mining fields dating from World War II.
“A hundred people had to be kidnapped or destroyed, for caution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
There was also an increase in measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal serpent, heavily as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts over all its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden, but the project managers renounced it as the Swedish were unwanted to see a Russian state company establishment permanently outside their coasts.
“In the event of a disaster, we stop the passing of the gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned welding to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The surveillance of the state of the gas pipeline is provided by a submarine robot, traced by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
From the shape of a cigarette, it is introduced inside the tube, width of a meter of diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
At arrival, after three full days of journey at a speed of 3 meters a second, he provides accurate information on possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply secured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of its shares.
The German E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint company, named Nord Stream, responsible for building and operating the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is favorable.
Gazprom then rented to this company, for twenty renewable years, the entire gas transport capacity.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” said Jens Müller.
The funding for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided at 30% by shareholders and at 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the construction is expected to reach €7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment increased to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to get back in their expenses, as Gazprom alone takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted by pins.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas output door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that comes, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine is a brand book.
Founded about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine book, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the skin mole (the taup skin) that indicates a painted cotton used to cover bankets for example.
This type of book was very appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine gave the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the twentieth century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million passed coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It’s hard to set up a buyer’s portrait-robot, because the notebook attracts both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, has 100 today and has since 2008 two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city centre and has been able to impose her identity.
“We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own booklet.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Getting advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, stylos, computer houses... The brand declines on a wide range of supports.
A success that made jealous: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of people with disabilities so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for Disabled Employment begins today.
Despite a volunteer public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled persons is still twice higher than the average: 19%, against 9% for the entire population.
to disguise?
“No,” says Eric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the Week for Disabled Employment.
“The progress achieved over the past 15 years is considerable.”
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.”
“There is still a lot to do.”
It should be said that for disabled unemployed, obstacles remain many before accessing employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% in average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree and on the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for disabled people, against 38% in average.
In short, so many criteria that particularly complicate the return to employment, and that “represent the node of the problem,” according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help recruit disabled workers.
This is for the objective brakes.
It remains the unknown, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise for the City association indicated that the managers surveyed had “a low level of knowledge of disability,” with a “overrepresentation of people on a wheelchair, mental or intellectual disabled.”
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of 1987.
The latest known figures, which date from 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of the Afegiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of “taxed” establishments, as well as the amount paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on, explains Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also translates a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of the establishments of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: “What Happiness”
Before confronting the Blue on Tuesday evening (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match brought to them.
We will not even write that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stadium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after his attacker’s mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian selector has only praises to do about him.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian.”
“I want to go ahead,” Lillois assures on his side.
As for the contrast between his club and selection benefits, "it's a whole, it's justified."
“I’m there all year, which is not the case with Belgium.”
“I have to take my signs.”
Menaaged against Romania on Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brill".
Not to mention the notion of “pleasure”.
The Blue, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been patient,” he says.
This must contribute to further strengthening the “specific” character of this meeting.
Especially in front, “there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),” he rape.
“We met right now.”
“To be able to play against them is just happiness.”
With Bonhomie, Leekens, on his part, talked about “frightness.”
“I’m happy to play a game of gala.”
“I’m so proud to see – as a “ neighbor” – that France is “returned a very high-level team” a little more than a year after Knysna’s trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a work of the tuner,” he was enthusiastic.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would see it well to share the aircraft with the Blue direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our small Belgians are becoming big,” he emphasized.
“We’re building something, players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
“You’ll be aware of it in the next matches.” the one against France included.
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal’s Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimism his back barrage against Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The two teams missed realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, whose hands he has been since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there’s a match to play, and a opponent, Bosnia, to break down.
Given the match going (0-0), Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score this valuable goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk because we haven't set a goal outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade of the Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a audience that should be so hot there, even if the game is obviously “very tight,” says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We are expecting a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we can take the top,” the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We're still having a 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor has relativized.
The null reported on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
One zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It's a good result, which, however, involves a certain risk because we haven't set a goal outside," Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put a maximum pressure on the Bosnians so that they “do not give them time to think.”
It’s a good idea, but this time it’s realistic.
