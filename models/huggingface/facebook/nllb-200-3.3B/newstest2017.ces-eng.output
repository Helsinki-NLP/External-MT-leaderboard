A 28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco convenience store.
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was this week on the steps of a local grocery store.
But the victim's brother says that he has no idea who would want to hurt him, adding: "He's finally getting on".
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department has said that this is a violent death and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was previously a line chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close-knit family and we will miss him very much", said the spokesman.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and condolences go out to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had initially been sleeping in the dorms, but that he had recently finally started to get by.
"He found a flat, he was dating a girl", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to be with the family, he always cooked us dinner, made us dinner, " Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to get into any fights.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was a diamond in the rough that shone every day", he said.

Czech Railways invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernisation.
They got air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state-owned carrier has invested over 31 billion crowns in vehicle upgrades.
One third of the trains are now air-conditioned, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in each year except 2012 decrease gradually.
Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion crowns in vehicle modernisation over the last six years.
One third of the trains are now air-conditioned, and about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money invested has resulted in a reduction in the average age of locomotives and single units by two years and of classic wagons by six years.
The majority of the investments were made by the carrier in regional transport, where about 60% of the money was invested, while 40% of the company invested in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of the locomotive and unit is currently 19 years.
However, upgraded older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not taken into account, the average age of the Chernobyl engines would increase by 10 years.
The average age of the passenger cars is slightly older, with an average age of 23 years when modernisation is taken into account.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
However, in recent years, the classic sets consisting of wagons and drawn by locomotive have been gradually disappearing from the Czech and worldwide railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives decreased from 280 to 223, and the number of classic cars also decreased from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was disposing of old vehicles with leather seats and doors that could not be locked while driving.
Between January and July, he had the hauliers scrap 110 of these wagons.
The investments in the fleet that ČD plans to make in the near future include, for example, the purchase of 50 railcars for speeds up to 200 km/h that the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or the framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic high-speed lines.
The contract provides for the purchase of up to 30 units of motor and 20 units of electric units.
Authorities have known about the illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, and they can't get rid of it.
We are completely helpless, they admit.
For the fourth year running, the online newspaper Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only is it a tourist attraction to take a stroll in the crowns of trees, but also the Olympic Park.
The highway patrol knows it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of these ads all over the country.
Officials say the law is flawed, making it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards right away.
What is needed is a complicated bureaucratic wheel.
But in the meantime, the company's gonna change its name and the office is gonna be short on it.
Or just move the ad a few feet and the official process has to start over.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno, there is a black billboard on our property next to the state road.
But three months was not enough for the officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
As if no one cares that he's standing right next to the road in a 50-mile security zone where nothing can happen for safety.
Road managers say the billboard is too big for them to handle easily because of the hole bill.
Maybe load him up and drive him away.
"We can't just afford it", says Nina Ledvin, spokeswoman for the Roads and Highways Department, referring to the complex bureaucratic process that the billboard removal must legally prevent.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate the online diary Aktuálně.cz began to follow in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve efficiently and quickly.
In southern Czechia alone, the editorial counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules right next to or near the road.
Other counties are similar.
"We have difficulty getting companies to remove the signs", confirms Jiří Klása, head of the transport department of the Český Bělojí County Office, whose colleagues are tackling similar stories.
According to Klasa, the law is flawed, and the officials are bound.
First, they must reluctantly approach the owner of the billboard to have the advertisement removed.
But the bosses are often unreachable or they know a trick that Aktuálně.cz has described in the past when the issue was investigated in more detail: just move the mobile advertising stand a few meters and the officials can throw the previous call to remove the black ad into the trash.
That's because the Bureau has to pinpoint exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly don't match, it is seen as a new device and we have to contact the owner again", explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could be brought about by a new law that will ban billboards on highways starting next September and restrict them to first class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for fighting illegal and easily portable advertising will remain the same as before.
And the authorities will not be so easy to deal with.
Companies can still make tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year renting illegal space, and no one can touch them.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
The officials know her well: the Českobudějovice Magistrate is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with her for black-built billboards.
The firm faces a fine of $3,000 in each case.
These are multiple advertisements that were placed in a Class I protection zone without permission.
The drive is not yet over, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the Českobudějovskiy magistrate.
The ad that Aktuálně.cz is interested in is not yet among these cases, but it will most likely be soon.
According to the spokeswoman for the DEA, Nina Ledvin, the firm has not responded to repeated written requests for removal, and the case will now be on the county and possibly the magistrate's desk.
Commerz Billboard is one of those shady companies that we can't reach.
It does not accept mail and it has abolished its registered office in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail went to Anton Fischer, a South Bohemian businessman who had a bitter dispute with the head of the Czech representative of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases the space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has denied any connection in the past.
In the spring of this year, when the RSF began to take an interest in Lipno advertising, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the mysterious Commerz Billboard company to his guest house, where the company is supposedly based.
But no one has called the highway authority from this address.
It was a struggle.
Such silence or opaque changes of residence are not uncommon.
We fined a company a couple of years ago, in stages, for two million crowns.
But she changed the name and the I.C.O. And there was nothing to work out.
The bailiff dropped the case, the ads kept going, maybe to other places.
We're pretty much powerless against these companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admits one of the officials on condition of anonymity.
The amendment of the law in this respect is not yet being discussed.
Currently.cz spoke to several members who were interested in the problem.
But they haven't shown any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government denied it.
Billboards are a sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic subject for not only national but also state and local politicians.
On the one hand, they know the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they need them for their own advertising campaigns.
I don't subscribe to the rather established impression that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the law.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more beets and poppy seeds, statistics estimate.
The Czech Statistical Office estimates that the grain harvest this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year's harvest exceeds the average of the last five and ten years.
On the other hand, the yield of beets (3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The grain harvest this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain each year.
This follows from the estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of 15 July.
The original estimate a month ago was more pessimistic, predicting a decennial decline from last year.
But last year's grain harvest was above average.
This year's crop is above the average of the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of beets and poppies will be higher this year.
The beet growers are harvesting 3.9 percent more than they did a year ago, when they received 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decline in cereal production is due to both a 3.7 percent drop in yield per hectare to 5.71 tons per hectare and a decline in the area sown.
Farmers have reduced their fields by three percent this year.
The Czech Republic's most important cereal, winter wheat, is expected to decline by 3.3 percent this year.
Farmers spread it out over multiple fields.
However, the decline is accompanied by a decrease in the yield per hectare, which falls to 6.04 tonnes.
A roughly five-fold decline is expected for spring barley, the most commonly used for beer production.
The decline in crop yield is due to a 15.2 percent decrease in arable land, as well as a lower yield per hectare.
Winter barley, on the other hand, produces 6.3 percent more.
The grain harvest will also increase.
The statistics estimate the rapeseed crop at 1,305 million tons, an increase compared to last year.
The area planted with seed increased by 7.3 percent.
But the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's beet harvest exceeds the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, with plantings a third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, poppy fields have also been growing.
Last year, farmers planted it on 85,000 acres.
But by 2008, when poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, it was half the size of the field.
The expansion of the planted area will make this year's mackerel harvest richer.
It's up 2.5 percent from last year to 27,423 tons.
But the yield per acre will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers charged two men with assault with knife and machete, the court sent them to prison.
Police have charged two assailants who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete in downtown Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, he was given cutting and stabbing wounds that required hospital treatment and further treatment", police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both of the obvious perpetrators were apprehended by police officers immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a motion to have them remanded in custody, and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have charged two suspects with assaulting a 35-year-old man in downtown Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers inflicted cutting and laceration wounds, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that occurred at noon on Tuesday on Svoboda Street, police said.
The perpetrators were arrested, according to the police spokesman, Marie Štrbáková.
A large-scale brawl between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar, in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal exchange, two assailants attacked the 35-year-old man with knives and machetes.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was left with sharp and cutting wounds that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokesman said.
The fight, which has attracted a lot of attention in the city center and has forced several police patrols and guards to intervene on the spot, was a family dispute.
Criminal investigators have charged a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted aggravated assault and rioting.
The plaintiff filed a motion for the court to take them into custody and the court granted him on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was used in a mass fight in the center of Olomouc by attackers five years ago, it happened just a few dozen meters away, in front of the Varna disco in Riegrova street.
Police said at the time that a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked the guests of the business who were standing in front of the entrance.
Police say they were armed with knives, sticks and machetes.
The court then sentenced the two foreigners to suspended prison terms.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, you may pass them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the vast building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážná Square.
It should have been a hotel by now.
But still nothing.
That there's a need to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
In the very centre of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several apartment buildings which, despite their location, size and often even heritage protection, are empty and full of emptiness.
We selected the properties in the centre using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term vacant properties in the Czech Republic.
Homes are usually the victims of their owners' financial problems, opaque business relationships, or belong to the state, which doesn't know how to get rid of them or doesn't want to.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax on them, the initiative wants
Fidel Castro was almost shot here. Hitler's brother lived here.
The writers showed another Small Party.
The shopping apocalypse.
The malls in the U.S. are empty.
To the Prague Unknown.
Karlin was a luxury suburb.
The layout is reminiscent of Manhattan, the architect says.
The Clintons made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
They gave over a million dollars to Clinton charities.
Most of the Clintons' income - over six million dollars - is from their speeches.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, raising pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, according to the Associated Press.
The majority of the Clintons' income - over six million dollars - is from their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign for the election.
Tax records show the Clintons paid federal income tax last year at 34.2 percent and state and local income tax at nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, and he has not yet decided to release his tax returns.
There's a very real possibility that Donald Trump pays no taxes at all, Clinton tweeted minutes after publishing her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy over Trump's earnings, in part to cast doubt on whether her rival is as wealthy as he claims, the AP reported.
Trump's wealth is estimated to be in the billions of dollars.
A lower salary would damage the Republican candidate's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former first lady, today released a report on his tax returns over the past ten years.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and withheld 25.6 percent of their income from taxes last year.
In Nigeria, polio has again broken out.
Boko Haram Islamists prevented vaccination and killed doctors.
There has been a resurgence of polio cases in Nigeria.
In the northeast, the government has declared an emergency vaccination campaign, as two children infected with the disease have been paralyzed.
The vaccines were delivered by helicopter.
In the affected area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were preventing vaccinations and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization, the virus was circulating there undetected.
In northeastern Nigeria, an emergency polio vaccination campaign is being launched after two children infected with the disease became paralyzed.
The last time polio was diagnosed in Africa was two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that one million children in Borno State and four million in neighboring states will be vaccinated.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday rushed polio vaccines to the stricken northeast of the country, where Islamist terrorists Boko Haram operate, according to the Associated Press.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating unnoticed in the area for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have in the past prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from reaching areas where children with polio were found on Thursday.
Both of the affected toddlers came from refugees from the newly liberated part of Nigeria from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO's polio eradication unit, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria will begin as early as next week.
Borno State has long been home to the Islamist militant group Boko Haram.
The area was open to international organizations and the government until early this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in this part of the country.
Nigeria's health minister, Isaac Adewole, admitted that new polio cases were a big disappointment for the country, as Nigeria was going to declare polio eradicated next year.
The WHO warned that it was possible that the disease had not appeared for two years, but had spread among children.
Children up to five years of age will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it now exists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He was sick of the touching stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who had escaped from a pimp gang thanks to the police.
The pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
The meeting was intended to draw attention to the problem of trafficking in human beings and to call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope Francis met in Rome with 20 former prostitutes who were freed by the police from the clutches of a pimp gang.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the emotional stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes whom Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one each from Tunisia, Italy, and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to brutal physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
The Pope's spokesman said that Francis' visit was to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against it.
Francis often points out the fate of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican in April and June this year at his personal invitation.
France will strike at the jihadist factories.
But without the help of the Muslims, it's not going to work.
France has to be helped by Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islam.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing to make fundamental changes in the functioning of mosques and the training of clergy.
We've closed 20 mosques and prayer houses since December of last year.
And others will follow, the Home Secretary has announced.
There are over 100 jihadist factories operating in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this freedom of religion", declared Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it will ensure that only imams who have been educated in France preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop foreign funding for mosques.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money for new mosques comes from abroad, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
And because of that, the preachers who can spread radicalism in France get into the mosque.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy", the prime minister added.
The key to ensuring that these objectives are met will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country now has the French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
The foundation was already intended to help to make the financial flows between mosques and the countries that funded their construction more transparent.
But the institution was soon beset by internal dissension and rivalry.
"It's a total failure", Valls recently noted.
The debate on the new institution that will replace the defunct foundation has been heated on the French political scene since the attack on the magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015.
All of this has been precipitated by the recent terrorist attacks in France, carried out by radicalized Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently announced that a new foundation will be created this October.
He will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
It's not clear where he's going to get the money to build not only new mosques but also various educational centers.
But there are a few suggestions that are being considered.
One of them is the special charge or tax on halal food.
This is what Halal food vendors would pay in practice for providing certification.
Some of that money would then go directly to the foundation's cash register.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros (£1 to £15) could then be paid by French pilgrims going to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them travel to Saudi Arabia for the traditional pilgrimage.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, in future, only preachers who have passed special training programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that the preaching is in harmony with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
The French government is simultaneously campaigning against the radicals.
And others will follow, the Home Secretary recently announced.
France has no place for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
It is estimated that there are some 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 imams, and are considering deporting dozens more.
But not everyone thinks that the government's actions can significantly counter radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalized will do the same.
It's not happening in mosques, young people are becoming radicalized on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
The track rider Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint to the star Baugém.
To advance to the quarterfinals, the Czech track cyclist must fight in the repair runs.
After advancing from the sprint qualifying in the top eighteen, road cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro lost in the first round of the fight against French great Gregory Baugé, the silver medalist from the previous Games in London.
They'll have to fight for the last eight in the road race.
27 riders took the start of the royal race on the track and the best Czech racer of the day set the fourteenth best time.
He made the double-header with a jump start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was expected to be the fifth Bauge in qualifying, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Although Kelemen was finishing off the experienced Frenchman, he was careful.
A great performance by the gold defender Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Briton set the third-fastest 200 in history and won the qualifying in an Olympic record time of 9.551.
He then, as expected, consulted the last of the advancing Germans, Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet, with Bradley Wiggins, won the 4km sprint, setting a new world record of 3:50.570, and advanced to the final.
The previous record of 3:51,659, four years after the London Olympics, was improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Push: They Want Fresh Air in the Field
The young doctors' representatives have gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Young Doctors Council (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) has to ask the whole council to support further specialist events from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have been unable to resolve the issues surrounding the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the contract with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who took part in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter late Thursday, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government remained silent on the issues, leading to the contract's rejection.
She said: In this light, the JDC Executive Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and to request a new formal negotiation on all issues.
In response to the government's silence today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve the current program of the upcoming trade shows in early September.
The dispute has led to the young doctors calling six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA's young doctors, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members in meetings before the vote in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister for Health said that the contract would be a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of the 'incompatible'?
It was a gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of eight months of war of words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the luxurious lobby of the St. Petersburg palace, I got the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Putin was not smiling and barely radiated warmth, even by his own standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has spoken repeatedly about his "dear friend" Mr. Putin - five times, according to one report.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the exact opposite.
But the lingering coldness that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin was giving away wounds around him and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The scandal was made all the greater by the fact that it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media has been waging a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks were to blame for everything.
More serious were the accusations from top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, an official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only came about because Putin got the apology he wanted from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was nearly removed from power in a failed coup last month, and he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There's also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a harsh impact - most notably the cancellation of charter flights that bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
That number has dropped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely take a break here if flights are resumed.
They make money off of Mediterranean tourism in the off-season.
Even this week, state TV promised cheaper fruits and vegetables once imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here", as reported in the newspaper Vedemosti.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West over what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-running hostility of the protracted EU accession talks and the entry of Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly gained bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from elected bodies after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, this is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, maritime palace of Russia and Turkey has allowed us to demonstrate what one analyst described to me as "an alliance of incompatibilities": how two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West join forces.
But despite publicly demonstrating their reconciliation, the two countries have fundamental differences.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has recently taken a peacekeeping role, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of opening conversations, the two presidents said in a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement on which the two countries can find common ground on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it's certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand is to be relegated to the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
It was a relief when it went bankrupt eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At the time, strategic brands used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent on sponsorship of international sport, from the Six Nations rugby championship to the Wimbledon champion Andy Marraye.
But now it was decided that it was better to give more prominence to the national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not open new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, except for the head office and stock exchange coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that are getting more prominent - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our visits to customers and staff in Inverness-shire, we had Ross McEwan answering questions.
He told BBC Scotland: 'The RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand our employees work for, because we are now becoming much more of a brand bank.'
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand, and so was RBS.
Now I say we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under those brands.
RBS has already indicated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, and has prepared a profile of individual brands sponsoring the sport.
'The time has come for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (we are asking) is how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers?' said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we were going to be a great bank for customers and they introduced these brands.
But along with the fact that we've been focusing on the needs of the customers, rather than our own, I think a lot of changes are happening.
We can recall these marks, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket on the Predilection has taken 3,000 winners to the finish line.
Dettori splashing champagne after his double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory at the British Open at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory of the evening at his local track - on the horse Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve that in flat racing.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson. He was the first British Prime Minister to be elected as a member of the House of Commons.
Three-time champion chequer Dettori, who had previously won on Ghayyar's horse, said: "It's strange".
I'm very touched because my family is here too
I'm very glad that it happened in Newmarket, because that's where I was anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations as Predilection brings in the winner
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in the obstacle course - the champion of the jockeys Richard Johnson and the 20-time champion retired Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his record breaking career led more than 4,300 winners to the finish line.
Lester Piggott, nine-time winner of the Derby, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of the modern era, and it's no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical fixture that sets him apart from the other riders in the weight room.
He's a fantastic ambassador for the sport, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he hadn't just raced on weekends and big races, he'd have 6,000 winners by now!
But the truth is that Frankie has been riding the winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a lively temperament, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous high-flying downhill
From flying finishes to flying jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the British flat racing messenger for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
He won a number of major races, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from the start for doping.
Three years ago, he first stumbled when he returned from a six-month suspension, but he showed incredible inner strength and, against all odds, returned in top form.
And it may not be the last - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue racing until he is at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential office Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as the head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
63-year-old Ivanov has been appointed special representative for environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin had dismissed Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential office, but did not give a reason.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
44-year-old Vajno was a former diplomat.
Born in Estonia's capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
He was later appointed as the Head of Presidential Protocol and Presidential Office.
When he was appointed, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust".
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and controlling the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his resignation and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Will the smiles convince?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on state television, both men said they were resigning as heads of the presidential office at their own request.
But smiles for the cameras have convinced few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man once considered a possible president is now eager to lead Russia's environmental policy has been met with great distrust.
On the Kremlin's website, quoted remarks addressed to Putin, Ivanov states: "It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding, one could even say problematic post for four years.
Apparently, I've been the president's chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and, like Putin, formerly worked for the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest aides.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov could succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, as a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken by another close associate of Putin Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of Criminal Minds, was released after he punched the director
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on stage in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, the networks that produce the show, released a joint statement announcing his firing.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his firing was announced.
There were creative differences on the stage and there were disagreements.
"I'm sorry that this has happened", he said in a statement.
According to statements from ABC and CBS, details of how Gibson's character will disappear from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, are forthcoming.
The 54-year-old, who rose to fame with her starring role in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since the first series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that's not going to be possible now.
I'd also like to express my gratitude to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing team and most of all, the amazing fans this show has ever hoped for.
The show is expected to return for its 12th season on September 28.
In the town of Banff, fish mysteriously landed in a fish garden.
A man from the town of Banff has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 of the fish may be sand eels left behind by the water bush.
Bain, who lives about a half mile from the sea, posted a short video of his find on the Periscope channel, hoping that someone could help him explain how the two-inch-long fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now links to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the northern platform to the Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects to Fife.
This is the first of four interlocking sections between the three platforms that are now almost complete around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the Fife Bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspended cables.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to arrive from the mainland at the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment for the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnessing how the construction engineers used over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge on an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, completing the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck was a delicate operation requiring extraordinary precision.
With over 79% of the total bridge area now in place, the concrete for the final section of the platform is now being poured into Rosythu, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: 'The first lock on any bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this lock represents the pinnacle of earthwork.
After installing the final section of the roadway and connecting it to the North Tower's expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by extending the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters to the south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons, and had to be towed at an incline of about 3 percent.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Everything went very well, thankfully.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are lucky to be alive
Three men are lucky to be alive after being washed up on their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre lifeboat station of the RNLI issued a distress call Friday at 1:20pm British Summer Time after the crew saw an incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued unchecked.
"We saw their boat circling nearby and thought the worst", said lifeboat helmsman Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Luckily, a strong wind blew it away from them before we could get out", he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, the third man in his 60s was found without a life jacket exhausted as he held on to the buoy.
All were transferred to the shore lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: 'Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a cordon for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the capsizing occurred.
Someone above these boys had a protective hand.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of the Ripper's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who were allegedly to get political trafficking from Prime Minister Nečas and his then-cabinet chief Janna Nagy, a lucrative post for political concessions.
In 2012, it was about approving a tax package.
Schneider, Fuchs and Tluchohr made it possible by their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
That's why they also faced bribery charges and ended up in jail for a month.
According to the court, they were wrongfully compensated for the damage, which amounted to almost 2 million crowns.
The shoemaker is now a witness in the case, after the Supreme Court's intervention.
His wife works in the courthouse at the fruit market, settles civil disputes.
However, Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful and avoid possible objections.
So, apparently, the case will be handled by another Prague district court.
The Queen has already twice acquitted the former Nagy.
It was about the alleged use of military intelligence to spy on the first wife of Prime Minister Necass Radka.
The Bludger wasn't involved in this case.
But according to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be construed as excluding the court from considering whether the witness has a spouse or a relative in court.
I'm afraid there's no way to prosecute anything, he noted for the diary.
"It seems to me to be a slippery slope", he added.
In the case of political trafficking is also accused Roman Bocek, a former official.
But according to his lawyer, Peter Tomana, any objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Peter Nečas, Janna Nagy (now Nečasová), and others accused in the case of abuse of military intelligence.
In the footage, Time and her husband are coming to court.
Tluchová was supposed to deal with the Perutka allegations.
For example, the wife of the exposlance was supposed to judge the remarks of President Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinando Peroutko.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an Allied air raid.
She flew to Syria with two of her oldest girlfriends last February from London's Gatwick Airport.
The British Home Office has not commented on the news of her death.
Young Londoners who ran away from home were smuggled across the Turkish border into Syria, police said.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are reportedly heading for their other former classmate from London's Bethnal Green Academy.
The incident last year has caused a huge amount of attention and also strained relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security services estimate that about 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, of which about 50 are young women and girls.
Many of them joined the radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred grand.
High-paying jobs that don't even require a college degree.
That's what a real-estate agent looks like.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech conditions (in Prague you can earn up to CZK 180 000 working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge shortage of IT specialists.
We're missing thousands of specialists.
It is estimated that there is a shortage of almost 20 000 IT specialists in the Czech Republic.
The most sought-after, according to Grafton's recruitment agency statistics, are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose from a number of job offers.
So it is not the candidates who compete for the job, but the job for the candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a requirement.
But college is not a requirement for the I.T. guys.
A college education provides a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate's intelligence and education, but it often has little to do with developmental knowledge.
Developers need to learn new things all the time, which is not something that a university degree can replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He makes most of it in Prague.
The salaries of the auto workers are everywhere well above the republican average.
The biggest money is in Prague and Brno, in the regions it's not so big.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague", confirms Kubačka.
The highest-paid CEOs are the ones who make the most money.
In Prague and Brno, they can get 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions the salary is lower, but it does not fall below 80 000 CZK.
IT project managers are also in demand.
They can earn between $5,000 and $5,000 on their first day.
The fight is about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not the case for IT workers.
Because if companies can drag and overpay an expert from another company, they're happy to reach out to a graduate.
They can raise him on their own terms.
They can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in any profession, but for foreigners, at least a decent level of English is essential.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a requirement for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we see a number of cases where companies are looking for a highly educated and experienced person and are satisfied with only an average knowledge of English.
However, if a support worker, for example, speaks several foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds Director Kubačka.
Yo, Google, there is a paradise.
You're the only one who can envy Czech workers to Google employees.
Flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home, and various reduced hours are a matter of course for them, not just for moms.
"New fathers are given an extra four weeks of leave after the birth of their child", says Google spokeswoman Martina Jonek.
The company also provides healthcare for employees and their families, meals, transportation, training, wellness and massage services directly at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn has a green light, and it doesn't matter what new things they want to learn.
But the benefits don't end there.
A free refrigerator like that is definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (and in some locations breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all offices, where people can always find healthy snacks, the speaker reveals.
And to avoid waste, what is not eaten is put into boxes that the employees can take home at night.
And the reason for these incredible advantages in Czech terms?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it's not important that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions", adds the spokesperson.
The UN has sharply criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law", warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly disturbing to witness how important and influential public figures are publicly expressing support for criminal armed militants who are brazenly organizing refugee hunts on the Bulgarian-Turkish border".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested", Zeid stressed.
And to make matters worse, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that under international law, everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared to 21,000 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - A Health and Happiness Quest That Pays Off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Many people have lamented over the past decade that teenagers and children are no longer playing outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go is a way to get people off their couches and into action.
Screen time has been reduced to television, then video games, and most recently, smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I'm talking, of course, about the newest trend, which is Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (and later became a cartoon, a trading card game, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in the new game before its launch in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to the huge interest that led to the overload of the servers.
Pokémon Go gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter in a few days.
How does it work?
In short, smartphone players go out to look for Pokémon that they track with GPS, and when they find them, they can "take a picture" (via a screenshot on their phone) or "capture" them.
Mania has taken over a generation who played the game at a younger age, picking it up off the seats and running out looking for Pokemon.
In the United States, the game has led to a dramatic increase in the number of steps taken by the average person every day.
The Cardiogram app, a smartwatch from Apple that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of its launch, the number of people tracked who exercised for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company doesn't have information about who's playing Pokémon Go - they only see rough data on the levels of practice.
A lot of public campaigns to get people to reach 30 and get off their couch and be active every day have fallen on hard times, because most public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don't look good.
Still, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity contributes to weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can't list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something that they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air, and sunshine.
Some people even make new friends while chasing Pokémon.
Of course, as is usually the case, there are also some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk through the door.
What, like?
He was a breakthrough.
At one time, smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do something like this game did.
The novelty becomes obvious, and interest in it begins to wane at a certain point.
But thanks to the success of Pokémon, other games will emerge that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, and help a lot of people in their quest for activity, health, and better fitness.

Simone Biles won gold in the women 's gymnastics .
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort on the stump.
The commoners all fell silent.
Excellent in all areas.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the silver medal on Thursday and took the Olympic spotlight by a landslide.
Her total score of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and member of the "final five" team Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a pole vault performance in the final of the individual all-around in gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row to win multiple fights, and fifth overall, as she cemented her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her final overall assessment was on the board and her long journey to this moment was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success puts her in the same league as the extraordinary athletes of her time, like Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 golds. Her breathtaking formations are a blend of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen".
The final challenge was in Brazil, not between Biles and the rest of the field, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything less than returning home to my family in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning the gold and silver medals in the women's singles event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles won the first one on Tuesday, when she was the cheerleader at the departure party of national team coordinator Marthy Karolyi.
Biles insists that during her long climb to the top, she never looked ahead, which is not entirely true.
Part of her solo lineup - the one that includes her signature triple-jump double-turn - is set to Latin music that would have been perfectly suited for the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted as a toddler by her grandparents and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The competition in the high jump hasn't lost since the summer of 2013 - that's a winning streak that can go on for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina took the lead for a short while with two turnovers, it was just an illusion.
The column and the simple - where Biles defends the world championship - wait.
She got back to the lead with 15,433 points per game and finished with 15,933 points in the singles.
Raisman embraced her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glowing shades of red, white and blue, Biles's tears appeared as a wish she had written down in her diary as a child was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a little like payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but then she won bronze for the best three-way combined.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call the "Women's Whip", was well ahead of the game.
She sent a crowd of air kisses to her laymen, with a return that seemed at times uncertain.
For Biles, the post that the 19-year-old athlete made on Twitter this week, where it became a huge hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died in the most significant attack of the decade, the first serial murder in Phoenix, when they were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot and killed June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report states that the gunman stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight rounds with a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the robbery is not a triple homicide because the assailant didn't take the wallets or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators are looking into whether the shooting was related to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks occurred in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
"It's happening in the mansion district in front of the house", Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown late '90s Nissan, a black late '90s BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to say what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not uncommon for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities have also released a police report of a shooting that targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple homicide, which police believe was carried out by this serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and bullet residue in the seat and assembled a bullet from under the hood.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: His condition is improving 
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first thing I thought was I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you're ready for that, she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even recommended that he be institutionalized.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do that anymore", explains Picciut.
Edmund walks with a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still can't talk.
But some milestones are already being reached.
He walks with a cane and rides a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth is giving a sign language in which Edmund says, "Please sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not just sign language - he says that Edmund invented some of the signs himself.
Microcephaly can develop from a number of different conditions: from genetics, as in Edmund's case, to infections during pregnancy caused by viruses, such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary considerably.
It's too early to tell what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional toll that an uncertain future takes.
I keep asking myself, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciut has an encouraging message for the mothers of all children who suffer from the birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are looking up.
Just know that it's gonna get better.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding have required rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme flooding, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are overflowing and threatening to flood.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is on the way to affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's office of national security and emergency preparedness, said they're getting requests for water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for 10,000 sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain in place in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The National Weather Service said in a statement that the sea surface may be rained out by another eight to 13 centimeters.
In southern Alabama, flood watch was on alert Friday as rains continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are predicted to peak this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood a row of houses in the Baton Rouge suburban areas.
He also said that the danger is downstream flooding in Ascension County, where these watered-down streams will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on record as early as 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking people up from the tidal waters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and their stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday at Gloster.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was tipped off by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming", Hansford said.
I had her up to my waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's seen on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all the members of his family are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three of the giant military-style trucks and had taken them to the Gloucester fire station, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuing heavy rains, the flooding is spreading rapidly and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that from midnight Friday to early morning, 35 centimeters of rain fell.
Krautmann said the ground was heavily wet from Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and tolling caused residents to be evacuated from their homes in Tangipahoa County and that school districts in five districts were canceled.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that an elderly man in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the high water.
Shelters have been set up in the town of Amite and the town of Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to recede", he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to flooding, and residents were provided with sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from flooding.
"The last big flood we had here was in March", said Lacy Landrum, the town manager.
It looks like these floods are gonna be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the emergency manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said that the Gulf Coast is experiencing a continuous rainfall.
He said that a few houses were reported flooded Thursday, but none of them were in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and it's still there".
Mahaj Brown, 6 - The boy who was shot like a loaf of bread, survived the Philadelphia shooting.
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The baby's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
The boy's parents say he suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He had a terrible cough, his little body was shot through like a hailstorm", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station the boy should recover.
He was supposed to be entering the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown section.
Three other men were shot: two men aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the men, a 29-year-old man, is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, with two other victims in stable condition.
According to the station's report, a child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the vehicle, and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia say there was a possible gunfight between several armed men.
At the scene, shells from assault weapons belonging to various assault weapons were found.
It seems to be an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved", Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing the CCTV footage.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday outside a home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering, and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is exactly how I envision the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympics, for a number of reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have inspired so many young women of color.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
It also cemented the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast for the past four years was an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were first and second last year.
That's got to mean something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals was the surprise Olympic champion, and America was roaring.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible feat of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have performed unexpected but masterful gymnastic feats.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
And team member Aly Raisman took the silver.
We're witnessing the pinnacle of sports, but in the gymnastics classes in the country, it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the Olympic team the same way Aly and Madison did.
They're the final five, because the gymnastics team for the next Olympics will be made up of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi will be training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a very expensive sport, and gymnasts train mostly in private gyms, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, equipment, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for the coaches and their guardians and families) and that's not all.
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent suburban areas that can support the activities.
These clubs are where gymnasts have all the training, and for families of gymnasts, it's a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both coached athletes when they were starting out in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie have inspired.
I started the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 youth within the city (mostly black and Hispanic) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we're expanding to Detroit, where we're going to provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to us who will want to do gymnastics.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing the strength of a girl and winning Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the journey of becoming healthy, strong, successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected, the young doctors are ready to enter into more strikes.
Ministers hoped that the British Medical Association (BMA) would end their disagreements over the changes after the revised contract was signed, but 58% of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected the contract.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in "no-man's-land" and that any further delay would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend working procedures to improve care during non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that it will increase the current workforce crisis and therefore the fair treatment of all doctors".
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be under contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have been met with reluctance to engage and often deafening silence from the government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that the possibility is still open.
Jeremy Hunt must now act, pushing for enforcement and addressing the concerns of young doctors.
If that doesn't happen, then the young doctors are ready to take the next step.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed because nurses and specialists were called in to replace doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that the conclusion of the revised contract with the British Medical Association (BMA) would resolve differences on the amendments.
The BMA is demanding higher pay for the work on weekends for 54,000 young doctors who would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the chairman of the NHS Employers, has called on young doctors not to join any strike.
Mortimer said: 'The campaign will achieve little or nothing, but will put pressure on already overburdened teams and services and increase anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, carers and their families.'
In the past two months, we've been talking to a number of young doctors and, along with the Ministry of Health and others, we've responded positively to their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the whistleblower.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as occupancy, flexibility in training, further training for those returning from a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and the gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health take the agreements reached with the BMA in October, February and May.
A drug for $0.50 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will be able to take the drug, which costs an average of about $1.60, and the authorities recommend that it be given to more patients over a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a relapse in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of these suffer another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a buildup of fat that forms a continuous layer on the walls of arteries.
If this layer is torn, blood clots may form, blocking the blood supply to the heart, and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream can continue, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at greater risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to occur.
The draft NICE guideline published today recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice daily for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: 'Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatment, a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack will have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.'
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that by pre-suggesting Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because the information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the design.
With computer culture, the scams in Muslim areas began to flourish.
The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to the overlooking of rampant fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Former minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticised the police, election inspectors and the council for ignoring voter fraud due to "sensitivities to ethnicity and religion".
The former community secretary, now the head of the anti-corruption task force, said that intimidating voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should put a cordon around the polling stations and protect the voters who are being intimidated.
He recommended that voters bring identification papers with them so they could prove who they are when voting.
At present, all voters need to do is provide their name and address.
The report also suggests that people's fingers should be inked with indelible ink when they cast their ballot, to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It calls for greater access to documents from meetings and to decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
'It is not just about protecting against electoral fraud, but also protecting local governments from the wider corruption and financial fraud that go hand in hand,' he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in west London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the city's incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office after being accused of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman cynically harmed the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said he had campaigned to make it a religious duty for devout Muslims to vote for him.
As many as 300 votes were contested or stolen as a result of identity theft, where one person votes and impersonates another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about mail-in voting fraud - allegedly by senior members of the Muslim community who pressured people to vote for the candidate they had elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presenting identification
Its report states: 'Evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of their elders, particularly in communities originating from Pakistan and Bangladesh.'
There were concerns that... state institutions were turning a blind eye to such behaviour because of political correctness and a sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from tampering with correspondence votes to prevent 'votes being abused'.
The report, which is now being assessed by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registration to prevent voter rolls from being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to produce identification before voting.
The use of indelible ink on the fingers of people when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Systematically checking the nationality of persons to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
To limit requests for automatic correspondence voting to three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating the votes and envelopes submitted by correspondents.
Give the police authority to create cordonages around the polling stations.
To change the law to make it easier to prosecute people who exert unlawful pressure under the Reform Act of 1983.
Ban the taking of photographs in the polling stations.
To require that only Englishmen (except for Welshmen) work in the polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that staff adhere to the rule of individual voter attendance at polling stations.
Sir Eric is critical of the London police, saying it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court has disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices", he said.
On a number of grounds, he was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on the strength of the evidence of a crime.
He also criticises the ineffective 'check of check boxes' in the voter registration departments at the town hall.
Sir Eric said: "The last year's judgment in the Tower Hamlets case is a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the rejection rate by some bodies are threatening that reputation.
The infatuation of the cycling double of Duchess Kate and other famous double at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have been raving this week about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who bears a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic champion is far from the only gold-medalist this year to boast a celebrity double - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL's women's column has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who bear more than a passing resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
Hunted: U.S. archer Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio when he was a child
Along with Kate's twin on the cycling track, a number of people online were quick to point out that a certain archer might be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archery team athlete Brady Ellison has caused a Twitter storm after images of him looking remarkably like a Wall Street wolf surfaced.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted he'd heard about his similarities to Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't see much resemblance to him, except maybe the beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's a cool guy and he looks good, so I guess that's a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be highlighted even more this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin, with her large, expressive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell star Matthew Morrison for years.
And for a change, the user thinks that Nathan is an athletic version of the actor from the movie Inception.
Another longstanding comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same brown braids and blond hair as Annalynne McCord, but also the look of Nathan Adrian of Team USA, who fans say looks like an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levit.
Married women: Soccer star Hope Sol (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial and eye shapes
Not just one: Twitter user was delighted to see the similarity
On the theory of waves: This user thinks there might be a reason behind the similar appearance of the pairs
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction that the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.
Football star Hope Sol and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter really do have an incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings with a smile that is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, or gymnastics gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who boasts of a beautifully broad smile that seems to copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of Bravo Girls!
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimsuit "blasted out"
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast of the Olympic Games on CBC were outraged by the analysis of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance by commentator Byron MacDonald, who finished fourth in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "sniffed" and "blown up" during the race.
Sports commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started spewing his opinions at the end of the women's 4x200 freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring the "revival" to the CBC commentary team, said, among other things, "That 14-year-old girl from China gave up, you piece of shit".
Too much excitement, she's dragging like a stink, she's blown to bits.
Thank you, sir.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) completed the second relay in a time of 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers in Canada started to respond online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC announcer say that a 14 year old swimmer from China "exploded"?????"
That idiot didn't realize it was still on.
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay race was described as: That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you idiot.
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides, with many calling for his removal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald. I'm so proud of you, you are a great guy.'
You represent the CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for the live commentary by MacDonald, saying: "We apologize for the commentary on the swimmer's performance that was leaked to the broadcast".
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry it happened.
The CBC eventually apologized over 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment.
Co-host Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and pasted their apology into a reply to over 90 Twitter users who complained about commentator MacDonald's comments.
The station also quickly apologized and released a statement.
He sincerely regrets that those words were spoken, they should not have been aired.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and those who follow us on social media.
Just to be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the yacht, not the yacht itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized live on television and tried to explain his remark by saying that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay", he said on the CBC broadcast of the Olympics.
I meant the performance of a swimmer, not the person of a swimmer.
Needless to say, I had no disrespect in mind, and I am very sorry.
Shoppers in Primark were outraged by a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of a store.
When a woman stripped to try on her panties on a sales counter in the middle of Primark, shoppers were not sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she was trying to figure out how to fit her size, so she took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Flokestone.
Primark store at Bouverie Place, Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, who was in the store at the time, said the mystery woman tried on her underwear and left without buying anything.
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes".
She stood in the middle of the store, took the panties off the shelf, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, cocky as a monkey.
Everyone was watching her take off her panties again, and obviously she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.
She did the same with three others before finally deciding she didn't like anything, getting dressed again and leaving.
She seemed to have no qualms about who was watching - not even thinking about the person who might buy the panties she was trying on.
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: 'The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else has been wearing and no one has cleaned them is disgusting.'
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: "When she left, I collected the things she had obviously tried to get me to take off the sale - which is also the only thing that was right".
It would scare me to think that I would bring home a new pair of panties and find that another woman had been wearing them, had taken them off, and hadn't washed them.
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9".
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the market.
How to defend against an assault weapon using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous out there, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little bit safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video shows you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over an abuser, whether they approach you from the front or from behind.
If they approach you from behind, says Mizrachi, the first thing you need to do is turn around to see your attacker and have a clear shot.
You then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then it follows the knee into the groin, and as the attacker writhes in pain, you take the gun out of his hand, you hit him in the face with the head, and you start to back off, keeping the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun, and blunt it so the bad guy can't fire.
At the same time, apply the force to the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then deflect the weapon from its grip and begin to retreat, still aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of a robbery - unless you're a grand master of Krav Maga - is to give up all your cash.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British explorer decided to put his immune system and astonishing reflexes to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The host and contributor Ian Wright, 51, originally from Suffolk, has licked a euro banknote, a rail bar in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet and a Russian public telephone with his tongue as proof of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a light meter to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment that inspired the movie Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, did produce some interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train that thousands of other people have used may seem utterly repulsive, but there are actually many more harmful bacteria in a kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip across Europe, Ian Wright talked to doctors and health professionals about boosting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left anything worse than a bad taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright became famous for testing the strength of his intestines on his world tours and for eating both strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he safely tested his immune system from public railway station railings to the alarm system.
In a film he made about it, he says: "Since childhood, I have not taken much care of my health and have put everything into my mouth, from mud to eating worms and muddy water".
He certainly lived up to his reputation in the movie.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple flick, the luminometer showed a value of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but licked refused after his luminometer showed over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio have made a travelogue called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in various places, like the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "This is about the most disgusting feeling I've ever felt in a bathroom".
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to boost intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio's senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: 'We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would keep an eye on the interest and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "Let's call Ian".
It is said that concern about intestinal health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
So instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context -- the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it's connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted him to do - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film".
Some things were naturally easier for Ian to lick, others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we caught some of the dirty things licking.
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that found 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent of respondents reported at least occasional use of products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family in need of social assistance before being evicted damaged a council house in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of the underprivileged left £50,000 worth of damage to their council house after being accused of terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction, the housing authority was shocked to find the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were full of holes, the floor covering was torn, the floor was covered with debris, and the walls were smeared.
The family has already moved and is believed to be staying in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house could be saved.
She said: "It was a nightmare for people here and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a number of factors to consider, as this property is likely to be recognised as a not-so-pretty part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, and their names are infamous.
The couple has three sons who were occasional visitors, and police said the terror the family inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, distribution of drugs, and loud shouting, arguments and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given a punishment for antisocial behaviour in June.
In several rooms of the house that may be demolished, stinking garbage was found.
The house where the drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn off.
Neighbors say they saw them arguing in the street, and people regularly called the police here.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from their home this week after being given an additional 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
Neighbors, relieved, welcomed the eviction with the feeling that their lives were living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anybody".
We lived next door for 20 years and it was always like this.
We've seen the police here more times than you can count.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We stood up because it was incredibly quiet - we're not used to that!
It'll be nice to finally get them out of here.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the neighborhood oversight manager for Cornwall Housing, said the family failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were called to the house regularly
Trash and old toys were lying around in the overgrown part of the town hall
He adds: 'It is a shame that the tenants have failed to take responsibility for their own behaviour and that of their family.
It was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, must have frightened her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the local community members have done to bravely inform us.
I hope this move will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time send a message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenant's sons who lived in the house at different times were in their 20s.
A contaminated mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the move
Workers will now have to remove the piles of rubbish that remained around the house
In 2014, officers raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, scales, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of a Class B drug that she was attempting to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundation of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth after being evicted.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the terms of their leases
Angela Crow of Denov and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behaviour", she said.
Denov and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after a military jet overflows the beach
Tourists enjoying the sunshine in Aveiro, Portugal, were scared to death
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion was flying incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight, and insisted there was no threat to safety.
As the low-flying jet crashed over the crowded beach, panic gripped the terrified tourists.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane coming within a near-touch range of sunbathing people on a sandy beach near Aveiro, in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet engines, without seeing what was emerging from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova, near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreationalists who posted videos of the dramatic overflying on social media, said: "The plane flew twice really low and at one point it looked like it was going to crash".
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were shocked when a low-flying plane appeared from the darkness.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of a P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing vessel off the coast and had to fly low because it was the only way to inspect the vessel.
The plane reportedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires, but the Air Force insists that no safety concerns were raised.
Forest fires have ravaged parts of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to the dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing the plane.
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels as part of the training.
Half the funeral homes don't follow the rules.
Half of the funeral service providers are not following the law.
This was found by the Czech Trade Inspectorate (ČOI) during the checks in the second quarter.
Most funeral services do not inform the deceased of their prices or issue a written acknowledgement of receipt of the order.
The CIO imposed 41 fines for a total of 73,000 crowns.
This was announced today by its spokesman, George Fröhlich.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 checks.
In addition to price-delaying and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and in one case the seller used an instrument that was not officially certified.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
This concerned urn packaging, candle holders and vases which were not properly labelled with the mandatory information.
'Given that there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year,' added Fröhlich.
A London schoolgirl who joined IS has been killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, had died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in Syrian Raqqa several weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Raksa, the group's stronghold in the country.
The sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee her war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One would like to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are real dangers associated with going to a war zone - is that it discourages people from ever making a decision", Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana's family learned that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he'll keep Garland as the Supreme Court nominee.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's nomination even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person who will replace the late Supreme Court justice will be chosen by the next president.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he believes Clinton will pick Garland with a certain degree of credibility.
Reid's spokesman later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he had only speculated.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't have picked anyone else to rock the boat.
Garland is the chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are the "hands" and "spokesmen" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for women and men.
Treats is working closely with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 2017 calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of revealing celebrities, NU Muses is looking to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do it for the women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We must return to the timeless and classic depiction of nudity, where women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the female body", said Shaw in a press release to launch the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit their photos online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl going: who's really buying records?
Vinyl is a favorite of lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to clutter the comments section with peppered notes under the pseudonym Not All Lonely Men in the Middle Ages, please note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of the gramophone records is not connected to the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of owning a physical object, but to the nostalgia of middle age.
The people who have recently bought a vinyl album are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not even about building a fan base - it's about the emotional side: older people who buy records are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and like to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, the camera would follow me as I drive into a busy street in Soho, wearing a decent gray suit and gesturing broadly, then I would stop, reach out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's see what we can do".
Let's take a look at it.
While the heart of Soho is losing its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent retailers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and eateries, clothing stores and office supplies - a few fantastic specialty record shops remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment, and I'd stand up close to the different men in these stores and try to detect their age and emotional state.
Stuart, 55, a Glasgow native who I've been tracking from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman in her 20s), has an afternoon meeting in London and is looking at the shops to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so", he says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All of these tapes are on the walls of his living room - pictured above (he sent me the photo by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles is also because he can afford it: he can now buy the records that he couldn't afford when they were originally released, and he can buy again what he sold in his youth and didn't have a penny.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, and these are things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12 years old, and I was too young to get them", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are likely to be introverts who like to be with themselves, and he adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez, 25, works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers she meets fit the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old turntables back.
According to my interviews, the most common time people dumped their collections was between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back", he says.
That could explain the boom in turntables lovers at a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of the record?
It takes you no more than a few seconds to find that in a store like Phonica's, you find a pleasant community of like-minded people in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly upset with the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have chosen the familiar environment of vinyl records, the things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think filling a void or having something material can bring a certain comfort", says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people are.
It's an easy way to fill up space in your head.
"We are all like their social workers!" exclaims a coworker from the stack of phonograph records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier hadn't even listened to it.
According to the survey, 41 percent of the respondents own a phonograph that they never use, while 7 percent of those who buy records do not own a phonograph.
At this point in the report, he probably looked seriously worried about going through a bunch of bossa nova compilations.
The 'trophy' aspect and the revival of interest is something that Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Someone came to me recently and said, 'I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than the music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a gramophone".
It's younger people, not older, mature teenagers, who get into it.
Fopp, where almost an entire floor is now dedicated to phonograph records, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops used to be, with the latest Wild Beasts pop music, full of synthesizers and sex, being played from the speakers instead of the jazzy jazz, it's good to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the amount of psychological trauma is hard to gauge when you've been standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, takes a few minutes to walk around the Fopp, looking at the various phonograph records in the drawer.
She's one of those people who'd rather look at expenses than spend it all.
She says she doesn't make much money, so it's not like she's collecting gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the gramophone records have a magic...
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My final stop is a store that's said to have inspired a new generation of record-lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I'm pretending to be a very prejudiced bunch of girls in tight jeans and I'm watching a bunch of teenage girls huddle around Polaroid cameras and then a father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley gramophone.
On the left is a staircase, the walls covered with gramophone records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just for decoration and some are so high up on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's a whole vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers deep into Soho for another, there's not much to complain about.
It's no surprise that the demographic that's likely to have more time and money than any other is also the one that spends the most on the most luxurious goods, which vinyl certainly is.
But while my findings seem to be that YouGov's results are accurate -- at least in the record stores, they don't account for the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in the record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
They certainly don't spend Thursday mornings wandering through the record shops on Berwick Street, sifting through the records and avoiding the gaze of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest average life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nielsen says the recording shows a female estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long
A French court refused to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a government order in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to close 72 temporary shops, where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents or basic food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian organizations argued in court that shops and restaurants are vital, and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups do not provide supplemental food for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 temporary shops, but stated that the objections of the Prefect of Calais were 'quite understandable'.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just serving food to people who are living in extremely desperate conditions.
He said the barracks provide quiet meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites threatened with demolition was the camp's cafeteria, Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a nonprofit organization that provides 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum counseling for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The Guardian has received a letter saying that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as 8 years old.
Charity organisations Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp had risen to more than 9,000 after a sharp increase in arrivals over the summer - the highest ever to date.
He thought he was dead.
The buck is calling themselves and the volleyball team is calling the mouth.
"Since March I've been able to train normally", he said, entering the start of the summer training in full force.
What was wrong with you?
I had a double pulmonary embolism, then heart trouble because of it.
Because when I was in college in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
It hurt, nobody found anything for me.
Then the clot got up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, and it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when you're working or the weather's changing.
But nothing to limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you afraid for your life?
I did.
Last year at the summer tournament in Woodstock, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move at all.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something else entirely, and I was completely out for five days.
I really thought I was dead in the Woodlands, and so did my friends and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I've had to experience it, now it's only going up.
I know I have some blood issues, that I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything with it.
It's just that when I was about to go back to prep for the Supplements last year, heart problems came up.
Everything is fine now.
Since March, I've been conditioning myself at home so I can play again.
I'll knock it off, I'm physically better than before.
What do you expect from the mouth?
I'm excited. The gang looks good. I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners who will be coming.
I hope we can sit down like humans so we can fit in.
You're going to lift the Mouth?
It had a reputation for being a bit of a bumpkin, but every season is different.
Two years ago, it was eighth, now it's second.
There's a new team in the Ustia, only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extraction, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see who's the big shot after the first few rounds, but not us.
Is coach Brom the guarantee of success?
He's experienced and has seen a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last one.
But my coming here had nothing to do with him. I made an appointment.
There were other coaches involved, one of whom I'm good friends with, and it was agreed that he would be here.
I won't say his name.
Mr. Brom finally came, and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's coached for decades, he's a former good player.
It'll take us up.
What do you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to laugh, and I like to get a shot at a not-so-high-end team.
I was in the Mines for two years, but the Mouth is more of a challenge than being in the Sixers, because you start from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, an Australian Boehm is training in Ustia.
What's it look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in college.
And we've had a few fun times together, sometimes sitting together after the game, so we're already friends.
We beat them 3-1, I just told him that at the start of the summer training in Usti.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been talking to an American, he seems like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so I'm supposed to communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out who the player was, I found some videos on the Internet of his playing, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid's a jumper, he's tall.
We posted a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'd fit in.
How are you looking forward to being number one on the record charts?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm 24 years old and I don't have the temperament to take turns.
I'd rather be in the middle of it, I'd rather lead the team than have someone else lead it.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I had to be a second recording artist and do it full time, because if you don't do it full time, it sucks.
How many times were you number one?
Half a season in the Mines, when Kust was not doing well as captain, he got injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
We've been climbing ever since, and I've been playing all the time.
I was the number one and number two in Brno, where I'm the head boy.
I had a great year in Old Town, and I had a lot of offers, and I chose the Prop.
That's where the Buddies wanted me, so I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short-term remains Phelps' domain.
"It's sweet as ever to be back on the winning step and hear the anthem", laughed Phelps, his eyes filled with tears again.
His fiancée and mother were back in the audience, this time his son Boomer was asleep peacefully with a headset.
I'm having a great career-ending week.
It's crazy - I started competitive swimming 20 years ago, and in a few hours it's all over, he said, touched.
In the final, Phelps was just two seconds behind the silver-medal winner, Kosuke Hagino of Japan, who won the long jump.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, the bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's world championships.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (pitch), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four consecutive games.
For most of the race, Phelps was held at the top by fellow American Ryan Lochte and home team member Thiago Perreira.
While the defending gold in the final Kraular fifty put to the crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the official announcement of his position, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly.
The legend couldn't be eclipsed by compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the signature double - after winning 100 in Rio and double track.
In the final, he was beaten by 37 cents by Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, and third by Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy was fifth in the 200 meters at last year's world championships, he became the king of the 200 meters in Rio.
He has dethroned Larkina, who was the same double at last year's world championship.
But he's only just won a medal in the Olympics.
In the 100m butterfly, gold was shared by Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel.
It was the fourth medal for 16-year-old Oleksiak at the games, and the second silver for Manuel in the relay.
She won the Olympic swimming gold as the first African-American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
"This medal is for all those who will come after me, who will love sport and will go as far as I have", said the touched Manuel.
Third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who set a world record in the 100-meter butterfly in Rio and also took silver in the 200-meter butterfly.
The world record holder, Cate Campbell, from Australia, finished sixth.
The women's 200m was won by Japan's Rie Kanet, who won her first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
She doesn't have any precious metals from the world championships, her best was fourth in the world in 2013.
The second silver medalist in Rio was Russia's Julia Yefimova, who, despite her doping history, has faced the hostility of both spectators and competitors for her Olympic debut.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the court case, and I don't know why I have to keep answering these questions.
"I'm so tired of it", said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was won by a special panel of CAS sports arbitration just before the games began.
They were dealing with my appeal, and I won.
Whether anyone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, they should go to the arbitration tribunal, she added.
Disappointing, we could have won.
And the launch at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
They've only known who they're going to play against an hour before the game.
They must have been able to get through the tactical preparation like a lightning bolt.
And then, at an unusual time, the game began on the small number one court.
The first set didn't start well, then they took the lead, but at 19:19 they couldn't finish.
In the second, they were clearly better and tied, but the decisive tie-break didn't work out.
In particular, a series of broken serves meant a 10:15 loss and the end of the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians", Hermann lamented.
How would you rate the match?
After a bad start, before I started, we got into the game.
I finally lost the last balloon, which I had become accustomed to.
We lost a set, which was crucial.
In the next set, we came at them with a field overlook, another defense, and we pushed on the serve.
There was a terrible serve in the tie-break, and we took over this side.
It was a disappointment because we could have beaten the Russians.
It's a shame we lost the first set.
We were able to pull it off, but we were missing the points.
Second set was great, and third set was a service decision.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and that's five points, and we were hesitating a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were very playful.
How did you like playing Little Yard 1?
Slukova: Similar to the ones in China in the backyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock in the morning, it was completely silent, no music playing, nothing.
That was a difference from the center.
We wouldn't have chosen these conditions, but we can't choose them.
How was the prep for the game when you learned the names of the opponents an hour before the game?
She was strange.
We started practicing for the match without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't do tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon had prepared his tactics for almost every possibility that was out there.
He had a lot of tactical papers lined up, so we were pretty well prepared after this page.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Sophia: I suppose not.
We played at half past ten, but not at twelve.
Ruska Birlov's block in the play-off prelims at the OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann hugging in the playoff pre-season at OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in the group of ten, we had the mode shifted earlier.
This was two hours too long.
It's strange, I can't imagine any other sport having athletes who have to perform at their best in 12 hours.
But I think we've prepared ourselves as best we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not exactly typical and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the group's progress was our goal, it's okay on the one hand, good.
We did what we said we would.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
I'll sleep on it and from tomorrow onwards I'll remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother is here, coming up first surveillance SIM.
You can't escape from her.
The new rules are to apply to all non-Thai passport holders who decide to get a SIM card from a local operator while in Thailand.
Not just tourists, but also people with long-term visas who work in Thailand or who have married there.
The Secretary General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, has informed that there will be no exceptions.
The plan to sell SIM cards intended exclusively for foreigners was unveiled by the national telecoms regulator in early August.
The new measures to track their locations are expected to be in place within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a national security tool that will allow us to deal with criminal activity by foreigners.
The so-called tourist SIMs are also intended to help detect persons who exceed the authorised length of stay.
In addition to the SIM designed exclusively for Thais, retailers should also be able to sell a special SIM for foreigners within six months.
The difference will be the tracking feature, which will be permanently on for cards intended for non-Thai passport holders.
There's no way to shut it off.
"This feature is not available on Thai SIMs, because we can always track them easily", Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave away free launch SIM cards to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecom regulators from other Asian countries including Malaysia and Singapore are also considering the same measure as Thailand.
They are also currently required to register a SIM, but the tracking system cannot be used legally.
The measure does not, however, impose an obligation on foreigners to obtain a SIM card from a local operator when entering the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own domestic SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
After crossing the border, that is, after the SIM has logged on to their network, the operators of the country concerned only know the relevant network information.
So they know the phone number, but they don't know the owner.
However, the difference between roaming prices and local operators' rates is so wide that even most tourists will look for local SIM cards during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to monitor the movement of foreigners were immediately criticized by foreigners living in Thailand legally.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the upcoming system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents in the context of privacy protection.
In addition, the police will need a court order if they need to follow a specific person.
Any abuse of the system will be met with unspecified punishment.
"If a service provider tracks the location of a SIM without a court order, they will be charged with a criminal offence", Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should also maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While currently a specific number is only recycled after a 90-day period has elapsed after the SIM has not logged on to the network, in the new case, the number could be renewed after 15 days if the SIM leaves Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose the apartment in the new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where the property manager would take care of most of the property.
The condition was that there was enough parking and an elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older development.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old buildings, the problems with the floor wobbles, the high energy demands and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old settlement is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in Modern Apartment magazine.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer with her colleague Kamil Polák of Artiga Studio.
Why did you approach them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend working with an architect to anyone designing an apartment from scratch, because it's a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of materials available and are able to tailor the interior according to the client's wishes.
We had already worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation from another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us to rebuild our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a spacious social-living space with adequate facilities for a family of four, conceived as modern, but not cold interiors.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment to the terraces and to implement the intelligent control of the home.
And of course, the quality of the work had to be considered.
Did you leave it to the experts or did you interfere with the final design of the interior?
We approved all the designs, including the engineering drawings and the samples of the materials, but the design always came from the architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we wanted from the design, and we showed some of the interior elements that we wanted to incorporate into the design, like carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špály or Otto Gutfreund, helped us to orient ourselves in our taste.
The combination of black, white, and walnut wood was also the architect's idea, as were the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, and so forth.
Were there any complications in the implementation that made you give up your original ideas or move on to new ones?
It was probably only in the early stages of the project, when we came to the building, at the moment when it was possible for the first time to climb up to the height of our floor, that we found that the views that we had planned were actually shadowing the surrounding buildings.
We literally changed the layout overnight.
Granite was used for the kitchen cables and for the fireplace wall cladding.
The interior is dominated by leather-enhanced wood surfaces, such as the upholstery of Arper's Norma dining and bar chairs.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or is there anything you wish you had done differently today?
I think it's a modern, airy interior that serves its purpose above all else.
We're not planning on making any changes, most of the post-moving has been done in the area of shading and terrace occupation.
Perhaps the only reproach is to the floor, where the walnut tree is shown to be too delicate for a dog's home.
The word of the architect, Lenka Langer and the architect, Kamila Hornych, the author of the project.
The apartment is on the top floor of a new building, which made it possible to make a completely new layout and some other modifications during the construction.
For the interior, the placement of the LEDs in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet is an important element.
It brought daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, the direct access from the master bath to the roof terrace to the pool by the USSPA is one of the structural modifications that was very beneficial to the function of the entire apartment.
It also includes a pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are of Algerian origin.
I was born in the south of France, not far from the Spanish border.
I've moved around a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which led to a job at a magazine.
So why did you decide to leave the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mostly because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought all French people were so negative.
People in France are generally negative, but lately it's gotten worse.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
That's how some people judge Czech character.
Believe me, compared to the French, you're not negative.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France, because they don't notice it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is €15, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with people's attitude towards Muslims.
It's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking down on me just because I was a Muslim.
Like I was some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
My family stayed behind.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work pretty much anywhere else and I came across an opening at Air France here in Prague.
I confess I didn't know Prague at all when I started.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of the whole new atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or insults, but I feel that people here are more free.
That I can do anything, wear anything, and no one will judge me.
In France, you always get a bad look, because of your strange clothes and such.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think the people of Prague care about such things.
Where are you working now?
After Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then a friend and I started a website where people can list and search for shared housing.
We're only in Prague at the moment, but we'd like to expand to all of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half Czech, and two more Czech friends.
I must say that another specificity of the Czechs is that they are more distant at first.
They don't let anyone in so easily.
It's quite different from where I grew up.
In the South, everyone hugs and kisses each other's cheeks.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
In Prague, it's pretty easy for me, because I think everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And since everyone can communicate in English at least a little bit, I don't have that much of a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone there to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not exactly.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that's more tolerant.
I have one experience that comes to mind.
My manager, Czek, once told me about a French football team and made a point of saying: "They're not French, they're Africans".
That was quite touching.
But for anyone to have a problem with me being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
And that's despite the fact that a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the center, that I would be called names.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to what happened in Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, these days, anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I couldn't imagine something like this happening in France.
And it's not just the Muslims.
Besides, Islam does not condone violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists using your faith as a shield?
It's very difficult.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I don't follow the news about violence very closely, but every time I try to read something, I feel like I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met in the square of George of Poděbrady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims joined Christians in a demonstration against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disapprove of violence.
I don't think they should have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries, for example.
They're a little more religious than I am, so we have these sometimes pretty wild discussions about Islam, because we all have a little bit of a different understanding of it.
I'm from France, so I had a different education, they were maybe learning about Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of women.
How do you feel about it?
I don't feel like a subordinate in any way.
It's the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It's also related to the fact that you don't wear a head covering.
Like the hijab?
And it's mostly signed by the way I was raised.
My mom, for example, is a very fundamentalist Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she doesn't wear a headscarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to you to interpret it.
When one reads the Koran, one should make up his own mind about things.
So when I read the passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, I'm not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I go to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where they require a scarf, I'll wear it.
Do you plan to stay in Prague?
For now, yes.
I've never felt so good anywhere else.
I was thinking about Poland for a while, but Prague is great.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
I think Prague is the perfect city for that.
Czech Muslims joined Christians in demonstrating against violence.
The wind in Rio has hit the yacht Kozelska Fencla on the forecastle.
The Friday sea trips in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were made by the Czech yachtswoman Veronika Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth place before the final two races.
That would secure the Czech Republic's place in the final race.
You pick up packages like Pokemon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea of using already planned routes for the transport of shipments is the work of TV director Matej Liška and Prague music club manager Marek Greger.
With this idea, they have created a trio of applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national Transit app in May.
At this point, there are a thousand cities on it, and we're going to expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn it first, before we focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Carry app work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and sign up for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how big a package you can transport and how much you want for it.
Someone else might ask for a ride that day.
If the route and delivery time are both right, they'll pair up and both will receive a notification.
At that point, a chat will open up, and the two will discuss the handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to have a courier for every package?
I don't know the ideal situation, I can't estimate how many registrations and how many trips are needed to have the optimal coverage and each supply matching the demand.
It's already working on the main roads, and it's logically easier than, say, on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People also build trust and realize that no one is going to run away with the package.
You haven't had to solve a case like this before?
How many users does the service have two months after launch?
Right now, we have about five to six thousand people who are creating roads.
We consider this a success and we hope that more will follow.
Is there any chance the sender might be waiting too long?
We hope to compete with the big conglomerates just because we can deliver on the same day and at a fraction of the price.
With a big company, you pay a few thousand for two-hour delivery.
Here you pay a hundred or less because it's a route that someone is already taking.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope that's the case.
The market has huge potential, it's being fed by huge multinational carriers, as well as retail chains, where everyone started to shop around and gradually found that the quality didn't match what they were paying for.
Nobody wants to find a note in their mailbox telling them to pick up a shipment at the branch, and not before 7:00 p.m. that day.
I had been waiting for six hours for the package, and I was at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster, more functional service that won't annoy anyone and sends a signal to the competition to try.
The Commission has also adopted a communication on the implementation of the 'European Year of the Environment' (2007-2012).
Neither of them have ever worked in information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška works as a TV director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already scheduled routes between world metropolises, mainly by air, to transport parcels.
In 2015, they submitted a project to a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The application was developed over three quarters of the year and was launched in March 2016.
The Převezu app was started in December last year and released in May this year.
It's a local version of Shippansee, modified for the Czech market.
The Mesíkem and Mesíkem Profi applications were developed since January of this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention from the beginning was to make all of these applications that one day would be combined into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy is a hot topic these days, and this is a service like Airbnb or Uber.
Aren't you concerned about operating in an area that no one can say much about yet, where the boundaries of sharing and grey economy are?
It's the same, just a different product.
We know that if this is successful and we go up, we're going to be the next thorn in the side of the grey economy.
But while some people save and some people make money, there is no intention to circumvent the tax authorities and tax controls.
Any user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they can make a profit from it.
What makes you think the ministry has such great potential?
The sender saves money and the carrier earns money, or they reduce their travel costs.
There's a powerful idea that brings together the interests of both sides.
In an age of social media that divides people, we want this one to bring people together.
Good stories can come out of it, people are happy to help someone, and they'll tell stories about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People have been missing personal access for a long time, I think, and we call this app a people-to-people service.
How do you guarantee that the courier with the package won't get away?
Each user scans his ID card and provides a bank, debit or credit card number when registering.
These are the channels that give credibility to the service and to the person.
Couriers also collect stars based on the ratings of the senders.
We'll offer insurance, but we're still working out the details.
The courier is responsible for the unsecured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not assume criminal liability for the contents if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hash in a sealed package in his suitcase, the criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there any chance of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered data is accessible to the administrative authorities, who are the only ones who can see it, even if we are not able to see it ourselves. The data is protected against misuse.
How much money does the courier get after a successful delivery?
The courier sets the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged a few percent more for arranging the contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
And no one can blame a courier for not delivering a shipment when he actually delivered it, because the receipt and delivery are verified by QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether it's in relation to the size or the contents of the package?
You can move anything.
We have three sizes, small as a lump of butter, medium as a bowl of eggs, and large as a beer can.
After that, there are no more restrictions, and if someone has room in the car, they can bring a refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the ability to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don't even have to pack the thing unless you want to hide the contents outright.
You slip a forgotten hoodie into the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea, and how long did it take to launch the service?
A friend of mine had an idea more than two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention to it then.
Then he showed me a demo of a cross-national application that targets mainly airliners.
At that moment, I told him I wasn't looking for an investor, but I wanted to become one myself and put my savings into it.
The next year was spent developing the product, and to give it more credibility, we founded Shippansee LTD in London.
But this is not the version you're primarily focusing on right now.
No, we've focused our marketing on the Czech Republic, where we're trying to catch up with the app, because it's been a labor of love and there's still a lot to work on and improve.
We're trying to respond to customer feedback, and we're not dealing with the foreign market as much right now.
We know it's a long shot, but we're not worried, we want to make a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgrades.
The link was created when we thought that the domestic segment could be much more interesting and that in the Czech Republic we would at least learn it.
The third application of the Cluster is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the right address halfway around the world.
It works for the sender just like it does for the carrier, but the difference is that in it, as a courier, you see the shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
We've created an app for couriers who want to make a living from it, called Mess Profi.
So someone can make a decent living picking up parcels around town?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on maternity leave, someone who wants to cash in on a commute.
If they're all fooling around with Pokemon, they can collect this anyway.
You see where the orders are in the city, you go to it, you click and see when it has to be delivered, and you deliver the shipment.
It's set up cheaper than competing services.
We're also currently working on a web interface that will be critical for companies to send packages, fill in the data on the web, or create dots on the map.
We can then bill them for using the service every month.
Are you now working on the project full-time?
It's a pain in the ass, but we have it in our work to keep the project going.
We're not a powerful multinational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with more ideas and ideas.
Now we're looking for an investor strong enough to be able to take over not just the Czech market with us, but to go with us, with a passing of the ball, into a global product and become the next big player in the market like Airbnb and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring a forgotten variety.
That makes the second part, and the solo in it will be more varied than in Call of Duty, according to first reports.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of the network filling in the first part.
So you can look forward to the freedom of movement that includes running and the ability to use a fighting titan.
In addition to the action sequences, the game will feature levels geared specifically for agile movement.
They'll be like platform games and include puzzles.
So the double jump, wall running, and rope-sliding are essential to overcome them.
Sometimes, in addition, it will be necessary to eliminate the enemies.
There will also be maps of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to raise and lower the platforms and close the massive doors.
You'll be making the battlefield look like this.
The pace of the game should therefore oscillate between furious action and more relaxed moments of exploring an unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper the pawn, dreaming of a career as a pilot.
Early in the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimos crash-land on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy troops.
And not even the wildlife there will be kind to him.
And because Lastimosa is fatally injured in the crash, Cooper is tasked with bringing Captain Titan back to life.
His dream of becoming a pilot is coming true sooner than he expected.
But the first step is to steal the batteries necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's calls to the Titan will be significant.
They will serve as a source of information for players about the soldier's past, but at the same time, the robot's personalized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the Titan lists all the injuries that Cooper could sustain during a planned jump.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign was brought to us by the Polygon server.
The results will be available in two months and Bonusweb will give you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is out on October 28th for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand is revived, but the original publisher remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the measures in question were granted by the State.
This led to the release of Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection pack.
In addition, 23 other games are in development for the company, 13 of which have not been revealed.
Thirty years ago, when I was retiring, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a man 20 years younger than she, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - at first she was obviously trying for him for a long time, then they got together.
He's a big guy, probably her type, 'cause she dated a guy like that before me.
She was totally crazy about him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, it had this girly, in-love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I was watching the whole thing.
He regularly left work at 3:30 a.m., and she always left for shopping at 3:00 a.m.
Every day she tried to see him.
I later found out that they met at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there right now?
I got the keys, was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I always ended up sitting at home.
I never got to go in there, make that decision.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife was controlling my thoughts.
I think she soon found out that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just some old fart.
And the neighbors at the time, they were implying that he knew about it, too.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all went to shit, it would be bad.
Only the daughter knew that this would happen to everyone in the family.
So I've been putting it off, and putting it off, and putting it off.
But one day I went to his apartment to ask for help with something in the laundry room.
He went in with me, and I told him that I got an anonymous tip that he was meeting my wife, and that everything pointed to that.
I asked him what he had to say.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, stared at the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on her way to the store at that time.
I told her, but she didn't believe me.
She didn't react to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of guy who's never been anywhere much, who's having trouble getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I haven't even thought about divorce.
I always hoped that one day it would end.
I thought I'd forgive her for all of it and move on.
That's not what happened.
And I never really got over it.
I still have it in me.
I used to tell her that a lot, but I finally let it go.
He's still living in the house next door, and I'm still living with her.
It's just that she's more my wife than my housekeeper.
She did everything at home - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's a hard worker.
I think she always tried to give me no other reason to complain.
And she's kind, too, by the way.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't let me.
Meanwhile, we go out for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we're happily married.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she had me and she liked me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I'm tired of living like this.
Back when it started, and I was very bad at it, I once told her I didn't want to live and asked her what she'd say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree to this or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "There's plenty of room".
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
In the wake of the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists, with the government and the local Muslim minority calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public liberty, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion", said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only ministers educated in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where money often comes from jihad-infested preachers.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was established in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was already intended to help to make the financial flows between mosques and the countries that fund their construction more transparent.
But soon, it was beset by internal strife, and it never functioned properly.
"It is a total failure", Valls said.
The new foundation will be headed by former interior and defense minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are some 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of which are dedicated to radical Islam.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and several dozen more are considering the move.
This week, German police have also intervened against jihadist clerics.
The imams were allegedly recruiting fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015, a debate has raged in France over a new institution to replace the defunct foundation.
All of this has precipitated further terrorist attacks by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to provide domestic funding for mosques and also to oversee imams.
However, it is not yet clear where the funding will come from, although several proposals are under consideration.
One of them is the special fee for halal food, i.e. mainly meat from slaughtered animals according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the sellers of halal food, in exchange for the granting of a licence.
Some of the money would then go directly to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of between 10 and 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims going to Mecca.
Every year, some 30,000 are produced in France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only ministers who have completed university training programs should be allowed to preach in French mosques.
This would make their preaching consistent with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have arrested 20 of them since December and more will follow", said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"France has no place for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men", he said.
Zaragoza. What is it?
His ex-wife was seriously wounded by an unknown gunman early Friday morning at a shopping mall in Zaragoza, northern Spain, reports the Independent.
The shooting occurred after the woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the mall, where he also started shooting.
Witnesses say the man then turned the gun on himself, reports the Independent.
The woman was driven to the hospital by her uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to be called to pick up the man in critical condition.
The incident occurred at around 11 a.m. in the central part of the Aragonese capital, not far from the local university.
Citing the Spanish news agency Europa Press, the Independent said the motive was likely the couple's recent, unresolved divorce.
The garlic rolls, the wakame with the algae, the ginger and the chili sauce.
Summer is about light, easily digestible food, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our appetites and our heads.
And so from the summer gardens comes the smell of grilled garlic, of the larks, of the pork knuckles.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, still occasionally except for salad or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecuing saves time and dishes, and it is a social activity, and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other ways to enjoy a special meal that requires little ritual to prepare, but that does not require long boiling, baking, frying, or steaming.
And they're good for our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where the quality ingredients and a few well-honed griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a truly exotic delicacy.
As are the even easier rice paper rolls from today's recipe.
It even eliminates the more time-consuming cooking and cooling of the rice.
The paper can be soaked in water for a moment, and then it's up to the cook's imagination to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no such thing as algae.
The advantage of many Asian dishes today is that the ingredients are usually readily available.
Including a loaded sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the staple treats that accompany sushi or fresh rolls.
You can make it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy flavor and delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe that mixes several types of vinegar and ginger.
So, buy a bag of the right size, and the supplement with proven antibacterial properties, digestive properties, and resistance to cough and flu is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used especially in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate dishes in various ceremonies and rituals.
The long, ribbed leaves of the banana plant are also very common in many Asian and South American countries as an "aid" for preparing various baked, boiled and fried dishes, which are packaged in them similar to alobal.
The banana leaf also adds a distinctive flavor to the dish.
Here, you can buy them in exotic fruit and vegetable stores, even if they're pre-cut into a round shape.
However, choose only leaves that are green and healthy - not cracked or stained.
Similarly, the preparation of a salad made from wakame, sesame, and sesame oil is easy.
You can buy it frozen.
If you frequently eat or prepare sushi, you may be familiar with nori.
In Japan, one of the most important species of seaweed is harvested, pressed, and dried to make nori leaves - slices for making sushi.
Wakame, a dark green alga found in waters around Hokkaido, is eaten fresh and dried and is as popular as nori.
By the way, for those of you who don't know wakame miso soup, it's said that Asian women use it to help recover from childbirth.
And this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It purifies the blood, strengthens circulation, even supposedly prevents hair from turning gray, and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and ground wakame is also used as a spice, such as in rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to hatch in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water, and boiled for half a minute.
Then they're cooled in ice water, cut out the middle ribs, and continue to be processed, like a favorite salad.
Of course, buying it ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all that's left is to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a little bombshell of longevity.
If you can resist and not throw in an extra grilled stick.
Eat healthy, light and easy.
Asians know how to do it.
With a few special ingredients and a little ingenuity, you have an interesting, fresh dish that deliciously combines flavours.
And that's it.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green beans, 60 g of pickles, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First we'll get the scrolls ready.
We'll soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we'll take it out and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, we boil the sprouts in hot water for a short time, and after about three minutes, we cool them quickly in ice water so that they do not lose their color.
We put a vegetable filling on the permitted paper and wrap it.
The filling is made of white radish, carrots and lettuce cucumbers, which are cut into thin noodles, mixed with sweet chili sauce, added to chopped coriander, mixed thoroughly and put on rice paper.
We put the pineapple shoots on the banana leaf, add the twigs, and then we finish the whole dish with wakame algae, garlic, a slice of mango, black sesame, and a few pine nuts.
Great Britain must settle for silver in rugby sevens, Fiji's selection takes gold
Britain's impressive seven-a-side performance ended in a crushing final stop, as Fiji beat the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio by a resounding 43 to 7.
The Fijians have shown a master class in handling, throwing, evasion, supporting, line running and brute force - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with a priceless consolation in the form of a silver medal - Britain's third on the day - and the Brits could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic rugby sevens tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
An upset win over South Africa 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day may have frozen them in the final.
But Fiji in their form would beat a 15-man team in full health.
No, it's not going to be a consolation for the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost one.
This defeat may be painful, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji started out magnificently, the British intruders bouncing back in delight.
For captain Tom Mitchell and the rest of the team, it was like running behind a row of moving buses and the World Cup champions were leading 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The clock was ticking down to four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another right-wing down, from which it was a conversion.
It's 12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third time, but only slowed the Fijians.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another after his return and the clock still had more than 1 minute left... of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then broke through the small British and came to the line, where he scored.
The conversion to a 29:0 state was followed by a pause.
It was as if Fiji had been born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning the pass.
That's just the way it is.
The British made a massive half-time change and stopped the Fijian offense for four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova's brilliant fielder made a breakthrough.
Dan Norton tried to get the British a chance, throwing a touchdown to the left corner to raise the score to 367. But the game had long been won by the Pacific Islanders, and their fans on the field were singing, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the Fijian's absolutely cheerful attitude.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the victory of the Fijians with another attempt.
The whistle blew, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the grass, utterly dejected.
Earlier that day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and the United Kingdom beat South Africa in a close semi-final - by one conference.
Kyle Brown put the South Africans in the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, with his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half from under the hook.
A brilliant late pitch from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony's England XV, secured the victory - and eventually the silver medal.
Glover and Heather Stanning's victory in the rowing race was inspired by the coach's battle with cancer.
You won't find a more emotional gold in these Games - and that's a fact.
From the first shot to the last, in 220 punishing historical breaths, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though there were two people on the raft, there were three voices on the boat, and as the boat whizzled across the water to meet their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, they were joined on board by the still-present voice of coach Robin Williams, the first women in British sport history to achieve this.
Their dominance was absolute, their 39th race in total, in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two superb athletes, flying across the water with the grace of a swan - does not reflect the nature of victory fully.
Behind every gold medal in rowing is a battalion of helping hands that, little by little, make a difference, and no hand has been more helpful than the hand of a coach who, 30 months ago, didn't know if he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and I had this operation.
Without the surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It'll change your perspective a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately for the trio, he was able to begin treatment in early 2014, during the off-season, to minimize the downtime, if that's what you can call it under the circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get my shit together fast.
That was a trigger.
I was in the hospital, and I was walking around the room -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual, trying to manage his own anxiety.
Stanning, a Royal Artillery Regiment captain who has been on a mission in Afghanistan, said: 'I've been emotionally drained this week, maybe a little extreme, but it means so much.'
It just goes to show me how much this means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin has worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin so far.
We wouldn't be anybody without Robin, so he's got a lot of credit, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better trainer, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The duo set a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish crews started to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were focused at the moment.
Helen was screaming, "Don't stop, don't stop", and I was like, "Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, but we didn't want to achieve anything big.
We weren't looking forward to the fireworks tonight, we just wanted to paddle well, go out and win the race, and we did.
The couple will take a year to think it over before deciding what to do next.
Glover's getting married next week, and her replacement is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It makes me feel a lot better, she said.

The prison?
"They should be free riders", says the taxicab-hunter Rubeš to the groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former Prague magistrate's clerk are, according to ČT, the defendants.
You've done a series of reports exposing fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that's going to be tried.
You've had some unpleasant run-ins with outsiders over it.
How groundbreaking is the news of the indictment of members of the organized group?
I was expecting some kind of court case.
I'm more interested in the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
They should return all the stolen money.
And they should give it back by giving all the people free rides.
That's a rather odd solution.
Does this mean that you do not consider the punishment effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so scared they don't do the job anymore.
Like, one of them is a pinball machine, the other one is a pizza delivery guy, and one of them is a total freak.
The defendants could theoretically face two to eight years in prison.
Is that an adequate rate?
I have a problem with the deprivation of liberty in general.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in this case, is pointless.
People like that should give back to the company what they've taken from it.
For a quarter of a century, they have been doing what they do, destroying our country's name and robbing the people.
Now let them make a good business card and give people free rides.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would function as a public service.
Like someone who goes to pick up trash, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole eventually and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at the University of Tomáš Báth in Zlín.
He's one of the people who started viral videos and web videos in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, now preparing the Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In short reports, Rubeš advises them on which services in Prague to avoid and which to use without fear.
He previously directed the series How to Do It, City of Deception, Life in Luxury, Enough Is Enough and Prague vs. Prague.
The indictment refers to them as an organized group.
The police had been following her for months.
Is it possible to call a network of taxi fraudsters a mafia?
They're cute mobsters, not the kind we know from The Godfather.
It's more like a mob, junior, but organized, I'm sure.
Just that they're watching each other's backs.
The whole of Prague is divided up.
I noticed that the main train station doesn't like Paris, and Paris doesn't like taxi drivers waiting at the Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Each one just keeps their own place, and each group is organized in some way.
It's obviously a complex network.
But the defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver about the checkpoints.
As you say, the unwelcome phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
What percentage of Prague's taxi-hacker fraud do you think is at stake?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst are still on the street.
I'm talking about Aleš Ryjak, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at Charles Bridge and drives people.
Last time I rode with him, he asked me for 700 for three kilometers.
The police didn't arrest him for some reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people is therefore unlikely to wipe out the already famous Prague riot, which is apparently much larger in scope.
It's not for nothing, of course.
It helps, but it doesn't erase all evil, that's true.
Do the cab drivers who rob foreign tourists always show up in the same places you showed in the reports, Charles Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They're in these locations every day, and every day they're violating the ordinances.
It's ignored by the city police and the Prague Magistracy.
It's not even cat-like anymore, but utterly indifferent.
The business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if only a part of the group, will be brought to justice.
This is a breakthrough.
So I have to ask, do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve downtown Prague.
And even if I feel like it's a little bit better, I'm going to keep doing it.
We need to push on the door from the other side.
Even if there's one thief left, we should still do something to take him out.
You can't just sit there.
But it's not like that, there's more of them, of course.
You still trying to confront them in the cabs?
I do test drives sometimes, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, from the same group, by the way, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for the three kilometers, although he later claimed that it was 56 crowns (he used a decimal trick).
He had a receipt for it, the police came and this taxi driver was so cute and impudent that he even went to the police and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver had a decimal on the meter and robbed the tourists of 357 crowns.
Can we say that the insolence of the crooked cabbies has not diminished even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged absurd sums for a short ride?
Their audacity is still unbelievable.
What happened to the cabbie who demanded $25?
The cops sent him away, saying they couldn't discuss him on the spot because he had a receipt.
And I think that's going to be a problem with this trial as well.
On one side there'll be some cab driver with his tickets, on the other side the police.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate cannot use the secret recordings from the taxi cab as evidence in court.
When I was filming episodes about their cheating, the cab drivers themselves brought this precedent to my attention.
I've always wanted to use the footage for my reportage.
Are you concerned that this fact might protect them from a trial?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns a kilometer because he wouldn't make a living doing so.
You mentioned the decimal-bar trick that underwater taxi drivers use to get foreign clients.
Is it still current, or are they afraid to use this trick again after your reporting is published?
I think we popularized this trick by airing the show instead.
I was riding with a cab driver the other day, and he was bragging to me that he was the honest cab driver.
Then I noticed a black cardboard sticker on the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what he had in it, he said, "You know what it is".
If taxi-traffic tickets have not worked for taxi-drivers, can the court give them a warning to their colleagues?
Is there anything that can deter them from cheating?
You were talking about how you think they always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can stop them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are the fair taxi drivers who should be fighting harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the honest taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately the majority.
But do they have the appetite to go against those who tarnish the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they lack the mind.
They don't know much about it and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to the proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnačová), it was not very clear what they actually wanted.
They said they weren't protesting against Uber, they just wanted the same terms as Uber, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It just happened to block Prague, and it just became the best possible ad for Uber.
How do you assess the Prague City Hall's approach to the problem of overcharging?
It's obvious that the criminal police had to step in to solve something.
The magistrate was short-handed.
They had a mole who was leaking information, which means that the taxi department has been doing its job for years for nothing.
I hope they charge the clerk for every check that's been missed until the last check, so he realizes what he's done.
That's the worst part of it.
I even went on a test drive with him, which I only found out from their schedule.
It's been several months since the last installment of the series was published.
What's the response?
I mean, especially with the foreign audience, which is what the show is really about.
Whenever I have friends from overseas, I always show them the videos.
And then when we walk around the Old Town Square, they're surprised that the same people that they see in the footage are actually standing there.
The infamous Prague celebrities.
I mean it.
I'd put a stick around them for people to look at.
The Communist Museum right down the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need one?
I'll take it from here.
I'm using a service where I don't have to pay cash, but I can pay by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there's no possibility of fraud.
But there are many dispatchers that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street once since.
When I got in the car, the driver said, "Yeah, you got some nerve".
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported as early as 2005.
The former mayor Pavel Bém went on a check-in tour in the same year, disguised as an Italian tourist, and on the first attempt the driver cheated him by two hundred.
But editor Rubeš has had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for the ride from the Old Town Hall to Wenceslas Square, which comes to about 195 crowns per kilometer, as the report's creators calculated.
The Prague City Hall had set the maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometer.
The film also shows other surprising amounts: For example, a two-kilometer road from the street Parish to Truhlářská cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by the taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
For a ride on the Angel, which is a mile and a half, they charge as much as 600 crowns.
Marble is washed with mostly pure water, as much as possible without chemicals, and the longer, the better.
The dirt comes out well, though occasionally the dirt has to be scalpelled down, peeled out of the folds.
It's not easy and it's not quick, says Vanessa Trost, a restaurateur from Oldrich in The Hague.
Hat down in front of her: the tomb is covered with scaffolding, which must be climbed and descended countless times.
"The restorer should be careful, patient, and unpretentious about the work environment", she said.
This is far from her first restoration work on Frýdlantsk.
Thanks to her, restorations were carried out, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the rear of the town hall of Frýdlant, she also restored the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Pieta in Frýdlant Okružná Street, the Marian column in Frýdlant or the atlanta in the front of the spa in the New Town under Smrk.
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine of Redernu began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of impurities and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; they will either be anchored to the wall or to each other.
It is also expected to be treated and preserved.
The tombstone is being re-lit.
"Then we will begin by aligning the inscriptions on marble slabs with gold plates", said Věra Sobotová, the State Monument Protection Officer of the Municipal Office in Frýdlant.
There is no record of the tomb having undergone any repairs in the past.
A closer look reveals the holes carved in the marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old, and they're the remains of a tombstone.
It was richly decorated, but unfortunately, after the Swedish invasion in the Thirty Years' War, it all disappeared.
They literally combed the tombstone, Sobotka noted.
The Church of the Holy Cross has a small-time restoration team.
After the flood in 2010, the tombstones that were under water had to be put in order, the baptistery, the murals in the tomb and now the tombstone had to be restored.
"We would like to go into stained glass in the future", Sobotova said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, and we put in money every year for maintenance and repairs.
The restoration work on the Redernov Tomb will cost a total of 128,000 crowns.
They'll be paid for by the grant, the city won't put any of its money into this part of the renovation.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from the prize in the regional round of the Historic City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, said the mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The decision to release the prize money for the restoration of the tombstone was made by the city council.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets tracked by means of indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one month and a half years.
Markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The S&P 500, which was down 12 percent in February, is now at a new all-time high and has gained 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks in the long run, which have always gotten their way in the end.
With US stocks at an all-time high, volatility is once again disappearing, currently at its lowest level since 2014, when markets were rising calmly and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the US central bank and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below the 12 percent threshold.
And also not to.
While the Fed continues to prepare markets for gradual rate hikes, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England added its hand to the mix, buying £70 billion of bonds over the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing is thus pushing already low yields even lower and contributing to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this last?
That, of course, is the million dollar question.
But there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is experiencing almost constant growth with no major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilizing and Brexit is basically no longer an issue, so we should not be too surprised if the US stocks continue in a similarly calm regime.
It's a pity Juncker doesn't have a Klaus class!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician to do this difficult job, said the European Commission President, Juncker, when he appointed a French politician (a really experienced politician, because he is so well-versed in all sorts of transnational political functions that we could hardly find a better example of the so-called European elites) as the European Commission's main negotiator on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
Juncker's choice has dashed hopes that the EU has a serious interest in seeking forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a European federalist.
They hate Britain.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He understood it as only he could understand it: the bitter enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The Multilateralist was the co-author of the concept of the Banking Union and, with a loathing for anything that came from the City of London financial centre, he pushed through legislation that was too tight on financial sector and services regulation.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, uncompromising and probably even reckless negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
In this context, how can we not remember the peaceful and amicable division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which so much contributed the prudence, foresight and ability of empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
That is why today the Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this respect.
It would be for the good of all!
The earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin ruler has fired his close friend Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday dismissed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno.
The Russian media reported this, citing a press release from the Kremlin.
Putin, however, indicated that Ivanov was being released at his own request.
In a meeting broadcast by Rossija 24, the president said he was responding to Ivanov's wishes, which he had expressed when he took office, to be chief of staff for four years at the most.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the change in the leadership of the presidential administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current deputy Vayno, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is considered one of Putin's closest associates.
Former KGB officer, who has held positions such as Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He's now leaving the chair of the President's Security Council.
But Ivanov told Putin that he had been in charge of the administration for a record long time.
He stayed there for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already taken over the post.
Kvitova and the fat girls, Uncle and Shafarova, will not play the final.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches have turned into finals.
Petra Kvitova lost her first match, to Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig after 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6 sets.
Kvitova was followed by the Czech deblistka Šafářivá with Unclecová.
The Williams sisters' winning runs in the first set, but they missed two, and the Russians eventually scored in the shortened game.
They lost the second set 4-6.
The Czech rower had a semi-successful morning in Rio: skipper Ondřej Synek won his semi-final with a margin of victory, beating the other Croatian, Damir Martin, by almost a second despite the slow finish.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind has calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, Sonek said.
His rivals, unlike him, had to fight for promotion.
So they've had some strength, but it might be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing into my hand, said Prague rower Dukly.
But Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not follow in the footsteps of Snyk.
The 35-year-old rower finished fourth in today's semi-final and will compete in the B final on Saturday for seventh to 12th place.
London's gold is not so cheap.
It's the first time I've missed the finals at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry about that, but on the other hand, I was driving a quality race and I gave it my all.
The rivals were just better, and Topink Knapková was bowing to them.
She fought to the end, believing she would make it to the top six in her fourth game.
The fight was stopped just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were level, that anyone could step up from that field.
I was surprised to see a Chinese woman with a finish like that.
And I thought I could get through the Austrian to make it to the final.
Unfortunately, today was the race of a lifetime, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio was the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who for the second time failed to break through the qualification, this time with a small injury in the leg.
Nechalpey took 33rd place in the competition.
The Russians were the best qualifiers.
Sergei Kamensky was the first with 629 points, and Kirill Grigoryan was the second with 628.9.
Nephew's shot was worth 620.5 points.
The program in Rio was also addressed for the first time by athletes, among them the Czech seventh-division athletes Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
The Czech team is ranked 11th in the second Olympic discipline, while the Czech record holder, Eliška Klučinová, is 22nd.
The British woman, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, is leading the way, with a jump of 6 feet 4 inches (198 cm) as well as the second Belgian woman, Nafissatou Thiam.
Both of them have taken care of the highest altitude performance in the history of the heptathlon.
They tried to jump another six feet, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
To put aside the absurdity of the question asked in this way, German society has gone through a deep self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In both of the great Eurasian nations, dictatorships and regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible came to power in the 20th century.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether through daily individual repression, targeted starvation, incompetent war management, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumaneally exterminated about six million Jews, and the total casualties of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, atrocities were committed by both Germans and Soviets.
In Germany and in the USSR, not just a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively, or just by cowardice or by hiding their heads in the sand.
It's not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, immediately after the end of the war came the denazification, the Nuremberg trials.
But the most important came later.
As the children grew older, they began to ask: "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?"
How could you do that?
It brought real reflection and healing to the society.
Until recently, the German elites were concerned primarily with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they are certainly not about re-attaching Alsace-Lorraine or attacking someone - in retaliation - militarily - that everyone will admit.
After losing the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive change closed for good at the turn of the millennium, when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often, a criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Putin's Russia's policy is revenge, conquering lost territories, humiliating the West.
The health, prosperity and future of his own people are of no value to the overseer.
Strike your own, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only through decades of despotic rule that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - predisposed to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the growing tensions over Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, there has been a deterioration of the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region.
Who benefits from increased tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The Ukrainian side replaced the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
The reports from the two adversaries are obviously contradictory and difficult to verify independently, so we can only ponder the old familiar question of who benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which of course Ukraine denies and instead accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
The response to the information about the arrest of members of the Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia came from the case of the pilot Savchenko, who was allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we were to go along with the Ukrainian version, what would Russia gain from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and intensifying the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a shift in attention away from the situation in Ukraine, against the background of the immigration crisis in Europe.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credibility with its people, with the current support for President Poroshenko hovering around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have been bankrupt long ago if it weren't for the generous financial injections from the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to once again strongly draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation with voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces want to show themselves once again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to Great Russia.
We can only hope that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both hostile sides and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero figure since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The Commission notes that the increase in the number of employees in the Union is due to the increase in the number of employees in the Union.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not provided any information on the number of sampled Union producers.
The Commission therefore concluded that the measures in force were in breach of the Union interest.
The Commission also notes that the increase in the number of passengers was due to the increase in the number of flights to the airport.
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and household maintenance (0.5%), and health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
US intelligence has been tracking Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about Russian attacks became public last month when the FBI announced it was investigating an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party's headquarters.
But there is no official report of Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
The report on the alleged Russian attack was top secret because it would reveal that the US intelligence services were monitoring the hacking attack and could reveal how they were doing it and what resources they were using.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack.
The new Cybersecurity Advisory Board is to be established by the European Commission.
The Russian trace material was encrypted and only accessed by a small group of experts, Reuters reported.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the Gang of Eight in the United States, were informed.
It is made up of the heads of both houses Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democratic chairmen of both houses Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the House Armed Services and Security Committees.
Democratic Party acting head Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she is forming a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-rate protection of Democratic Party servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Alberta.
The chain apologized.
Based on the suggestion of the consumer to health problems after the consumption of food Wild salmon smoked - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016 Prague hygienists carried out inspection in the stores Albert on Wenceslas Square and Na Mostku.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with an expiry date of 22.11.2016 that the customer had notified was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with an expiry date of 11.12.2016, was withdrawn.
The presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex has been confirmed by laboratory examination.
It's a parasitic worm from the digestive tract of marine mammals.
The larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a potent allergen, and live larvae ingested by humans can penetrate the stomach wall into the internal organs, Sticha said.
We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience this brand of product has caused.
We immediately withdrew that batch and for precautionary reasons, we withdrew all other batches of this item.
"There was a mistake on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves", spokesman Alberto Barbora Vanko told Novink.
If a customer has purchased this product, they can return it to any of the chain's stores and get their money back.
Larvae will be destroyed by freezing and adequate heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vrnata.
The presence of a dangerous product was reported to the health authorities of the Prague and Central Bohemia veterinary authorities.
According to the website safetyfood.cz, people can become ill with anisakiasis after ingesting the parasite, which can manifest itself as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea, or the disease can go without symptoms, the CDC said.
Symptoms occur one to two weeks after eating undercooked infected fish.
After three weeks of the onset of the disease, the larvae usually leave the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously.
Both the adult worms and the larvae are sensitive to high and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficiently heating the fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinary experts have also recently tested salmon on the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three out of the five samples tested had the parasite in them.
A shipment of 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Shipped, in the absolute majority to the Ahold chain, there were 919 packages to date.
The company is currently withdrawing unsold product stocks from retailers, CTC spokesman SVS Petr Pejchal said on Friday.
The veterinarians immediately banned the shipment of any more products from the warehouse after finding positive samples.
A 17-year-old British girl trying to escape from Rakka, killed by a Russian air strike.
After an initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was killed, a sobering moment came.
The Caliphate's expected paradise for British girls was turned into an earthly hell from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halima, according to relatives.
She called her repeatedly in Britain, confiding that she wanted to come home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders to fire indiscriminately, The Telegraph quotes the family lawyer of the deceased girl, Tasnima Akunjee.
The last trace led to Rakka, where the girl was last heard from.
Then came the report of her death, which cannot be verified.
Her family was communicating from an apartment in east London.
They discussed how she could get out of Rakka and across the Turkish border.
There they hoped to reunite with their former student.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, as the house she was staying in had been hit by a bomb in May, according to Britain's ITV News.
The TV added that the bomb was probably dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You would pay a fortune to get your child out of the danger zone, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) was thinking about escaping from the territory of the Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and according to the information available she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she took it as a warning and decided not to take the risk, BBC Akunjee said.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set off on a trip on February 17 last year.
All the family said was they were going out.
But they were headed to Gatwick Airport and out through Turkey into IS-held territory.
According to the girl's lawyer, the family did everything in their power to get back Kadiz.
You would pay the price to get your child out of harm's way, and this family did everything they could, all the work they could, to get their daughter home.
But they couldn't do it without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he says, is that the fate of Kadisha can serve as a deterrent case for other girls and even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people have gone there, realised how things are there, understood how different it is from the propaganda promises of the Islamic State, and wanted to return", Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they've also been silenced, their families have to come to terms with the fact that they're most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was the county seat and the seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the mid-18th century, the town hall has housed the courts and the basement below the hall has served as the local prison.
Conditions in which the prisoners were held were miserable, and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them successfully.
That's why the city officials decided to move the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more convivial, with heating and gas lighting.
However, it was not in operation for long, being closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, as the smaller correctional facilities were expensive to operate and not very profitable.
Tales of convicts and ghost hunts.
Open to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
The guides in period costumes enhance the authenticity of the experience.
There is also a torture chamber where visitors can learn about the forms of punishment inflicted on criminals, whether it was finger-breaking or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists may be locked in one of the cells, usually for a memorial photograph or to evoke the feeling of being behind bars.
Inveraray Prison is also one of Scotland's most famous allegedly haunted locations.
Several groups of ghost hunters have gone there, and to this day, the museum allows people to come and hunt for ghosts.
But a night like this will cost £300, which is about $1,500.
Besides being a popular tourist attraction, the city also offers great food, scenic views, and history.
The anime effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows some 150 million users every day to alter reality and tamper with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a character that looks like it came out of a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate over 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
Any mistakes will be immediately reported.
Snapchat's filters have in the past drawn criticism with accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it offered users this week a filter that made their eyes squint, their teeth crooked, and their faces puffy, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface".
And they asked if these recurring issues point to a larger societal problem -- a diversity problem.
The Verge and Motherboard reported on Wednesday, and the news and outrage spread quickly, with Snapchat reporting the feature was canceled the next day.
The company offered an explanation: Filter was intended as a showcase for the characters in the anime, not as a cartoon for Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of the painful stereotypes in action.
The others, without the wrapping, rejected the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was at the very least harmful and embarrassing.
She added that it's hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about yellowface, but that yellowface is being pushed to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless battle for diversity and inclusion, from the boardrooms of corporations to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the sheer number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
"When a Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some users", said Katie Zhu, 25, in an interview Thursday, "it's very difficult to go unnoticed like it used to be".
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and urged others to do the same.
In a Medium post and phone interview, she said she believes racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring process.
Katie Zhu criticized the predominantly white, all-male leadership of the company and ended the article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they don't have any diversity and colored people in their workforce at the time when these things are being decided", said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American descent, "or there are colored people working, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to talk".
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not disclose figures concerning the diversity of its employees, having the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees, but a company spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhuova adds: I wonder if they really need more users like this who can say it's not okay, while their account remains deleted.
Army officers misrepresented intelligence on IS, says parliamentary committee
A parliamentary committee report released Thursday said that officers from the United States Central Command had altered intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than was being provided by events on the ground.
According to a preliminary report by a task force assembled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Intelligence analysts that their superiors had altered their assessment of the American effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release to the report states: Intelligence outputs approved by Centcom senior officers typically offered a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than was confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our warriors are being harmed when a flawed analysis is presented to senior policymakers", said Ken Calvert, a California Republican and congressman.
The failure of Centcom's leadership stretches to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems the Central Command had in describing and analyzing the US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While offering no conclusive evidence that senior members of the Obama administration ordered the reports to be altered, the report says that analysts were under the impression that they were being pressured by Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
In the first half of 2015, many Central Staff press releases, statements and congressional testimony were substantially more positive than the events in reality, the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military offensive to take Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is clear after months of investigation", Congressman Mike Pompeo, the Republican representative from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence officers of the US Central Command manipulated the intelligence outputs of the Central Command in order to downplay the dangers of IS in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence related to the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday must be followed by further investigation and a more detailed examination.
There is another investigation underway in the intelligence services of Centcom, led by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense.
The Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom developed a very tight process to compile assessments of information about IS and Iraqi security forces", said Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Committee, in a statement.
According to Adam Schiff, the process 'lead to misrepresentation of intelligence outputs, damaged analysts' morale and 'failed to take into account dissenting opinions'.
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim they have found no evidence that the White House attempted to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions based on "precedent or political circumstances".
Preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the House report because the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
However, he stated that experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these crucial national security issues.
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing of Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim now claimed by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's allegations raised questions about the degree to which President Obama can rely on the Central Command to honestly evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other hot spots.
Intelligence criticism of the Islamic State has mirrored conflicts for over a decade, with the CIA analyst Gregory Hooker writing a research paper arguing that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - advocated a small unit in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance against the intelligence services of the Islamic State.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes against the Islamic State's refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group's financial resources, as the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not passed on outside the central staff.
The commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony to be too favorable to the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in Centcom by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. won their fourth straight game in ice hockey, so the deciding match will be played today against the Great Britain team.
Katie Bam scored three goals against Japan in a 6-1 win, and just a day later scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team in a 3-0 win over India on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever achieved anything like that.
"I have no idea", she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their entries.
But they know this: the Americans in the Olympic tournament lead the games 4-0 and share first place in the group with Great Britain, who remain undefeated in the quarter-finals after beating Japan 2-0.
Great Britain and the United States will face off on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarterfinals, and the match will decide who of the six teams will finish first and who will finish second.
The first-place team will be a little longer to avoid the strong Danes, who are leading the second group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the Americans have created a stir here with their surprise run, four years after finishing among the 12 teams in the London games.
Bam was on that team.
Raised in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, she first took up field hockey when she was 3 years old (her older twin sister played in Drexel) and made the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when she and her team members weren't doing so well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change", said Bam.
We didn't have the work rate we have today in London.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half with a shot from close range.
India entered the match without a tournament win, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held it 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She slipped down the left side of the field, then clicked through to the center and hit the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final home run in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had helped score a goal in each of the three victories, was the first of its kind in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now", said Parnham, "but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's match.
Zen trampolines in the midst of the Olympic frenzy
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning relay stick, handed down from the athlete to the swimmer, the gymnast, and the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of the dimpled-face women, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names ring in the household in prime time between commercials and sponsors' spots if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in the springboard.
The Olympic flame doesn't shine the same way at every event.
Away from the center, a little bit in the shadows are sports that are not universally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have success in the classic swimming style - and it'll probably reign for a long time.
But if I may name my particular favorite, let me draw your attention to the unobtrusive charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first introduced at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of interventions, it has remained almost unnoticed - many people I've questioned didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional apathy.
The U.S. has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012, none of its athletes even made it to the finals.
Prices in the male category are usually split between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year's gold medalists will be Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada.
But trampolining has another disadvantage, in part because to the untrained ear, it will seem more like a clown college than an Olympics.
I must confess I'm not an expert, but just an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential -- the comic vibration of endless reflection -- but it also has the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine in one.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "trampoline", which means "skateboard".
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline that shoots them to a height of nearly 30 feet [10 m], and they perform sets of several elements (saltoes, drills, and combinations) before finally landing back on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are graded on performance, difficulty and "going in the air".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries will compete in Rio, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual Olympic track trajectory is ahead.
The gold medal fighters must go further, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only to the finish line or the starting wall but, as the television news reports, to another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This united effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I also think it's kind of exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
Trampolining provides relief in this regard.
The trajectory of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
The point is not moving forward.
He or she reflects, as if in a weightless state like an astronaut, flying up, then down, then back up again effortlessly.
It's not without competition and, of course, without difficulty, but there's no fierce struggle to reach the goal, no measuring of distance, but only a perfect, neat alignment of time and gravity.
This is as close as the Olympics and Zen are gonna get.
The women's qualifying and finals take place on Friday afternoon at 1 pm Eastern Time, followed by the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will air the finale as part of the afternoon block, which begins at 2 p.m. both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a calm, pleasant moment that you'll probably overlook in all the other fights.
And if attention is to be gained only by making male athletes the objects of romantic glances and physical appearance - as recently suggested by U.S. gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
Protesting generation in Ethiopia, longtime ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it's been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, the country has been gripped by anti-government riots that have spread to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response has been merciless.
Witnesses say police officers shot and killed a crowd of unarmed protesters.
Video footage of the protests, which likely dates back to late last year or early this year, shows security forces beating young people with sticks after they were forced to stand on their hands against a wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a full investigation.
'It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even harder to make a step forward,' said Rashid Abdi, Head of the Horn of Africa Project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to remove the threat of terrorist attack in the region, particularly Somalia, and few, if any, African countries are receiving such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has been developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has been improved dramatically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And city streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be called a model of democracy - human rights organizations have been relentlessly talking about government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were expelled, imprisoned, killed, or exiled far into the wilderness.
But that can change.
"When you strangle people and they have no choice but to protest, there is a breakthrough", said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the youth will protest.
A whole generation is protesting.
The grievances are many and range from land disputes to absolute control of power by the ruling coalition.
After last year's widely criticized election, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition-held seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, the border with Eritrea is under increasing pressure, with conflict along this ill-defined, disputed border claiming hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to take advantage of the confusion and rearm.
There are several factors that explain why, after years of hiding beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have now flared up again.
The first of these is the seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate via social networks only in the last few years, when cheaper smartphones became commonly available and internet service provision improved.
And even when the government blocks access to Facebook or Twitter, as is common during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide the location of those people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromos and the Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Orom and the Amhar are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amharas, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce and exploited the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on the way to a unified leadership", said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oromo people.
The largest protests were in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amhars and Oromos believe Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and control the military, intelligence services, business, and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Melez Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an unspecified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see beyond the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting early signs of discontent and using envoys to manipulate and win over opponents.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge", said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was brought out of relative obscurity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who was from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he has no faith in the security services controlled by the Tigrayans.
Many fear that more bloodshed will result.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said were elections that the government had rigged and then stolen.
A crackdown followed, with many protesters killed - although fewer than in previous months - and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But it's clear that the growing discord within the Ethiopian government hasn't stopped it.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara town of Gondar attacked Tigrayan-owned businesses, and anti-Tigrayan hatred on social media is becoming more common.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently announced that the base was closed.
While the West wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile area.
"That", said Abdi, "is the very sharp edge of a blade".
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and ISIS funding as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to downplay the latest controversy flooding his campaign by saying he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak clearly to the American public.
It also puts his supporters, who have defended him vigorously in a turbulent time, in a difficult position to explain that he may not have meant what he said.
After this proposal at the Wednesday night meeting, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he did not really intend to say that the president and Hillary Clinton created IS.
However, in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was only being sarcastic.
The post was a reversal of a previous one-day statement in which Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump tone down his remarks by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump has tried to refocus his campaign on the economy while his polling preferences are dropping.
Trump and Clinton this week engaged in a duel in Michigan over economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, saying that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, after he had been criticised for suggesting that the Russians should hack into Clinton's emails, he later explained his comment by saying: "I'm being sarcastic, of course".
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and soften them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing how well certain messages are received by his supporters, to see how they react, and then, based on the reaction, give an explanation one way or another", said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who has tracked the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's very skillful in his statements and he knows that they're vague enough to be explained in a variety of ways.
As the polls continue to fall in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more divisive tone in recent days, rather than making things easier for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed that Tump is a long way behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump has tried to avoid apologizing for his provocative statements, but he has often accused his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, who must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is a legitimate political comment", Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little-known, small organization, which he called, quite wrongly, a rookie, and it came about because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, with Clinton as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to flourish and failed to take the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday's rally in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to fire the media around him on Twitter for trashing his every word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the poor, pathetic TV pundits who tried to understand him and said, "They can't do it!"
A few Democrats have taken Trump's apology as further proof that he's unfit for the presidency.
They've taken the coffee shop off the market, and now they're going back to Greenpoint.
The Verb Cafe was a dingy place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, no Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is looted and Verb is now a soap shop.
But if New York is change, then it's also rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but it's staffed by some of the original employees, and it's a similar, humble atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbe is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café, who is also the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay for his move to a new location, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even used the lighting from the old Verbe again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, too.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes ham, egg, and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady stream of original regulars.
"Many of Williamsburg's original customers have also been forced to move because of the price", he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers was here, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and came to the Verb Cafe a lot.
She kept coming even after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when the Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee altogether for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbu", she said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but that day he replaced his usual iced coffee with a blended chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a devoted Verve customer since 2003.
He's been going out before work and ordering the same thing every night.
"At a quarter to eight every day, like clockwork, I come in and they're already preparing my dough with everything and butter", he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order his usual, but occasionally he'll have bacon, eggs and ham on his porridge.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it", Rodriguez said.
The Greenpoint Cafe has also been well received by the traditional Polish community.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it up soon so his new neighbors would feel at home.
There are other benefits to a new place.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There's a possibility that the coffee shop could expand into the adjacent building.
For many customers, it's enough to get their old favourite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and he said when the coffee shop closed, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that now that the cafe's reopened, coming in for coffee is like coming home.
"I miss the smell", he said.
Depressed food from the Depression - at Square Meal
Shortly after taking office in March of 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
President Roosevelt's appetite was on the finest of Fifth Avenue's delicacies, like goose liver patties and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: devil's eggs in a paradise sauce, mashed potatoes, and as a dessert, plum pudding.
'It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who were suffering,' said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are a food historian.
Andrew Coe's last book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane's book, 97 Orchard, tells the life story of a Lower East Side apartment building through food.
Their new collaborative work, "A Square Meal", which Harper's is publishing on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity and met the reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Shop, a small, crisp buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the Great Depression, 1929.
Jane, 54, ordered a cream cheese and a sliced-olive sandwich, and Andrew, 57, had a turkey, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the pair said would make a great interview about food during the crisis.
'The bananas were very popular,' said Miss Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean curd were sold.
They made that ingredient and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe has gone to the dogs.
"It would lie in your stomach like lead", he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal traces the ways in which the nation came to terms with the fact that it was suddenly no longer a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared issue for the American people", Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious dishes like sausage and casserole dishes were becoming common, with casserole being a "great way to use leftovers", said Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for many years the centerpiece of American cuisine, has become a frugally allocated luxury.
The strange mixture, which was supposed to serve as a caloric and nutritional filling, was given priority over taste or even common sense in cooking.
While researching for a book containing recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a seasonal dish of baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table", said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: "It was surreal".
Peanut butter and baked onions don't go together.
It was typical of many home recipes.
As never before and never since, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, Federal Home Office Secretary from 1923 to 1943 - have been driving the nation's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, challenged women to take the reins of the budget, and turned fad diets like spaghetti and carrots into tasty meals.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historic delicacies.
Most notably, desserts were created in response to the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I'm having a pie" pose.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm food of his childhood, he dined like the select millionaire he had become.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce", said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in a nearly gold-plated room, wearing a tux.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't persuaded him to follow her example with his own stomach.
As the book tells, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a hostess who was completely uninterested in the taste, which resulted in the White House being served not only "almost the most perverse meal in all of Washington, but also the most unhappily prepared".
Many of the eating habits of the Depression years faded as the country got back on its feet.
The clue has remained in our continuing exploration of calories and nutritional value, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
A couple say that while writing the book they better understood Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - like why she couldn't throw away food.
'She had a real fear of wasting food,' said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman commented: "People were sick of her".
There was an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg had the tables cleared, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum cream", Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give humble recipes fancy names.
There was no cream, just prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly shoved a spoon into the dense brown matter.
Surprisingly bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then another one.
And as a good farmer, he said to his wife, "We could use some chopped up clams".
Europeans: Migrants are coming for their doses.
Most of the refugees who flock to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what shows would look like if we did them.
A group of Russian artists, calling themselves 2D Among Us, are making fun of their native country.
Using Photoshop, he creates collages that humorously show what it would be like if famous TV shows and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of legal representation in the patent case against type C jaundice v. Merck
The District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover attorneys' fees incurred in the litigation of the patent on the hepatitis C vaccine against the manufacturer of the Merck & Co. Inc. drugs.
In June, a judgment ordering Gilead to pay $200 million in damages for infringing Merck's two patents related to Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, was overturned after a federal judge found Merck repeatedly engaged in illegal conduct, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman entered a writ of habeas corpus on Thursday, stating that Gilead is entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominating the market for a new generation of anti-jaundice C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming to own basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
American-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij.
US-backed military forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the remnants of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city left.
The units have freed over 2,000 civilians who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching", he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which revealed that the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had a combined income of $10.75 million and an effective tax rate of 34.2 percent.
The Clintons donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in lecture fees to the common fund, and the former Secretary of State admitted to receiving $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, have released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
The Commission notes that the Commission did not provide any information on the amount of the tax to be paid by the beneficiaries.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be models of financial transparency", Jennifer Palmieri, who helped the Clintons with the campaign, said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false pretenses and backsliding on his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It's customary for presidential candidates to release their tax returns, even when they're not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited the U.S. Treasury Department's tax department audit as the reason for his refusal to release tax returns.
"Your move", a Hillary Clinton campaign aide said on Twitter, echoing the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release the tax returns until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican Party members, his rejection raises questions about his net income, charitable contributions, business transactions, and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Clinton has been vocal on the issue, and on Friday she released a video reminding how high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, you'll mention the issue in your speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"She refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done for decades - release her tax returns", she said in public.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very low taxes for the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist cited a number of tax advisers and accountants who said that may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a presidential election issue.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that anyone making more than $1 million a year pays at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama is also backing the bill.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Buffett called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also been audited by the IRS and that Trump isn't afraid of the IRS, he's afraid of the voters.
The Clinton campaign released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent in federal income tax and approximately 40.5 percent in combined income tax between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they make a mere $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chilli-filled condoms or fireworks for elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox method to prevent elephants from entering human habitations - they throw condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
This has proven to be a successful method, and Honeyguide, which came up with the idea a few years ago, and The Nature Conservancy, an American environmental organization, are promoting it and training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use this four-step, nonviolent method to protect their homes and crops without harming the animals.
Many of them used to use their spears for defense.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of elephants.
"Since they developed this ... toolkit, we've seen a change in behavior in these communities, people are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them", Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps are to flash a flashlight and sound the elephant's horn.
If that doesn't discourage him, there's a toss-up called the "Chili-Blu".
The chilli powder mixed with the salt is wrapped with the firecracker in a condom, its end is closed so that only the knot looks out.
When the condom is ignited, it explodes and a fine chilli powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually, one blow is enough to send the elephant off in another direction.
The last option is to fire the fireworks, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leans into Berlin hotel for removing code to call Israel at Arab request - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a media stir after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling Israel, according to an employee, at the request of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary film "Shoah", vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel's phone code list.
However, the state was not listed among the countries that can be reached by direct phone calls from a room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
It was written by Lanzmann.
The Kempinski Bristol Hotel instead offers the possibility of calling Israel through its own call centre.
The director sought an explanation and turned to the hotel reception desk with the problem.
The answer he got shocked Lanzman, according to him.
The hotel employee replied that the measure had been 'decided upon after consideration by the management of Kempinski Hotels'.
The reason for this move was further elaborated by the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the Israeli dialling code be deleted", Lanzmann quoted the employee in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a great shame".
We were shocked and appalled by the events.
That in itself is a huge disgrace.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany, and in a hotel chain like this, is even more shameful.
No further explanation is necessary.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, he said.
The incident has sparked a strong online response, with people calling it "scandalous".
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply got lost in the demands of the Arab customers.
"Shame on you", another post said, pointing out that the hotel, which is located in the noble Kurfurstendamm, is near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the incident "an oversight" and apologizing to Lanzman.
"No direct order has ever been issued" not to include Israel in the call code list, Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
He says the code for the call was added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian student protesters
Students and police clashed in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, as students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government security services tried to disperse the students, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
Proposals by the governor of the state of San Paulo, Geralda Alckmin, to save money include the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators were seen spraying graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, after the country's Senate decided to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
As the ambassador pointed out, since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies doing business in the country.
Russian companies are rebuilding existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is of course one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,' said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The surge in trade was driven by deliveries of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons, the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel visas.
In addition, Iran has entered the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year will be surpassed, he said.
At the same time, a relatively small number of Russians are visiting Iran, and the ambassador hopes that this will change.
'I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved,' he said.
Scottish rider Callum Skinner is hurrying home after the British win gold in cycling.
Callum Skinner of Scotland was inducted into the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at Rio Velodrome as the VB trio defended their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was the brake on his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend was delighted to come on and steal the victory from the favourite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise four years ago, and Hoy won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after finishing a modest sixth in the World Road Cycling Championships in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for specialist opening rider Jamie Staff.
Hindes is just in time.
After Hoye left, a position was also created that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man of British coaches and the search for potential was now confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was joint champion with Hoye four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic qualifying record, but the triathlon was taken in the first round by New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his lap, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going into higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes got on the podium, he couldn't take his eyes off them.
A 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: 'It is a flattering comparison.'
I'm here to make the best of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoye at London 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed onto the track after a poor start.
The note was later withdrawn and Britain's opponents had no chance to appeal.
This time around, there was no such problem with this victory.
Hindes said: "With all those British flags in the stands, it felt like London".
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We've lost a lot of world championships, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indication of progress over the past five months, then we have a successful five days at the track.
With the form that Kenny has shown, it's not unthinkable that he would repeat Ho's success and win three gold medals at the same Olympics.
That would mean a total of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred to British sport, as it is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
Same as Hoy got.
Kenny will be next in the sprint, which starts today and continues for the next three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "Now I'm enjoying this one.
Team racing is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal race of the day, but Britain had more good news to come.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull have qualified as the fastest to compete in the four-mile team pursuit.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, which was set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (22:42) will take place on the second day of the race, which will be the focus of Wiggins' attention.
He was debating with the stewards before the qualifying yesterday when the judges asked him to change his height.
In the women's race, which continues and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team GB relied on their strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-Olympic period and win a lot of medals.
After really extraordinary performances, proving to be absolutely superior in Beijing and London, expectations were lowered in preparation for Rio.
There were dramatic events going on behind the scenes, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the career ending of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of racing at the velodrome demonstrates, it seems that the legendary reputation of Team Great Britain being able to deliver top performance with perfect timing could be vindicated once again.
Uncertain future of the Portland tavern after the termination of the power supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt because of a power plant that supplies the company with electricity, which has informed one of the smelter's owners of its intention to terminate the power contract, and it is expected that all power contracts will be cut.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided earlier this year not to extend the grants that keep the company running.
The 20-year fixed grant expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk if the plant is closed.
And because the mill consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's electricity, it can have further avalanche effects.
Alcoa closed its Point Henry tavern in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa Tavern in Portland is bankrupt and threatened with closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the cost of producing the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expected one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small business shares held by Chinese company CITIC and Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the foundry will continue to be high, she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called 'reinsurance contracts' which were to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017, the power plant said.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the measures in question are imputable to the State.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its books to $187 million in the event of termination.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract 'will not affect its ability to operate the taverna or to secure the supply of electricity to the taverna'.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that was to take effect from November this year, though it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL operations manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, speaking to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year, and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not received any comments from the interested parties.
It wouldn't be good for us as producers, he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian reality TV show - she's now the cover of September's Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and the fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the Kardashian-Jenner family, has appeared on the cover of the September issue of American Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who has been showcasing at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page", Kendall wrote.
The cover reveal was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the Kardashian-inspired humor?) staged video featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the barbaric troublemakers Rob and Caitly, and along with them, the showbiz favorite uncle, Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sisters on the cover, only for the scene to end in a classic twist: they're preparing a secret party.
It's the over-the-top storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show, but Kris needed to make sure that the other girls in the audience could feed off of it.
Because if you look at the September issue of Vogue, we've definitely entered a new era of the Kardashians.
Older sister Kim may have put Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a different story.
The January issue of Vogue is the biggest selling issue of the year.
The magazine, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 pages of advertising content out of 832 pages in last year's edition).
The cover star is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, images of the magazine have leaked before it was even officially published.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrities who are models" on the front page than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the cover in 2013, followed by Lady Gaga a year later.
But while it's highly unlikely that Kendall - who the magazine describes as "the breakthrough model of her generation" - will fall into the first category, she'll be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor are they reality stars, or kids today who know how to make well-edited videos (even though Jenner represents all of these).
They're demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who made the cover last year, had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of her album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymour, a former Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid in June, calling them "momentary freaks".
These feelings were rekindled by the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is not appropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
He's doing a show for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he's doing a reality show, maybe just as one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal aid centers turn down 160,000 people a year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid each year in community centres and the sector itself is facing the effects of further cuts in funding for already overburdened services.
In Queensland, three in five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without the financial means to fight unjust eviction and so on - are rejected the moment they seek free legal help and representation.
Community legal services, already strained to the breaking point, are preparing for further cuts.
Starting next June, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Aid Centers, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers summary report, it was found that 5,000 people are rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without the federal government's decision being reversed, the situation will worsen.
"Community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are denied the vital services they need", he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with an abuser, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which will leave thousands more at-risk people in Queensland to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately stop this cuts in funding so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the State Government has met its commitment to provide legal aid funding up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit against the Donald Trump campaign after a staff member allegedly pointed a gun at
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations in North Carolina had pointed a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court filing filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software coach for the state's campaign.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that it wasn't going to happen.
Director Earl Phillip pointed his finger at the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the gun at Vincent's head, Bordini said in the complaint.
The file says that after complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing as Phillip.
"Guns don't have to fire to cause harm", Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a stir by telling North Carolina voters that gun owners could be prosecuted under the Second Amendment if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and can appoint her own judge.
Trump's campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
Bordini's lawsuit is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent oversight and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawful use of force and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip have been unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news outlet in Charlotte, has announced that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was short-lived.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is leading a controversial campaign.
The Commission also found that the applicants had not been able to demonstrate that they had been in compliance with the requirements of the Code of Conduct for the investigation of the alleged violation of the provisions of the Code of Conduct for the investigation of the alleged violation of the provisions of the Code of Conduct for the investigation of the alleged violation of the Code of Conduct for the investigation of the alleged violation of the Code of Conduct for the investigation of the alleged violation of the Code of Conduct for the investigation of the alleged violation of the Code of Conduct.
Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not just for our local communities and across London, but for the country.
For me, Heathrow is a huge attraction, just like London 2012, where we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics were a huge benefit to both Startford and the East End.
And we're going to do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses in the vicinity of Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we're going to create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs, and we're going to end youth unemployment in the airport area.
As in the run-up to the London 2012 Olympics, there will be those who think the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and the Heathrow case will prove to be wrong.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth, and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, who have, on time and on budget, implemented an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, starting with Terminal 5 - which has been voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, followed by Terminal 2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver the third runway, which will cost 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London Games in 2012 were a huge success for the UK, and I'm sure the expansion of Heathrow will be a huge success too.
It is time we continued to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in a game of cat and mouse in ad blocking
Attempts to bypass ad-blocking programs have become a cat-and-mouse game for companies that make money off of online marketing, according to one of the companies that develops the software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users can update the filters in their program and re-block ads on the social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it harder for ad filters to figure out which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says the new codes have already been circumvented.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source ad-blocking community and those trying to circumvent it has been going on since ad-blocking was invented", and that Facebook is likely to come up with its own fix.
The fact that the company that owns the largest social network in the world got involved in the war just goes to show how big a problem ad blocking has become for the industry.
According to a study done last year by Pagefair and Adobe, there are about 200 million people around the world who use ad filters - almost four times the number in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
A spokesperson said the company is, however, opposed to desktop ad filters because mobile ad filters on the social network and Instagram mobile apps don't work.
Desktop ads are still a big enough revenue stream that Facebook decided to invest in it.
Facebook also said Tuesday that it will update its ad preferences tool to give people more control over how ads appear to them.
Facebook said Thursday that the new Adblock filters are a concern because they could also block content on the site that is not related to advertising.
"It's not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem", a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blocking is a very insensitive tool, and that's why we've focused instead on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway.
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident where a woman was hit by a car on a highway in the early hours of Thursday morning, apparently trying to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actress of the "Desperate Killer" was found lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It's clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, attempted suicide and was struck by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died instantly.
Several drivers have been questioned, but police say they have yet to identify all of them, and are calling on these drivers and any other witnesses to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
It's still necessary to determine if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid the collision?
That's what the prosecutor has to find out, Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one involving a highway passerby - it was determined that motorists could not wait for a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of manslaughter after she struck and killed a man lying on the A1 near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, aged 22, had drunk alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to an emergency call - was driving in an appropriate manner and that the presence of the man on the road was a 'totally exceptional and unforeseeable situation,' the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident Thursday at Morges should contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20 000 visitors to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday, the executive director of AČCKA, Katerina Petříčková, made the announcement.
The sixth annual Prague Pride kicked off on August 8, bringing the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people closer together.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is among the most popular destinations for the LGBT community, due to its high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses", said Petříčková.
According to a survey by the organisers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of 3100 krona per person per day.
To support gay tourists in their travels, a special map of Prague is available with a complete list of gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in Prague in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"The general trend in tourism is that LGBT clients are very lucrative, they are interested in stays at higher prices with a high standard of tourism services and spend more than others", Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is being held as part of the festival programme this year.
It features lectures by LGBT travel industry experts from Europe, the US and China.
The festival will continue until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also cover several thematic areas, such as the family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be the traditional parade with floats, which will take place on Saturday from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
A parade that has drawn thousands of people in past years will hold a moment of silence this year to honor the victims of the June nightclub shooting in Orlando, where a gunman shot dead 49 people, mostly gay men.
Pat and Matt are celebrating 40 years.
The indomitable, endearingly disastrous Pat and Matt have entertained audiences of all ages for over 40 years.
The pilot episode of this late-night series directed by Lubomir Benes premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries around the world, were cartoon jokes by artist and director Lubomír Benes, who invented them for the magazine with two cockroaches, Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the playwright Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimir Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
The characters were given their present-day form with yellow and red jerseys and a ball and radio in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began in the Short Film Prague.
Pat Jména and Mat Kováček were given the role in 1985, this time it was already filmed for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own animation studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where he produced other works.
After his death in 1995, other works with other creators continued, many of them with the participation of Beneš's son Marek.
There are currently over 90 episodes of these cockroaches, who are all over the place, but never mad at each other, and always full of optimism, ideas and cockroach-like enthusiasm, and finally satisfied with their work, as evidenced by the well-known gesture "...and it's done!".
Pat and Matt have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs, theaters, and toys featuring the characters of Pat and Matt are a hit with every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmony.
This weekend is all about fairy tales, so we've picked out one for you from sports and one from life.
They both have good endings.
Let's have a look.
Fiji has achieved a historic achievement.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what are the things that people spend the most money on at airports?
This is the Friday World Wide Web Review.
The first Olympic medal.
The island nation of Fiji is celebrating a historic achievement.
The rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the Great Britain team in the final of the Olympic rugby sevens tournament.
This is the first medal ever won by Fiji at the Olympics.
The wait for the first precious metal was sixty years since the first Olympic expedition was sent.
Much of the credit for the success goes to the Fiji coach.
But the irony is that he is the Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be happy unlike his fellow countrymen.
"Let's play it loose and easy and see if we can make the biggest game in our history", the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually took control of it, and the small nation of 900,000 people is now living the Olympic fairy tale.
The French daily Le Monde reported the news.
New friend and happiness for the little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who's been living without arms and legs for 11 months, has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me", a two-year-old girl said, as her mother revealed to ABC News.
She added that her daughter liked to take off her arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis less than a year after her birth, and doctors gave her only a ten-percent chance of survival.
There's nothing about her I don't love.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He has a vision.
I saw her introduce herself to the other children with the words "Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands", the mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has caused.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
CNN is reporting a study that shows that people spend the most on bottled water at airports.
Hudson's travel essential stores released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products that customers in its airport shops buy most frequently.
Water was supremely first.
The drinks were generally very popular, with eight of them in the top ten.
In ninth place was a large box of coconut-flavored M&Ms.
And can you guess who's closing the top ten?
It's the only one of the above that can't be eaten.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include the New York Post, The New York Times and USA Today.
Among them are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond were laughing.
New Zealand's Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have been the undisputed kings of the coxless pair for seven years, and they have confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the uncooperative duo moved to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing the competition since 2009.
At the Lagoon Rodrigo de Freitas, they won their 69th straight in the quarterfinals.
How are we different from the others?
We're just prettier, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he was asked about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
To be honest, we're not doing anything different than anyone else.
We just train hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a six-foot-tall, stocky-tailed blackbird, and the academically-looking Bond is two inches shorter and 30 pounds lighter.
They also have different personalities.
Bond studies and finance, Murray's a charity boxing match.
And because of that, they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's basically boarding the ship with the idea that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what can go wrong, Bond admitted, and he made a point at the press conference that Murray is the dominant member of the crew.
He was always the first to respond, and Bond waited for his chance.
On the water, however, he destroys his opponent with steady force.
They are speeding up, and although they are often not in the lead halfway through the race, the opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile over the line.
We're just trying to keep the pace that nobody else can.
"We know what we have to do to win", said Murray, 34.
With a partner four years his junior, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members of the golden four were without a helm.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to switch to a crew without a helmsman.
In the London Olympics, they suffered perhaps the biggest defeat of their career, and they reasserted their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us to do, and we didn't ask any questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was going to be a hell of a ride, and we had to make sure we were mentally well", Murray said.
We know they all want to overthrow us.
We've got that target on our back all the time.
But we try to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
Venus was once habitable, according to NASA climate models
According to NASA's new climate model projections, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless, and CO2-saturated surface, could have had conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus once boasted a thin atmosphere like Earth's and rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the early topography of Venus.
The planet may have had areas that were drier than Earth, but it once had enough water and geographical diversity to support life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus also used to take advantage of the Sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
In a GISS model simulation, Venus exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months at a time during a slow rotation, explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which forms a dense layer of clouds that act as an umbrella to protect the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually a little bit lower than we have on Earth today.
The model constructed a Venus-like evolution story, which was previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus was probably inhabited in the past -- over billions of years -- it was exposed to extreme heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was scorched by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped, leaving behind a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers have published their results from a new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy has resigned as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, citing the inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move, stating that the club will begin looking for a new head coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination", said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I've spent a lot of time over the summer thinking about how I can improve this team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to the next level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be aligned with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team's performance.
Those conditions are not currently fulfilled.
The jersey that Roye received on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today", Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization, and we wish him well in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and in the last two years, they've never lost a postseason game.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season 39:39:4 and were five points short of earning the second wild card in the Western Conference.
Hall of Famer Roy has won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and end strike
Senior officials from the parties to the negotiations said that the strike over wages for workers on the North Sea oil rigs is being suspended while all parties to the dispute have been brought together for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the Wood Group oilfield services company have occurred sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process for resolving the current dispute, the statement said.
Starting next week, we'll have a series of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we'll try to look at problems from new angles.
According to the trade union organizations, their recent action, which they say was the first in over 25 years, to protest against wage cuts is up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9% less this year due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates follows the 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to deal with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell has cut thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernize its processes - immediately after a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes of a generation, which led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, was vital to the economy of the region.
'In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some,' he said in a statement.
By comparison, in 2016 almost $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, whereas the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler is measuring the rotation rate of the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope to help astronomers is to obtain a near-complete list of the rotation rates of the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at different speeds and how the rotation time relates to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with those of other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar mass, its age and even the history of its solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a new report.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood, having formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it's spinning at full speed.
At times of peak rotational speed, these young stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotation rate slows.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of distinctive points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotation rates, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones do the pirouettes more slowly than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades cluster, we see that the slowest-rotating stars are the most massive, while the fastest-rotating ones are usually very light stars", Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and their rotation rates.
'The pleia provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars,' said Rebull.
There's still a lot we want to know about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rate and, so to speak, "hang their dancing shoes on their nails".
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed the latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotation rates in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then wouldn't the qualification deal be closed and I could transfer to another hospital after a few months?
Is it possible to work after graduation without enrolling in specialized education?
The point is that the field I'd like to work in now has a vacancy at a hospital a little further away, but in about six months there could be a vacancy at another one where I'd like to work.
I don't know how to handle the situation for about six months, the question continues.
This is Bishop Lenka Vlková.
The employer-hospital agreement is not required by law.
The qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in improving or deepening the qualification of the employee.
However, there is a long-standing pressure in the health sector not to conclude such agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of healthcare workers and not all hospitals currently require such an agreement.
The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of the Slovak Republic have decided to extend the period of validity of the qualification to the period of validity of the qualification.
This means that a qualifying agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs amount to at least CZK 75 000.
There is no legislation or obligation to enrol in specialised training.
The law only specifies the conditions for applying for specialised education.
However, the law allows a doctor to practise as a doctor only after having completed the necessary university studies, even under the conditions laid down by law (under the supervision of a doctor with specialised qualifications in the relevant field).
The law provides for the possibility of including in specialist medical education professional experience acquired in another field of specialization, provided that its content and scope correspond to the corresponding training programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to count time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the applicant's situation.
However, as I am not aware of the details of the case, I would recommend consulting the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), as the Ministry of Health provides by law an advisory and consultative service related to the admission to and the continuation of specialised education.
The Czech Medical Chamber also provides free consultation services, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from Aleppo, Syria, are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (of the rebel-held part of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, AFP quoted a letter to the White House as saying.
"We don't need tears, sympathy, or even prayers; we desperately need a no-fly zone over eastern Aleppo to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Aleppo is not besieged again", the doctors said.
Russian forces backing the army loyal to President Bashar Assad have announced that they will stop their attacks in the Halab area for three hours every day from today to allow safe passage for the humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 CET, all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire will be suspended.
UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed the move but stressed the need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors working in the rebel-held eastern part of Halab have contacted Obama in a letter.
He writes that during the five-year war, he witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and realizing how complicated Syria is, but it's doing little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like thinly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors noted.
Doctors said that in the past month, there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of which were on hospitals where they work.
What makes us sad is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have young children coming into the ER with injuries so severe that we have to pick the ones that are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't have the materials to help them, the doctors said.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion cut off the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They gasped for breath, and then their life ended - before it could really begin, they noted.
Armies loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, have surrounded rebel-held eastern Halab in recent weeks, leaving more than 200,000 people without food supplies inside.
Rebels, under constant Russian and Syrian air strikes, broke through the three-week siege on Saturday and launched a counter-offensive.
Both sides then added reinforcements in and around the city.
