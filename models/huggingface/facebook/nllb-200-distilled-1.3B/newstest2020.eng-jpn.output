Toledano said it was also uncle how factors like birth weight were accounted for.
"It shows there is some kind of additional risk from air pollution for infant death but the way that it has been set up is quite a crude analysis", said Toledano.
Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said action must be taken to tackle the public health crisis of air pollution - including introducing clean air zones in the most polluted cities.
"The evidence linking infant mortality and air pollution is still emerging but Dr. Kotecha's study, which suggests babies born in the UK's most polluted areas see a significantly increased risk of death, should be a wake-up call to government", she said.

Woods said the study mirrored previous findings, adding that children cannot protect their own lungs. Woods said the study mirrored previous findings.
"Both these studies focus on the damage done by air pollution to some of the most vulnerable members of our society - the very young", she said.
