UKIP residents who reject those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to make the queue behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think it is you who are using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing idiots, practically does not exist.
I think that is what is called democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the UKIP parallel universe that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch is not a proof.
Shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don’t think you know what a special argument is.
You also know nothing about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage’s phrase surprised many, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made no homophobic remarks.
You will have to be able to recover.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don’t like when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is talked about so rarely because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that humanity’s complexities are something good, then not.
The situation is as bad in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will have nothing arranged.
To expect almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was known as the “Tiger of Europe” a few years ago.
We knew the following.
I start reading the article again.
They are trying to make people believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a “NEW ECONOMIC WONDER” is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible work march, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients, there is nothing to “pavoise” at the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the newy countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is clear in light of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
It is false!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the policy of taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If one believes a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only small and medium-sized enterprises are paying.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become enormous again, and there are new (and expensive) cars in every corner of the street, exactly as before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the everyday locks since the return.
Is this a matter of economic actuality?
Don’t worry, I’m sure the comments will burn up soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a collision on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O’Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bugs and scratches on the old will soon be forgotten.
That said I’m flying with him next week, so I hope it’s not going to be on one of those two once refuelled.
This is the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay passengers a surcharge for the additional fear that was intended to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn’t afford to go on vacation, young man.
I’ve never taken Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it’s Ryanair, so they can give it to their hearts.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the base rate only have to deal with themselves, etc.
It is quite transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether the passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of the airport controllers.
Passengers were placed on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome on board this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good travel
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crowded with people.
People don’t come in mass for the quality of the restaurants (some, mostly) or for the Salon de la Revue at the Espace des Blancs-Pantels (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending...
Do you think Sunday opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, full of people with 50% of tourists.
It is false!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they shop at retail.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
There is still an industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allows prices to fall.
Sunday rest is a right for employees, except for exceptions.
That is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister in charge of the economy, nor the minister in charge of foreign affairs, have the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
When they close it.
What is the law for?
To satisfy a portion of the population and companies who want to work on Sundays.
In Montreal on Sunday, I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal biblio is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is the access to culture.
The same applies to the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he firmly defended against fascism and Bolshevism.
What if her daughter’s estate was, against her will, used to pay heritage costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
I’m sure he wants his share of the cake, if you give me the expression.
His preference for a nationalist/Franco victory in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to independence from places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither is me.
But for 5 years, and only for 5 years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he led the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Through his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, in the end, the whole world, can thank God for having during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill’s greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
Whether his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise money from succession fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It is as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, because infrastructure construction sites are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the real French evil: the distrust of dialogue.
Return to Principles.
The reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let not the weakest of us be in need.
Either we come to his aid in solidarity, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he does or has rendered at a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives from the income of his property.
It is necessary to differentiate between the one who invests for a return at the time of retirement and the one who lives on his pensions.
One good to rent, or even two for a couple above, is vice.
The small genius of finance lacks imagination.
The new deal was a policy of big work, but at a time of large infrastructure shortage.
In France and Europe this is not the case.
The developed countries are overpowered.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in nothing a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline arises in response to a recession that is only a savage and then brutal decline.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or possibilities) for dam, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less rough, then the need for investments is crying out: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy, etc...
A taxation that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a galop.
Samsung’s profits are hurt by the iPhone 6 and its competitors
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to the benefit of Apple.
I think we need to have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people attach no value to design, for them options, functionality and price prevail.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a “better car manufacturer”, not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in the interest of all of us.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight the ideas and not the men (on the contrary, on Paris bobos) could tell us which author (s) they fight the ideas on gender and indicate us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I love you very much, and you are someone smart and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holopherne, an approximation that had not come to me (I do not have its vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "fund", since you refer to it, this topic does not interest me, and frankly I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
@Jean: Recognize that, culturally, to send Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who is afraid of the world?
What are they afraid of who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us elements of answer.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat cutting machine.
You can see how much these studies affect the most intimate in their home.
We are no longer in the debate of ideas.
It is something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: I thought it was a good idea to go to the source.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only exposition that their detractors make of them (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of the Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, this is the whole difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure if the nuance is understood.
I didn’t read Judith, the very symbolic throat cutter, I contented myself with the “Second Sex” (it was more of my time) which is I think the source of “the source” according to Lo’s wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened up.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat offset the disappointment of having sometimes the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was great here at NFC.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really overwhelm the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
A special blood moon.
Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will return it to its true colour as soon as possible.
It obsesses you, right?
I was in Melbourne so of course I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself for the entire week from the Perseid meteor rain and for virtually all of the major astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I begin to think that there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn’t see the eclipse because of the clouds above the Melbourne suburb.
I'm going to put a tax on this eclipse.
Anyone watching this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet that your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will be obsessed with you when it ends up disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Wonderful picture of the moon above Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
It seems that Mars will collide with Earth.
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
There is no difference in income between labor and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
The ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing in the gardens of Babylon.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments for these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext links to the original documents so that one can make an opinion.
Check out on Tuesday 15 October the results of miracle revenue: in Spain, exports are at the lowest in five years.
The Greek stock market is collapsing.
These are the examples to be followed.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy says that these claims are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Finance made a mistake?
Will the decision makers who have gained the political gain resulting from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The next in its time.
Ok, thank you Jyl...
@lol No, the state is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments that guarantee future growth and thus future revenue.
A few points of answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first of all.
Great conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your imagination.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by the law as written by politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these questions politicians want to please the ignorant masses.
Doctors don’t make money with medications.
That’s why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don’t make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our healthcare system to look like that of the United States, you should find out how it works.
Doctors all over the world are courtesy in the same way, but this is more or less visible.
It may have been misformulated to blame toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and “research.”
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the worldwide prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is on free sale or only on prescription.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, either direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite laws that curb them and expensive permits required.
While manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
I’m sorry to tell you, but you’re mistaken, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a manager of that hospital.
You cannot have patents on the grass.
If “researchers” in social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, one might be using their “work.”
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
Comparing is doing pedagogics, not research.
You can’t say “the research is done, you have to apply it” and then in the same jet “you have to experiment with everything.”
If your research succeeds, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can one explain to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other subjects more easily?
New technologies enable learning on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they don’t know how to learn?
PISA tests are just an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfying to us.
What’s the point of building an indicator that tells you what’s going on with you, a willingness to promote yourself, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to remove the sophists and ideologists from the training, and that the practitioners teach the practitioners.
Read the paragraph on stages (which, unfortunately, is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion drives us to the most ineffective conservatism: “It is a device that leads first and foremost to the reproduction of the practices in force, and which does not allow the system to progress.”
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, one cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in a modern training of teachers.
The theorists of education should have no place.
The practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to educational theorists would be destroying it permanently.
Your analogy is totally ferocious: if I’t want to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I’t want to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and has learned from the pile.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of David Cameron's copyright infringement
Why didn’t he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thanks to MDR Exmaiers.
If someday I start to feel guilty of violating copyright, I’ll read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement is theft.
It is the same as they must correctly cite their sources.
Often, obtaining a license costs nothing.
This is a violation of copyright.
Not the same at all.
By using content without the proper license, you deprive artists of their earnings.
You can always argue about pedant assumptions – but it’s theft.
You can repeat it as much as you want, but it won’t happen.
This is a violation of copyright.
Go and repeat it again.
If someday I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright
It doesn’t bother to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in schoolwork, a perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I’m happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
The first lesson should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they give up any intellectual property to the site under the general terms that they passed with a click.
Per if they share the headsets of their mp3 walker with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Oh if we could export that resource of which we are filled, the rash that says that everything is wrong...
If it’s a MP who says that, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they are in the age of choosing, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France is pulling people down by constantly assisting them.
I don’t want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down are speeches like yours.
I have always worked in a private company.
I have had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I’m an employee because I know I don’t have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red bullets on the null bosses I often encounter.
Comfortably in my baskets I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large companies and medium-sized and small - What are French bosses expecting to do so?
Does the state hold their hand?
What are the accusations of imperialism?
by Jacques L.
This is an anti-entrepreneurial approach from your side.
Remember me, what did you create as employment, as added value, to be so severe?
I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who brag and humiliate while waiting for the permanent assistance of the state!
It is terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours a week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages or their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
That’s ironic considering how people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I am from, Last was not really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay on the flow instead of transforming themselves.
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this.
I tried to get them recently, but I failed.
But the job will get bored, right?
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more ethical business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all for the decision to eventually be cancelled.
And there’s better: MTR, a Hong Kong company, won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is entirely for unification and sharing and believes that all workers should help each other across borders.
We can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Per it is because the Dutch management is on the right track while the British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio is the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisee.
“She was a fighting girl.”
God, I hate it, but I really hate this kind of expression.
To assume that the fact of being “beating” is a quality superior to many others, the care of others, the intelligence, the listening, for example, the fact of being “beating” has nothing to do with that of surviving a disease: cancerous “beating”, who are not less dead, I know some of them.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let’s start again too.
I’m not telling you that this is the condition to manage, I’m telling you that it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit.
When it comes to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I start again.
To insinuate, even for a moment, that one may have the merit of getting out of a disease or that one may deserve not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that drops, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think the opposite, though, having a solid morality makes it easier to accept heavy treatments and prepare for them, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is fighting in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if you prefer to give it to the “God,” that’s something else.
Not with merit or courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you take away yourself to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two, dirty, big ones, and if I "fought" myself as these end psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this struggle consists only in striking the teeth, suffering the hell and collecting the beats.
I believed that the indictment against Milosevic had been decided and finalised a decade ago.
I haven’t seen that name in the newspapers since then.
What is happening?
It is a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was carried out “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story that was told at the time?
The communist became nationalist who sparked three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
So please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under the least rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians, then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against the attacks of NATO, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the western compressor wheel.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to disconnect part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was well recognized by Western states who then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for not being able to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian shouldn’t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works roughly by measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly helpful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located approximately 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules,” according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to follow.
Like those involving animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you, passers of science, for delighting us, often, with these experimental achievements that are realized in the world.
How do animals know?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon for example.
A gas a priori odorless for humans but detectable by animals.
All these methods are indetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has at his disposal.
We do not have reliable results on these tracks.
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on art telling the fight of two scientific teams, one of California and the other of Japan, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more their modification before an earthquake.
I am not a scientist, but my hypotheses convinced me.
Or is it about this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We need to learn to listen to nature.
If you look at things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a serious journal, and no one disregards it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we come across the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish bizarly turned in a circle.
I do not understand how one can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He worked as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can’t help but think that this man doesn’t know anything about it and that he’s always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor, and he did not keep one.
It just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because it is popular.
Because it is funny.
It was “Have I got news for you.”
Because it is a celebrity and people have been instilled the adoration of celebrities.
The people of London voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will break the ceiling I am sure.
May God help us.
I’m not so sure: people like jokes, but they don’t want their prime minister to be one of them.
This is exactly what the Londoners say.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than he was.
In many ways, I think he is trying to copy R. Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have really and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the trouble to read a few books (there are, including a French and excellent from B.
Millot), the “Salomon” and the “ferrous strait” speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must still be there at the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to go back there.
We went to the island of Savo in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
They are the little ones.
But the ecological side is a total smoke.
Calculate the amount of kerosene consumed to the goal completely decredits the concept.
Just browse through the list of sponsors than philanthropists.
It’s an operation of nothing else to do or do.
The cow is so excited!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recitation makes me look back, identifying myself a little by the way (I also learned to sail with the Crocos of L’Elorn to the White Moulin on the banks of Brest!).
There is also a hat for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep making us look back, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travellers!
Peter of Trinidad and Tobago.
I think the red hood that has protested against taxes is pleased to know that this trip is sponsored by the Bretagne Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to fund the dreams of a few adventurers even as sympathetic as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian team who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they are still in the team.
Bisevac is the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfield or ahead in the 70s and 80s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the big Velez team that, under the tutelage of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished second twice in the Yugoslav league (and also counted points like Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger's loyal teammate, Boro Primorac).
Thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen it was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I cannot help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know there is no holder.
Could he still do something, in the Indian Super League?
Seriously about Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, do not be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The trick is that the flag of this drone is not the actual flag of Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism.
Fortunately, there was not much damage (as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give pieces of the country to neighbouring countries.
How can one have felt “an explosion of joy” seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children are inside?
How is it ???
What troubles me a little about this "testimony" is that the only fact that I was able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a "border line" personality whose "testimony" should be taken with the utmost caution.
Without a doubt, in the short moment of "joie", one will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One would only have thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically harm the great evil Satan in his own heart.
To make a powerful.
of grandiose.
It seems that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims rotted by their feelings of humiliation.
Filmed in Palestine.
This is Schadenfreude.
We doubted a little.
The “Christian/White/Galician” West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today’s Arab-Muslim world.
I’m talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algeria, not the tours of Dubai.
The past splendor, magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can the Muslim world get out of this devil?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: conservatism bigotry of the powers in place and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood before, must not make the Muslims retreat.
That is the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, humid and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
The seasonal depression.
I suffer myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a bit for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to breathe out in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you are lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We have had a great summer this year, don’t make your clichés crazy!
Not all of them.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I’m retired and I’m no longer developing immunity to germs from outside, that can change, I guess.
It’s not about to die, it’s just a step in a cycle.
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a fever that culminates with celebrations like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snowfall and full of other wonderful words.
Do not stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child allowances, it is the amount collected by the state that mainly comes from deciles 8 to 10.
But as for the number of households who have seen their taxes increase following this measure, it is mainly the 4 and 5 deciles that are concerned (median income) according to graph 2.
The removal of the half concerned especially widows is not dealt with at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
It is not ready to settle.
We are not on the palm of course, but dreamer
For once the PS is making a policy rather than the left, we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Keep doing this and you will encourage those 20% less to work or leave.
I know this is not politically correct, but I say it.
Viva the Trots and the OCI recycled in the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you see what you are looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to accumulate as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money has been exceeded, it serves only to make money, that is to say, to make the misfortune of the most.
We are among the richest 20 percent.
Probably also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth of which part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or even lower arms and live social minima, especially if you have a social housing.
The utopias of the Red Khmer head-cuts have fortunately survived.
I made two Airbnbs in Norway recently.
There is no problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we’t have in a 5-star hotel and we didn’t have to show up at the reception or deal with the slightest trouble.
You just have to go to someone’s house, sleep there, lay behind you and go back.
From now on, it will be my first option when I’m traveling.
The world has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need some kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
6 hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and very risky” No, it’s not true.
You just really missed luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb’s response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has received no support from Airbnb?
I love Airbnb, to receive as to travel
I am looking for people who have used Airbnb just to reassure me.
I’m considering paying a deposit and a month’s rent at once but I’m a bit afraid of sending £1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where do we go?
“Support the troops,” Bu$herie sang in all tones.
They are harmless weapons.
I am sure it will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends succeeded to anything other than the chemical bombing of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polite).
Furthermore, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the author’s style: “in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We are very agreed.
You believe it is time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
We would already strengthen education a lot if “they” were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
Our teachers now earn more than engineers.
And let’s not make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not seen because the National Education has no means to provide a college/high school office for its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced remote work, except that the employer pays neither the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
By the way, it’s so much the board at 5 a.m. a week and 4 months of vacation that we can’t fill the CAPES of math, come, we’re waiting for you.
Why don’t you want to catch up with poorly educated thorns whose parents spit on you by treating you as a thorn?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Kurdish population can thrive better.
It is evident that the Bush administration has done everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, earning three times nothing, and yet it was a job for which a diploma was required.
A year later, I saw an advertisement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more a year and they didn’t even apply for the patent.
I have never regretted.
In this regard, don’t worry if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well, or you like to do.
If I had stayed on graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan
I don’t like working in business so I hope to go into public service or the academic world in the future.
LOL LOL LOL This article comes really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year delay.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of cuddles like art / letters / theater / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is, what is called unemployed degrees.
I have one of those diplomas and I finished as a production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Sure, the starting salary was lower, but you quickly climb the ladder because in the real world what matters is the results more than knowledge.
This debate of engineering/art studies has been ongoing for years.
Scientists can’t solve all problems, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in order to get results.
Are literature, philosophy and art bisexual?
It is ridiculous.
I suppose you’re talking about media study degrees or whatever the abscons chain you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real branches.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the fundamentals of culture such as literature, art, etc., and emphasize them.
Wouldn’t it be better to have a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I don’t see the inhabitants of the Essonne and Val-d’Oise slopes of going 80km back and forth every day by bicycle to come to work in Paris.
In-wall and small belt residents already have many otherwise more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
Several safe and locked parks, as they already exist in the northern European cities, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
A good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
By the way, the City of Paris is expected to work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
There was no room for a single bicycle.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë.
Well, it is not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other public transport users the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these vanes, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and care about the survival of bicycles 2/ we get full of pollution in the head For me the cycling trails are bad to go, we need to reduce the traffic (urban toll type congestion load), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), to respect the road code by verbalizing systematically (even the bicycles in front of which it is necessary to adapt the road code written for vanes 100 years ago to bicycles), generalize the zones after the clouded passages, not before the vanes and scooters do not bother.
The cycling trails are apartheid, we need to cohabit but re-balance the occupation of urban space.
No bicycle in Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of displacements in velo is ridiculous.
I start to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
However, in the wake of the report, the EELV deputy appear to be skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket begins, it would be better to find out who really is behind this massacre.
The point is that it is not Russia.
I don’t like the way the world evolves.
It looks horrible.
Children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they would have to file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed until the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
But Libya did not explode the Pan Am 103.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine launched airstrikes against the rebels in the area and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat, or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people in order for the airlines to pay the flight fees over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurpatory government/Western Ukraine ultranationalists – and who want to demonstrate largely that Putin shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
The previous: a 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA supply of weapons to the Contras rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this matter go to the ICC.
It’s funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his claims.
So far, the investigators have not said anything like this.
To call yourself Ricardo and be such a beotian in eco is sad!
Being called Polar is losing the north is joyful.
Is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can’t help but notice that those who most violently criticize Piketty’s book have not read it!
It’s easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequality of labor income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that today’s concentration of capital meets that of the early 20th century before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumed after that.
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this paper knowing that an individual’s ability to concentrate has some limits.
The question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, one can argue about it without reading the book, the essence of which is to argue in a single way in favor of it.
No, it is easy to read.
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavet summarized by the press false?
I have not read it and will not read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis, and it is that which seems to me to be pure smugglership.
The difference between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has humanity not enriched itself?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without a doubt.
Remember, she is only 17 years old.
A time when most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old saying that colorful pervers are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere – not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a bit strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that, if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored pervers”?
You should not have any “antenna time” on this site.
You yourself are a terrible pervert.
This is absolutely rebellious.
Her father would not marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 years old when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are taught and he is in favor of equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, for her to receive a higher education and for her to have the right to decide herself about her marriage.
However, he is someone unusual in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at the age of 14, without having her word to say.
I apologize for not saying it eloquently enough for you.
This may sound contradictory, but maybe it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Quite disappointed by this entry in terms of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a bit of trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich sosie character.
I’ve just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it’s one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The execution is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronic Life on Mars is just upsetting.
I have not yet watched this new season (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I’d rather have it all at once than watch 13 episodes spanning 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is for sure, apart from Jessica Lange’s extraordinary, it’s mostly the risks of staging and assembly that sided me.
There is an avalanche of original plans in AHS that ridicule the asepticization of today’s productions.
It’s a bit out of mind to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to evaluate its quality.
Jessica Lange is a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
It’s not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series beyond the technical qualities.
Well, I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite a few excellent episodes.
I don’t see them making 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end like 24 hours what.
Everyone does what they want!
It’s because I say “I won’t look again” that everyone is forced to do the same!
I agree with you, nothing more, nothing less.
I think Jessica Lange’s loss will be fatal.
But after that, that’s just my opinion.
Let’s talk less about tax increases, please – let’s cut on state spending instead.
Please increase the expenses.
Those who wanted to squeeze in the expenses failed.
triggering controversy over relatively small spending items, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the error margin in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we’re all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to call their wishes and during all this time some, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are – and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
less than 1% of the expenditure.
Debt is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem if the government appropriated a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought it would use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to cut taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines that are almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you get to a figure that makes Labour and Lib-Dem tax on the most luxurious homes seem ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay around £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays around £70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and car stamp, and that’s before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car sign.
I am paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend to believe that money is falling from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes are going.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for a job at the door to door prove this?
Even if 20% of the unemployed would not search, it means that 80% are looking and not finding.
If I am unemployed, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances so much.
Indeed, I haven’t received any news from Employment Pôle for months, which means that agents are more busy with control operations than actually getting job announcements?
I do not see the interest.
It is not the state’s responsibility to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then Pole Employment should be avoided.
What is a sensitive topic?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed do their duties well in exchange for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transportation titles from the users of a means of transport, a service manager or their employees of their work, etc.
Nobody screams at scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had a deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, I had to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I am not a legal expert.
The filing and control is taking over at the moment, while statutory Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern the employees, it is they who pay the co-payments.
Politicians and French unemployed are granting themselves rights that they do not actually have!
It is not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the appreciation of wage labor.
More than just a tweet in Arabic.
In reality, there needs to be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
Saudi Arabia has decided to ban this year’s Hajj in Mecca from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 saw their visa application rejected due to their home country or recent trips.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted varicella in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same attitude.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was common sense, but apparently those “who know” decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
The West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one goes out.
Only medical personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconian measures.
Only last week, people were infected after having contacts with people in West Africa despite taking “all necessary precautions.”
The progression of the disease can be stopped.
It is mainly used by airlines.
Let’s ban them from offering to fly to these countries.
Moreover, customs officers at airports should be trained to spot people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be immediately placed in quarantine.
That he can pass the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to erect into dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that concept.
It has only been 20 years since information has appeared as the given prime of humanity, while religion, derived from the brain, has directed our actions since Lucy.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any case set foot on the Church, only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe this will touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you consider it preexisted in Christ.
Hillel once said, “Don’t do to others what you don’t want them to do to you, that’s the whole Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study.”
Christianity goes well beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "to advance justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is it a return to communism?
The next step is the removal of incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain that hero who overturned moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic.
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I’m looking forward to the next game, Alien or Wasteland 2.
The new Elite game is coming soon.
It is not invented.
Personally, I would choose SOM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I will look.
Of course not at work.
The computer department’s down-joie blocks all web sites.
Is it £30 and then 20% discount, or does £30 include 20% discount?
The PC version is only available for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can’t play it.
I bought it on Steam, so there is no refund.
It’s time to buy a new video card.
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I’d be afraid that one day they’ll delete it from your library if they decide to harass the people who buy it there while they’re out of the planned area.
This is the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So was France in 1940 a “putty land”?
This Nobel Prize seems like a gift.
Do you have to love France of 40, the “strange defeat”?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, you wonder whether Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano, which is already hardly read in French and describes a universe so limited and so egocentric?
I hope the other Nobel prizes are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his right value, if they don’t already know him!
For your part, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso have all their chances.
Let’s see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature.
In 2005, D.
Greetings to the horrors.
Since I’ve been driving one in Iceland, I’ve seen Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think that stuff has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me.
Do you want to be like Superman III's computer?
Hello Dantra, still the hatred?
Hi DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It is Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was Bordeaux.
I have been able to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favourites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving on the return on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday evening we went to a friend’s grandfather’s house to play the Nine Card Brag.
Thanks to a real chance as a beginner, I was able to start with several decent bets.
I hope that when I get 95 years old I will be as alive as him.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of lard on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to bother you, I think you are moving away from the topic.
This famous totality, it prohibits the quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
They immediately alert the arms trafficking.
Either you have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or you have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental sense: the totality of representative authorities, organizations or associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who does not say consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt.
This principle is, in my view, the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the delusion of French society.
If there is no doubt, say so.
Who does not say consent, but what does it mean?
Consent to proximity with ISIS or to the condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to take care of the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically unable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "venge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has grown between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the idea of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron has to laugh.
What are those threats?
The Conservatives are completely distracted by Scotland as they have no seats there.
They can do whatever they want with impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
He will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the “PROMISE” thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are demanding accountability from their leaders.
If the SNP gains 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that is rather the important thing.
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Getting 8% off on account of 85% is not an electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Unionists of Ulster and it succeeded.
However, he is still in the race to be prime minister in 2015 and it has been since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.

As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, it remains to me to read pirated files, books from the public domain or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without hassle.

There have been so many exaggerated, misguided and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be ruled by a kindergarten class full of acid-added schizophrenic children.
It’s even worse than that if you consider Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they remove your comment, but not mine. ;-)
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself a bullet in the foot unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it’s actually shooting yourself a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of retaliation there or whether it simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today’s Iranian and U.S. diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than the c*nneries swallowed by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read in mind of the realistic observations/warnings previously coming from Iran to offer Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “moderates” who seriously fight the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverse ISIS?
Pipeline policy is pushing the world to the abyss and I would suggest those who refer to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending other people’s children to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you consider Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Is there any other religious fundamentalist in power in the Middle East?
I have one in my mind.
The Nuremberg Trial for the Armenian Genocide.
Is it “must”?
Do you realize that neither the perpetrators nor the victims have any chance of surviving?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn’t they be as old as 120 years old?
A bit late for that, right?
Particularly with regard to the CUP triumvirate who planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a paumed place in Central Asia about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.

I don’t know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they’re posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football that is waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has a good understanding of the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it was vampirized by capitalism and today is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can take a look at it if you are in the London area in November: 99psoul will again spend soul vinyles, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story”, but here’s a small article well written and well thought out.

The Palestinians have no partners for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu is not seeking peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in addition, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization over peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli man stole them.
The Israeli representative got up angry and cried, “What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower the guard.
That it dislikes anti-Israeli is obvious, that is not the aim sought ...
Antisionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
This has always been the case since the world has become globalized.

In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of a Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
You are not responsible for the creation of Israel.

Do you doubt it?!!!
Moreover, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Much of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyst billboards written by no other.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It’s just a sequence of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand says certain truths, truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling is becoming more and more common.
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the tabloid absurdities he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he just tells people not to vote and rather cross their arms and ignore the entire political process – but if you look at Paxman’s interview and other articles/videos he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting democratic commitment to that is completely useless, the two parties (at slightly different degrees) ruling essentially in favor of particular interests, multinational corporations and the wealthy, at no time he says to simply completely ignore politics because these parties don’t rule in our name: he insists to say that rather than just voting and disconnecting for five years, people should become much more active locally at the level, organizing political movements, trying to demonstrate, and it doesn’t matter.
I’m not saying I’m necessarily in agreement with its solution (because I think being politically active by submitting its demands can go hand in hand with voting, given that politicians are whirls who will change their minds if they really risk losing the election), but it’s shocking to see all those condescending responses that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells young people not to bother voting and just hope that everything will get better because it’s really distorting his arguments.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people debated what he really says rather than simply labeling him irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large amount of people left behind.
Yes thank you.
The vote was completely distorted.
The inutility of dragging a ballot note into an urn every 5 years deeply annoys me given that my vote does not really matter.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who are accountable locally to their voters.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand’s remarks are not his (written by others).
He’s smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label of “pseudo-chomskyst billeves”.
I am quite confident that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Per that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne do as Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headworms added to the mounting!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russel but eventually became one of his fans and invited him to his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws from a political discourse that has existed for generations but has been marginalized by traditional media — including the Guardian — for generations.
This “fronde” reveals above all to my eyes that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the RDVs of History where business historians have become minority and where the exchanges of specialists have impoverished in favor of ready-to-think condensates such as Sciences Po for press records.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to deal with a guilty, an emissary goat.
They both develop very rational reasoning, but this rationality rests on those emissary goats which are the keys to their thought.
For Foucault, the state was indispensable as the culprit.
This belongs to a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
The problem is solved by removing it.
There is an anarchistic, neo-lib and/or/liberal slope (of the two terms the second marks a tightening of the desire to eradicate the State, the first knowing how to seek the help of the State for its markets) in the sense of at least State/no State at all in Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it cannot stand.
Whoever says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
No support at all.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of its god of the time, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for a Khomeiny’s apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel by this means.
Gauchet makes a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty represented by the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether you agree with him or not, he is an original and respected thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who can’t tolerate passing on to their mantras is pretty ridiculous.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the stance of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellow” I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn’t have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I can’t remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were kind to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
Chinese people think the same about white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-white.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter goes out with a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I’ve been told, Russians mostly have prejudices against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in professions and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the opinions of Australians about the Chinese and Aborigines.
It’s really weird that a stranger tells me I don’t tolerate Chinese, while I’ve met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), I don’t have bad memories of them, all people are worth each other and, in fact, those in London were very kind that’s the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise you do not remember who you meet, all people are worth each other, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what is strange?
That you and the other Russian here talked about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
You always go out with white.
How many Chinese men are with whites, in comparison?
None, because there is a high chance that the parents of these White would physically assault them.
There is no question of the impartiality of justice.
Nevertheless, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left such as the syndicate of the magistrates.
@Marabout: Sorry, but the legal circles are frankly a mark to right.
When it comes to the Judiciary Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativity of the application of laws in the courts, it orders to exclude two obstacles.
That of the observer’s political view as that of the judge’s factual interpretation.
It remains then the mandatory tool of the law to re-focus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all the judicial acts of magistrates, including the prosecutor's office, forces to distinguish between error and the partiality of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not distributed between these three groups.
Pretense and ignorance are not subject to an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from well low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to correctly insert the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
Subject sensitive in proportion to the impairment power which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area considered is that of spoliation* of heirs committed through fraud in the procedure* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession earns €150 million a year while benefiting from the coverage* assured by the quasi-impunity* of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, part of it was in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the aforementioned statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in the many disputes between a genealogist and heirs reluctant to be so spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring these kinds of rational criteria not then an elaborate form of lies?
Prices are completely prohibitive.
Another way to cheat disabled people.
You can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, built tailor-made to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy outdoors as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and bulky tires, could.
As they say, taste and color.
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tankchair looks epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog's crust on a hose.
I’m sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it’s just too expensive.
The ultra-long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a slope for the longboard.
There are mountains that I would like.
Prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put this kind of price on a bike, so “you see.”
The tricycle is useful.
Not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have insurance at their disposal for a reasonable amount.
Only if they are disabled.
The trick is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know we need.
You can’t really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, this is just a draft, it is not planned to be manufactured.
I’m happy that the “long-distance” wheelchair doesn’t come on the market, because apparently there’s no way to drive that dumb stuff.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intense bombing of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been captured by the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-old children have lived all their lives under Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation too, since this blockade imposes a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“The entrepreneurs who work on their projects are diverting some of their cement to the black market.”
This is not the language of wood, but rather of concrete and armed the lady.
References are there to support an argument or fact.
The anti-ionist...
Good cement goes into tunnels.
There is a black market, and it is recognized.
More than two million people have been captured by the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for any person who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-preserved territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) excluded him!
Do not forget that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
I am a Western, so I agree.
Jonathan ...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the population that has chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you have thought well.
Couchsurfing is much more cool than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, without profit.
Many are looking for just one night on Couchsurfing.
So it is to be paid (or at least hoped) in a different way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly with cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
“What does it rent?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It’s an international newspaper now, in case you didn’t notice it.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do business there (which they will refuse).I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it’s really a nightmare...
Have you ever thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and ripped, sunk, etc.?
The pins are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would always be near where you left it.
They were hijacked by pirates.
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our pennies...
Where will you tie it?
Marine Le Pen is wrong.
and populism?
There is no truth except that which reveals the facts.
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 children are leaving school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.

Capitalism is not going to fall.
The high finance, speculates, plays with our companies thus our jobs, with our raw materials, thus our purchases, our foods thus our food, with the structures of care thus our health, with our debts thus our institutions.
They are a threat to our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese of money.
As FH once said, “My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance.”
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild banking minister to better defend the interests of the banksters, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else competent?
You call it how: turn his jacket, drop his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
We don’t really know what Marine Le Pen is thinking.
Where did you see this?
The Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure if Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that neither side seemed sure of the enemy's exact strength.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British armor in the area.
The sea was windy at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle.
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, the Battle of the Malvinas, where, on photos showing survivors being rescued, you can see a calm sea in the middle of the day.
In addition, rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, it doesn’t really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two armoured cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after ceasing fire, and a race of pursuit began.
Leipzig saw something burning, but as he approached, he saw that it was just a wreckage.
The Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, bent and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his projectors to the flag of the ship, the offer to surrender was rejected and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 22:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.”
So, if this is true, the Germans, stabbing in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and so could not look for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy aircraft in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion they unraveled to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to make a way through the many ships of the Royal Navy.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and had cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally caught.
Several votes rise to the UMP to demand that it be registered in the law that an elected person who has been definitively convicted is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing elected people.
Noah, this is a joke.
For this idea, I propose an inscription on the wall of the magistrates' wounds.
When will trade unions be banned in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians (s) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always prompt to tame those who will take advantage of their inamovibility to hinder the actions of real politicians, who really try to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is to the extent of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little banners "sounds for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right unions targeted personalities from its edge and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are completely free.
If, at present, the right defrays the judicial actuality it is simply that it has committed facts that fall within it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with Justice, but not everyone who has been the subject of its attention has been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it should also be remembered that the union of the magistrature that is left is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
The fact that a minister supports trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The trade union you cite may be a minority among magistrates, but its influence is great on the Chancellor, it is no secret.
It is now questionable whether the “mission” of some judges is not more dirty than instructive.
@Gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not officials like others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
And Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello to Katie Waissel.
I think even the most famed dude will realize that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone would accept their offer.
Many have used it as a stepping stone to start a successful career.
One Direction filled the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or went to West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everyone else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Certainly, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most stars who don’t participate in the competition anyway.
There are few people who, after one tube, succeed in making others.
Anyway, most singers/bands can best hope for three albums and one best of.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar frimers who smoke grass in their father’s garage and swing three accords on a primary school level poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes an entirely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because the sacralistic ethnologists present these distant people to us as infinitely superstitious and rotten with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical everyday considerations.
Unless you interpret it in the opposite direction.
Well, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a slightly sacred character?
Our bias is as if reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well-defined and restricted object to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It is the ephemere deco to fill the emptiness.
Nothing more .
Great article thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes the interpretations of archaeologists?
Any other discipline would throw at the threshold of interpretations not at all scientific that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When is it necessary to compare disciplines to make a little laugh?
Because what is true for archaeology is also true for the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your disregard for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies for reconstructing history, understanding societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very ancient and previously archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays, there are so performing technical and scientific means available that the interpretation of excavations is better but can still be challenged by other discoveries!
We are there in full (and old) polemics on shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book “The Shamans of Prehistory”, the increased re-edition of scientific controversy, appeared in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thanks for this very instructive article.
Do men love anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
Is it over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't continue to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canvas?
No, but we are not against a theatre play on that.
We could not watch a musical comedy about it, however, it would be too gay!
I could expect this kind of comment from you.
Mary Whitehouse has come back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, I can suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I am sure you will feel more at home.
He prefers Mickey.
Can I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk and danger.
Instead of getting ridiculed with these childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Then go away.
If these “children’s ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, right?
Did you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or is it the fact that people laugh at it?
There is an amateur video of the crash on the net.
Amateur video of the crash on the net...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the driver.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers it would have left the safety because at the time or another vehicle (defender for example) entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (right TV, pub, money...).
It protects the pilots well.
Of course, I also share that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM makes the SC enter, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restart a chance to beat the English who led then...
You are here on this blog, my dear Daytona.
But it doesn’t matter, I have a little time to find out all of your c***ries.
No, just not .
There have been lots of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of one driver winning at the expense of another.
It is not the FOM that leaves the safety because it is the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of image allows the FIA to avoid annoying questions such as: How does the commissioner shake a green flag in the midst of the intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners clearly sees a green flag, sign that the race can resume normally and that one is under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the regime of yellow flag after the place of the accident, hence the shaken green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The police station right down the crash (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters as well as 100 meters after the crash) shakes the green to tell the drivers to return to normal appearance.
Sensationalism makes the pub sell.
Before I thought that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that, in the end, it’s just for money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, the publicity and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that you don’t really need to worry about is just to continue to scare people so that you can continue to control them.
“When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch the fear” It should be “draw off”, not “cough.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “dredging”.
I wonder if all the people who think that Ebola could spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You give them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist.
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch.
Great article thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules beautifully and solidly this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
I am surprised that the majority of people are talking about this with the opposite optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without getting into hysteria) for the government to take us off when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that if we have to suffer a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for still being in this world almost 35 years later.
At first, it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of going there for years...
A completely useless testimony.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Per this is why one refrains from asking psychiatric patients questions when one has reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it’s nonsense, it’s a subjective testimony that doesn’t matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and the effectiveness of new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
On what do you base your research?
of the ghosts?
Do you put fantasy theories and facts at the same level (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
“Resilience”: the bad word adored by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D’ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in psychics.
Cyrulnik made us hit with “resilience.”
As he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has crafted us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Do you think of Team America?
It’s not a good idea to get the air guard out.
And why then?
It was a great series and it seems that those who come out know it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty, who can do miracles.
But how will they do so that the children hang?
The only solution that comes to mind is the type of pipi-caca humor, which would kill the series.
It was a series for children.
The kids hanged.
Is it a series for children?
UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
Keep your team America.
In a supermarionette?
It won’t be the same if you don’t see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I’m looking forward to seeing this ( being an adult), but I hope it will give a channel the idea to re-release the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since there are one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 p.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-class commercial channels and you can still see it at these times.
In addition, the half-hour episodes now run at 5:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I’m probably a sad 60-year-old guy, but I don’t watch this series every day!
There is no "Mont du Temple" in or under the mosque of the Esplanades !!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all the Israeli excavations underneath and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have allowed nothing to be found.
The temple, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the explanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, stands in the middle of the Omar Mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is the mountain Moriah where Abraham sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and sabotaged it continuously!).
It is also good to show how much the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest Jewish joke: “Praise be to God!”
To boast about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïdes half-disguised on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertisement shows us, as you can see on the photo that illustrates the article.
It is a bit scary anyway.
This picture is a great piece of propaganda.
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer has not taken a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians who are allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who prefer to crush the Jewish faithful below, praying at the Wall of Lamentation.
@Mat, If this photo annoys you, it is right, it is neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be starting to crash, large companies have profited enormously from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they can’t afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding themselves, they gave ever-increasing salaries to the small elite at the top.
You are right, this is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of grumbling and grumbling when someone else is striking, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also show your employer that you are not grumbling people impunely.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
This is because we are in a democracy.
Have you voted for the PTSD?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circulating national governments through secret courts.
That sounds incredible, but that’s exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Settlement Mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It’s only recently that we’re beginning to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you’ll understand what’s being negotiated behind your back.
Winston Churchill said “blood, sweat and tears.”
These are the ones that make excellent outcomes, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will be the car market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th there were trade unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (end of all, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) think of itself as the treasury of France’s eternal values, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, it is reassuring.
Even though it becomes increasingly uncomfortable.
They still miss the union of married men, single men, married women, single men, lost dogs and I don’t know what else.
If you don’t speak French correctly, I’ll sign up.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
Protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough for the defense of categorial interests, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh at the fear of risk on the part of an official.
One can very well imagine a system that guarantees some freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in exchange for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster is guaranteed.
And with the cars being prepared, the government welcomes it.
What kind of security are you talking about?
Ignorance is...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I referred to the military and other officials, since this is the topic commented here...
Remove “through its delegates” in Article 8 of the Preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will be: 8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of the enterprises.”
This is absolutely necessary with the irruption of the information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review.” ?????
The room was there, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it was Joffrey’s wedding that I watched, and I can tell you that some were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey’s wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
The Mmmh cake.
Game of Thrones!
I love the GBBO.
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one has made the kind of “boom, here is my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master!”
Per the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside eventually had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept apart.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears the last week.
I love cooking, but I don’t think I can do that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us super entertainment and encourage us to try new things.
Go ahead to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year’s latest challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really tough to deal with, I don’t know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real defect they could have found was the base a bit dry (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard’s mill didn’t envy, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that many of the challenges in this series seem somewhat artificial due to the time allocated.
There is also the cancer that watches, with the sunshine blows.
We all succeed at the moment.
It’s a bad time for humanity, I hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer that is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to “push out” ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancer.”
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV rays.
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), warming us (less than infrared), modulating our immune system and, apparently, improving our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVC and leaves the UVA and most of the UVB pass.
Do you know that you don’t have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a deceased when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor accuracy that was understood in the commentary, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am an accustomed melanoma, UVs only accelerate its development.
They do not provoke it.
As a proof, not all people with bronchitis have melanoma.
So, when a toubib tells you to avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human being.
Excess is like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV radiation directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we bring it to the mixer?
Or go to the mixer.
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be folded if enough force is applied to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication equipment.
But for us others,
It remains a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied.
This is a Nokia 3310.
Is it already folded?
We make this joke in every conversation.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about the folding I read in the comments today.
It’s hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we can’t see how it could get back there.
So hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................................
Most likely it is a production unit on which iOS has not been installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory-installed test code.
I don’t know how they do those things.
But would they put software testing on everyone?
The photos on Ebay clearly show the absence of the FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
This is a book by excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrials produce in “industrials’ We highlight super u but all the brands and even the small business are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650€ (average salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
Everyone is free to set their priorities where they want to.
Food is one of them.
Do not be angry, I will kiss you.
They are called bobos, or rather boboécolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is the total disintegration of thought-reason.
They are experts in gesture, for example, claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuffery, joining the left-caviar, from which they are sometimes derived, for example by condemning CO2 discharges while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not tolerate this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuffry, so don’t be surprised to often encounter criticism about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I would like to be part of it, but I can’t find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boobies are monoblocked.
Have you understood the concept of caviar?
And you can understand the concept of boboecolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists at all.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fraction of ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently no one wants to look at this giraffe in the face.
She is so badly done that she looks vaguely like a naked female.
You are next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply don’t have any legitimacy to comment because you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin doesn’t know how to draw and seems always obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous without having any artistic ability.
That is “art.”
No, it is a pig.
Emily doesn’t know how to draw.
This is not really a proven fact.
It is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Painting is much more than just representing the real.
If you only look for that, a camera will do the job.
The author also talks about Eminem’s expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the type of drawing you might prefer.
If it is so easy, why not do it yourself?
There is still something to save: riding activities, the number of Republican Guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty obliges to say that France is decreasing its staff, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It is only half encouraging.
Without support, it quickly finds its limits.
A unique approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses, the deficiencies of our defense instrument, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local communities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: this is what I said, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it is really not possible...
That’s exactly what you’re proposing to do, look elsewhere where gabegie is certain.
May all those who have met little or enough with the military thing dare come here to say, eyes in eyes, that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without laughing...
That the same potion be applied to the whole public service and the public finances will go a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why Defense can feel a bit loaded!
Well yes, the economies that everyone agrees to do, they have to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls gremit to murder when it happens to their home, the poor loved ones.
It should be done, but above all that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols to go!
How will the closure of the Valley of Grace weaken our defense instrument in the Sahel?
As for local communities, history repeats itself with every closure of post, maternity, hospital, barracks.
Everyone is for savings.
It is strange, an UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not rejoice in savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most scary thing I’ve ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s the depression of scrolling through his Facebook page and seeing that 80% of his friends started their statutes with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they will make a movie of it.
It will surely be based on hilarant scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus while going to work and only there realizes that his shirt has come back into his pants.
This is not embarrassing, it is completely with.
Not really, in my opinion the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and shake his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years’ absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle for who will have the rights?
I don’t have the internet.
I do not think I can comment.
Without having a computer.
I want to see this movie before I die.
I can't believe this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I fall to the reverse.
I absolutely need to share it with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally get the enlightenment and discover the incredible glare and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
God, it was really zero.
Especially if they are neither female nor female.
I am a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until a new order, we are confiscating the right to save our planet by states playing truffles at every meeting to save the planet.
We, citizens, have to take things into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted on energy, all these beautiful recommendations fled away.
Wind turbines and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All funded by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful at its waste level and in the event of an accident.
As long as the chain is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided of course we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable energy to reduce CO2 emissions?
France is not involved.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GES on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittence.
Replacing nuclear power by renewable wind or PV would be contrary to the fight against CO2.
Christial I am not insulting you I am Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 plus I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I didn’t say it was you who borrowed me ideas I didn’t say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn’t answer what I was saying and like all the right people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany’s current renewable energy program is a non-cost-effective and inefficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the water vapour of greenhouse gases of less effect than CO2 it is true reminds two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes into water vapour and a little into river water.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It’s not surprising, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
This shows your state of mind.
What would have been the same if they had called India a South Asian giant?
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply be to open a Pandora box full of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today’s opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata’s Athletico playing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on IPL cricket and now on football, how could we one day compete with our “noisy neighbors”?
The low cost racing is paid in cash.
It is a pity for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect is manifested only with too cold helium.
It is not a lack of design, but of implementation.
Unlike arianespace, which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state.
And if the rule is the same as here, the state is its own insurer.
Maybe they’re going to pay the satellites in fregates who knows.
This is all the more embarrassing as many media loops only the headlines of articles – and many readers only hold those headlines.
All in all, this creates an incorrect impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly questions the project while it is just a launcher problem.
