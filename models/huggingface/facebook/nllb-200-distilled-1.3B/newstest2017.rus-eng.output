28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco mall .
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, saying: "He was finally getting his act together".
"The body found on the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galizia", the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death was classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a former Boston delivery line cook, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters spokesman said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team working as a close-knit family and he will be greatly missed", the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Luis Galizia said that Frank was initially staying in hostels, but recently "he was finally getting his act together".
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl", Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galizia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt his little brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to make us a meal, to make us dinner", said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of fight.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
"With all the bad things happening to this world, he was that diamond that shone brightly every day", he said.

Italy 's public debt has risen to record levels
Italy's public debt in June 2016 was over €2.248 trillion.
The country's central bank said the amount was a historic high, RIA Novosti reported.
The previous record was set in May of this year.
The size of the national debt then reached 2.228 trillion euros.
It is noted that in the first half of the year, Italy's debt load increased by 77.2 billion euros.
Earlier it was reported that at the end of 2015, Italy's national debt was 132.7% of the country's GDP.

The airport has paid 141 victims of the Domodedovo attack.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviation Fund, which was created by the Domodedovo airport management to help victims of the 2011 terrorist attack, Interfax reports.
According to airport spokesman Alexander Vlasov, two more applications are currently under consideration.
"The fund continues to provide charitable payments to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides all-round assistance in solving the issues", added Vlasov, recalling that a website of the fund was created specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims, containing full information on the procedure for providing charitable assistance.
In 2011, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in the Domodedovo flight deck of a foreign airline.
The attack killed 37 people and injured 172.
Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
An international group of biologists has concluded that the longest-living vertebrate is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, reports RT.
Scientists analyzed the eyeballs of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, over six feet [5 m] long, can live from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that a shark's low metabolism is a major factor in its longevity, leading to its slow development.
Female Greenland sharks only reach sexual maturity at 150 years of age.
It was once thought that the longest-lived vertebrate was the shark's "neighbor", the Greenland whale.
The oldest known specimen was just over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Russian Security Council.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made changes to the composition of the Russian Security Council, the Kremlin's press service said.
Earlier it became known that Putin removed the head of the presidential administration Sergey Ivanov, his successor appointed Anton Wine.
Ivanov will now serve as the president's special representative for environmental, ecological and transportation issues.
Deputy Secretary of the Security Council Rashid Nurgaliyev was excluded from the permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
The council includes Sergey Ivanov, Anton Vaino, the president's deputy in the SFO Sergey Menaylo and the deputy in the SFO Nikolay Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been relieved of his duties as head of the presidential administration.
By the decree of the President, Sergey Ivanov was relieved of his position as head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov was appointed as the Russian Federation's special representative for environmental protection, ecology and transport.
Anton Wineau, who previously held the post of Sergei Ivanov's deputy, has been appointed as the new head of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to transfer to another job.
Should I go to a sanatorium if I have no health problems?
Our expert is the head doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired from work, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanatorium and spa holidays are necessary not only for treatment but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium, a person can check his body and get medical advice on how to live.
I'm sure you'll find that helpful.
"Just tired from work" is an important body signal, and you should not ignore it.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue, and other factors can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90 percent of visitors experience stress.
The most vulnerable are people in large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's best to keep things simple and give yourself a break.
Studies show that 98% of people decrease their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern health resorts offer a comfortable vacation for the whole family.
So if you want to spend a vacation with your kids, you don't have to leave them.
Even the youngest children have health programs that include diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, tests, and treatment.
For example, swimming (many sanatoriums have children's swimming pools), inhalation, special diet, massage, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of treatment is determined by the doctor, taking into account the individual indications and the characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, the sanatoriums usually have a children's club with animators, where children can attend games, various master classes.
Some health resorts even open their doors to guests with babies, provide the necessary facilities for the babies and provide experienced nannies.
The mild winter, long summer, abundance of sunny days a year (more than 300) create good conditions for year-round rest in the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And it's not just in the summertime that your body needs rest.
So you don't have to worry about the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are done indoors and are not seasonally dependent.
In general, it is advisable to undergo a sanatorium treatment twice a year, especially for older people.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Water region, of course, are the healing mineral springs: Slavyansk, Smirnovsk, Yessentucky, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various body systems.
Water varies in temperature, salt content, mineral composition, chemical composition, and gas content.
The doctor selects the water according to the patient's condition.
So, Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effects, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
Essentuckys-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers the sugar level.
Essentuck novena has anti-inflammatory, bile- and urine-repellent effects.
The same effect is also the water "Slavyanskaya".
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If he has signs of hypertension, he picks up less salty water because salts hold the fluid, which causes the pressure to rise.
Mineral water requires a certain amount of water at a certain time and temperature.
Now, in sanatoriums, there are various cosmetic treatments for the face and body.
What types of healthcare based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be found in the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is the salt lake Tambukan, whose mud is useful for joints, spine, and internal organs.
It has anti-inflammatory, absorbent, immune-modulating effects.
These are fitness walks on customized routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
They are popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral spring "Narzan".
There you can also take wine, pearl, iodine, selenium, salphuric acid baths, depending on what your doctor prescribes.
Let's extend the fruitful season.
What can be done to keep the crop going until the end of the season?
It's narrated by Yulia Belopukhova, an agronomist and dairy farmer.
The tall tomatoes need to be trimmed, with the new seedlings removed, the caps cut, and all leaves removed until the last brush with fruit and small flowers are ripe.
All tomatoes regardless of "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with sulfur-superphosphate extract, processed with biopreparations (Driver - to accelerate the pouring and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Bactophyt - from diseases, Immunocytophyte - to increase immunity, Bitotoxybacilin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals used in late summer, only copper coarse, colloidal sulfur and green soap should be used.
We're just watering the plants.
The long-stemmed cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the wall so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, watered with warm water and zircon solution, sprinkled the stem 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to prolong the fruiting period of a pumpkin: cut off old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, and spread fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against the night's cold, place a shelter-like arch over the bed.
Keep the plants open during the day and close them after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists saw signs of Russia emerging from its longest recession in twenty years.
As analysts interviewed by Bloomberg note, the GDP of the Russian Federation is showing positive dynamics - in the second quarter, GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This is the lowest level since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently announced the stabilization of the situation.
Ahead is slow growth.
According to the experts of the Central Bank, the recession in the Russian economy is in the past.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP suggests that the recession is behind us and that slow economic growth is ahead", says the Bank of Russia's bulletin "What the Trends Say".
The regulator's modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter was raised to 0.4%, and the fourth quarter estimate is 0.5%.
As reported by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the decline of the GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0,2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted decline in GDP was 0.2% over the previous quarter.
But the decline stopped during the quarter: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was between 0 and 0.15", - quotes the representative of the Mayor of RIA "Novosti".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters shows that the "bottom line" has been reached.
Among other indicators of a revival in the national economy, Bloomberg cites increased demand for electricity and rail transportation, and a revival in business.
If you adjust for the fact that it's a leap year, it's clear that the 1% increase in electricity consumption could be half due to the extra workday.
Add to that the lower annual average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of cargo transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data, and the plus-minus 0.5% of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by the seasonality", explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 percent, up from 15.6 percent in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has been recording deflation for the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If we look at the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, by the end of August it had strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by the indicators from the real sector of the economy", - emphasizes Yakovenko.
In addition, since April, the Russian Federation has seen an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7%.
The pace of falling foreign trade turnover is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The positive trend is also evident in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4%.
It was lower in September 2015 (5,2%).
Despite the good situation on the labour market, the question of real disposable income remains a matter of wishful thinking.
In annual terms, the figure is down by 4.8%.
This can be a drag on the recovery, as household spending contributes a lot to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy is more than 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's tough policy can also be called a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which is not the best for the real sector.
The negative factor is the insufficiently high level of investment, which is holding back the development of industrial potential.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of falling Russian economy will slow to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015", - says analyst of the Group Forex Club Irina Rogowa.
The process of naturalization of athletes, which was recently launched in Russian football and has become well established in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, is not yet so actively developed in summer sports.
If former foreigners are representing Russia at the Rio Olympics, then most of the time it is about people from the countries of the former Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro we can see the opposite process - a fairly large number of Russians are marching under the flags of other countries.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some people were taken to another country by their parents when they were children, with no choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a spot on the Russian national team.
And someone thought that the best conditions for developing sports would be abroad.
"AiF.ru" found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The 27-year-old German passport says her name is Lisa Reds.
But before that, of course, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, after the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps and take up athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with a hammer.
If she stayed in Russia, she would hardly be able to "push down" Yelena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only compatriot, albeit a former one, in the pole vault.
Her best achievements in this sport are the 2010 European Championship bronze and the 2016 continental championship silver, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are evangelical religious propagandists.
Largely because of their faith, they moved to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
Besides Elena, the family had eight children.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started to take up wrestling in high school.
She showed good results and moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her training at the U.S. Wrestling Training Center under the guidance of another former Russian, Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Championships that year, it was a win.
Before that, she won silver at the 2010 world championships.
Then came bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavl, where she first got acquainted with synchronized swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settled in Colorado.
There, Mary continued her studies.
Soon she was a member of the U.S. National Team and was showing great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, she cannot compete with Russian synchronists, but for America, her performance is the ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Kristina Shaldina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue her artistic gymnastics education overseas.
Until that moment, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly made it into the U.S. youth national team, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She didn't have to fight for the top spot on the world stage, but she made a real breakthrough for the United States, leading the star-striped team to the Rio Olympics.
Another former artist is Jana Berezko-Margrander, who plays for the German national team.
Jana was born in Toliatti.
In 2008, when she was 13, her family decided to move to Germany - where she had more prospects of getting on the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
There, however, Yana managed to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competition in the individual championship.
But two years before that, she had won the bronze medal at the Youth Olympic Games.
Another gymnast, only this time sporty - Irina Sazonova.
If the emigration paths of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, then Irina's family's choice is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student at the Volgograd Sports School.
Naturally, in Iceland, she became the country's champion.
Ira is training in Russia, but he comes to Russia to keep his skills.
She didn't do as well in Rio as she would have liked.
Best place is 40th in the individual all-around.
There is very little information about Maria Ugolikova's swimming skills in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has been living and training in Switzerland.
However, she has been competing for Russia for a long time, showing good results - she even set a national record in the 200-meter butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began performing under a red and white flag.
Her best performance in Rio was 14th place in the 4×100 relay.
To get to the games, she launched a crowdfunding project, which enabled her to raise about 6,000 francs to pay for her preparation for the Olympics.
The 31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batyrov has spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasavur has managed to become a three-time European championship winner, Russian champion, Russian master of sports of international class.
When he stopped being on our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
The talented wrestler disappeared from the sporting scene for several years.
His triumphant return came at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batyrov had already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is known even less in his homeland than Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The fact is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when he was very young.
It was there that Mikhail began to practice gymnastics.
He has not achieved much success at the international level.
His best result in Rio was 40th place in the parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even an Olympic medal in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
Born in Moscow in 1985, Nasta was only 9 years old when her family emigrated to Israel.
There, she continued her synchronized swimming training, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Yevgeny Tetelbaum, Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter is a member of the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the country's champion.
In the same year, he won the world youth championship.
A year later, he won gold at the Singapore Youth Olympic Games.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is also a long jumper and triple jumper.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasavur, who after a long career playing for Russia decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batyrov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the Krasnoyarsk School of Higher Sports, in 2011 even becoming the country's champion.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR volleyball player Yaroslav Antonov.
A year before his son Yaroslav was born, he was named the best volleyball player in the world.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family stayed there permanently.
In 2015, he became the bronze medalist of the European championship held in his new homeland as part of the national team.
Hajiyev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was caught with his family in the middle of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but we couldn't get to that northern country, so we had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to train in freestyle wrestling.
He won the world junior championship, and later qualified for the Olympics.
In Rio, he will be the only French wrestler to compete.
And freestyle wrestling again, and former Russian again.
This time it's about a native of North Ossetia who emigrated to Spain, Taimuraz Freev.
In late December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and currently plays for the Spanish national team.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the country's championships of 2007 and 2008.
Tired of not being able to play for the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last on our list is Artur Biarslanov, a Chechen boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala.
When the boy was ten, his parents took the family across Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been Canadian champion three times, and in 2012 he became world youth champion.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold medal at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children have Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "the Cossacks should be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically".
They must grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But for now, this work seems to be done in a formal manner and I suspect more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positive things that have been accumulated before, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everyone gets carried away, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and utilities continue to be one of the most criminal sectors in the country's economy.
There are encroachments on funds allocated for the needs of the utilities sector from budgets at different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, overcharging is one of the most common crimes in the housing and community sector.
As a result , consumers in the region overpaid energy companies more than 170 million rubles .
Recently, the prosecutor's office of the Krasnodar region has identified the fact of inclusion in the tariffs of unreasonable costs.
And the expenses of the LLC "IV-consulting" (supplies cold water) were 4 million rubles. for the rental of cars at a higher price than the market.
And there are plenty of them across the country.
The people pay the last money for the "communal", and pay in good order - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged with several criminal offenses: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds from crime, abuse of power, and so on.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually performed, but paid.
The businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the criminal justice system, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spent it on his needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents is millions of rubles.
Makarov's scheme of fraud is, alas, typical of Russia.
There's been a wave of arrests and detentions of criminal code officials who have embezzled citizens' money.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, also a former city council deputy, is continuing, who is accused of fraud for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, in Elizavo of Kamchatka Territory, he founded 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the Criminal Court, the other two played the role of settlement-cassava centers, that is, accepted money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not transfer funds to the energy companies, but spent on himself, his beloved.
It's pretty hard to sue in the housing and utilities industry.
Cases don't start, they just drag on.
And "helps" in this extremely complicated housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvorotneva, executive director of the National Enterprise "LCC Control".
We don't have time to make one law work, as we come up with a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, in the field of housing and utilities.
Lawyers themselves admit that housing law is not given much attention in universities.
The prosecutor general's office is also talking about refusing to prosecute, delaying the investigation.
Of the 3,5 thousand crimes in 2015 less than half were sent to court.
The rest of the investigation has been a long one, with one in five suspended for failure to identify the accused.
Often, the deficiencies in law enforcement are attributed to gaps in existing legislation.
The law is there, but the investigating authorities are not in a hurry to start and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases were opened.
Over the past five months , the number of these cases has increased only slightly - 99.
What is a false tenant meeting protocol?
This means that the change of management, financial and other issues are ignored by the owners.
And it also means that normal companies that want to work honestly, not "milk" the population, can't get into the housing market.
So the tenants are down, and so are the small and medium businesses.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in the whole state, - Anton Zharkov, member of the State Duma Committee on Property Issues, is sure.
And now this work is being actively carried out.
These are not just one-off actions, they are a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions are so sad.
Especially in the capital, scandal is not a bad thing.
Why are there no scandals in Moscow in the housing and utilities sector like in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government showed iron will and brought order, - said Anatoly Wyborny, member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Counter-Corruption.
I mean, the personnel issue, the legislative amendments, the legal education.
The management companies are under close supervision, and they've all gone through licensing.
The complaints of the citizens are quickly resolved in the public space (and the appeals of residents, and the measures of reaction are posted on the portal of the government of Moscow).
Many people pay their monthly bills and also carefully monitor the contents of their home.
The awareness of the population about the rights of owners and obligations of resource-providing and managing organizations is very high.
Moscow is also checking the justification of the tariffs for housing and utilities - a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
I guess that explains the calm in Moscow.
So, everything is up to the regional authorities?
Maybe the unemployed should change jobs.
Turkish gambit.
Can Erdogan abandon his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued an ultimatum to the United States, offering to choose between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of plotting a coup.
He said this in a speech to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to abandon support for the "Fethullahist terrorist organization".
This is not the first statement from Turkey calling on the US to change its position.
Experts believe that the rift in Turkey's relations with the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt at a change of power in the country.
"Sooner or later America will have to choose between Turkey and FETO".
It's either a FETO coup or a democratic Turkey.
She must make that choice", Anadolu Agency quoted Erdogan's appeal in Ankara on Wednesday evening.
The Turkish president has once again, but more forcefully, demanded that the United States meet his demand, which he made public for the first time since the uprising was suppressed.
We will remind that in the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, and also attempted to kill the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In all, about 8,000 people were suspected, including teachers and scientists.
Recep Erdogan believes that their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania, USA.
Erdogan's supporters also suggested that the Americans may be directly involved in the coup.
The US denied all claims against it, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement from the State Department came during Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the Turkish president - he insists on his own and also makes demands on his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not name a date for lifting visa restrictions for Turkish citizens", Turkey's EU Affairs Minister Omar Celik said on August 9.
He said Ankara's amendment to the anti-terrorism law, as demanded by the EU, would put Europe's own security at risk.
On August 1, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open its borders to migrants to facilitate visa arrangements with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Another provocative statement was made by Cavusoglu last Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish Foreign Minister did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not receive the support it expected.
The decision to increase defense cooperation with Russia is not a move against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign countries in the defense sphere, - they import missiles", - said Cavusoglu in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
He said Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its own technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"So far Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us and we have started looking for others", the minister said.
Experts believe that all this indicates Turkey's serious differences with the West and the country's reorientation towards the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Analysis, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is playing his game and cannot go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West both in terms of business and in terms of military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance it out by keeping a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see a completely obedient person in this post", - explained the expert to Aif.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the Turkish leader's statements (about non-payment of EU compensation, about the demand for a visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gülen from the USA) he will be pressured.
"Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press him on humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of governing the country and so on", Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information, Alexey Mukhin, believes that the Turkish president will change his view on relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan was taking a very hard line on Russia and was looking for Western favors in every way he could.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There's no guarantee that the Turkish president won't change his priorities again after a while.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
"The Russian government is trying to get the most out of the situation", says Mukhin.
He believes that the main task for the Turkish president today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin so that the United States stops supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, who use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached", the expert said.
The head of the Asia and Middle East Center, Anna Glazova, has a different view.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are now quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally pursues.
I think this crisis in relations will get worse, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the Turkish president, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues regarding Syria, relations with Israel are regulated, there is active political interaction with Iran", - explained Aif.ru Glazova, suggesting that the next step of Erdogan will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
She said Erdogan's policy is a return to the foreign policy approach that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey, with its zero problems with its neighbors, began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively.
The Turkish president has just made very successful visits to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's position both in the regional and international arena", the expert believes.
Glazova believes that returning Turkey to its old relationship with the EU will be incredibly difficult, the question now is whether the EU will start to respond harshly to Turkey, which may open its borders to migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Young doctors strike: Calls for new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors have asked the trade union to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over a new labor contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is going to ask its full council to support more collective protests from early September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the employment agreement with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in a secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government continued to be "persistent in its silence" about the problems that she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: "Given the current situation, the head of JDC has voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues".
In response to the government's silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Board to approve a continuous program of expanded collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute led to six strikes by young doctors this year, including the first general strike in the history of the Public Health Service.
The BMA's chief of junior physicians, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to cancel the agreed terms of employment that the BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to pass during meetings leading up to the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be used for healthcare workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and officially declare an end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the lasting impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked tense, and he barely radiated warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by contrast, has spoken repeatedly about his "dear friend" Mr Putin  five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant otherwise.
But the lingering chill coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that moment was furious.
Mr. Putin has gone on a rampage, accusing Ankara of beating Moscow in the back.
The insult was even more intense coming from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media have been waging a stunning, all-out assault on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be blamed for everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it emphatically.
But St. Petersburg has received an official signal that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its own.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from office last month in a coup attempt.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There's also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard  especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The numbers have dropped sharply by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will of course feel a sense of relief when flights finally resume.
They're betting on a late-season peak in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to resume.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here", as the report in the Vedomosti newspaper said.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her protracted dissatisfaction with the tortuous pace of talks on EU accession and Mr Putin's move to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support for elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit in this glittering palace on the seafront allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of the bad guys": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West, joining forces.
Yet, despite the public displays of reconciliation, the two still have substantial differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents were holding a press conference, they didn't even bring up the subject.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility  and considering the possibility of a total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter, it's definitely better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland .
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's CEO.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been backing away from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer lending brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship aid to international sport, from the Rugby Six Nations Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but not operational.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that will gain more influence  Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and one that our staff will be engaged in, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank".
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their respective populations, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Cup, and it is building the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"It's a good time for us to move the bank brands, because at the core (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we were going to be a great bank for our customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of the customers rather than our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can get those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a win at the Newmarket on the Pride.
Dettori splashes champagne after a double at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori took his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with his second victory of the night on his home track at the Pride, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this milestone in smooth racing.
He is followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iderry and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said: "It's something special".
I'm really excited because my family's here too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket, because this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not Royal Ascot  it's a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from business and very unpretentious.
Dettori gets a standing ovation when he brings the Predisposition after the win.
Two jockeys have achieved this feat in the hurdles: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 career victories.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 wins in his career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it's no wonder he's reached a mark so few have before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical cleverness that sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
He's a great racing pro, and his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and a big race car driver!
And seriously, Frankie's been leading the winners in the UK for most of the last 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a signature fast nipple jump from his horse.
From the fast finish to the fast nipple jump, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth running for two decades.
It's been ups and downs.
Many big race winners, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from a six-month suspension, but he showed tremendous willpower to defy skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not be done for a while. Dettori has said before that he would like to continue competing at least until he's 50.
Putin fires the head of the administration of Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's inner circle for years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the environment and transportation commissioner.
The Kremlin statement said Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vino, has been appointed his successor.
Mr. Wineau, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
He later served as head of the presidential protocol department and the government apparatus, the Kremlin website reports.
During his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important job of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are carried out.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vayno replace him.
Are smiles convincing?
It's a move that has baffled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters for a long time and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin that was shown on state television, both men said the head of the administration had resigned of his own free will.
But despite the camera smiles, that's not convincing to many here  especially now, right before the general election.
So, this is the unintended consequence of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy was met with great skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult, even, you could say, problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was chief of staff for the president for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He's a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB's State Security Service, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term for Putin would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after only three and a half years.
"Think Like a Criminal" star Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was involved in a fight on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on set and disagreements.
I am sorry that this happened", he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to come later, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Think Like a Criminal and have been putting my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of it, but now it's not gonna be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our amazing team, and most importantly, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
The show is set to return for its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: fish landed in Banff Garden
A man from Banff asked for help identifying a fish that had appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sand grains left behind by a water storm.
Baine, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the sight on Periscope in the hope that someone would shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north span and the viaduct to Queensferry Crossing, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four connections between the canvas fans that are now nearing completion at all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the Fife bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It's got 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of bridge.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete has been used to build just this section of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the link between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtuoso operation using extremely precise tolerances for assembly.
A total of about 79 percent of the entire canvas is now in place, with the final section of the canvas being poured into concrete at Rosite today, which means that all the canvas is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first link in every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this coupling is the most advanced piece of architecture.
After installing the last section of the roadbed and connecting it to the expanding roadbed of the North Pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern  or the  side facing the coast.
This was done by pulling the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
It was a large-scale, yet very elegant operation.
It is massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised at an angle of incline of about 3%.
It was elegant because the flaws the team was working on were tiny -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Three men 'lucky to be alive' in the Gulf of Moelfre
Three men were 'lucky to survive' after being thrown from a fishing vessel in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after the team saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety as their boat continued to move.
"We saw their ship circling beside them and assumed the worst", said the lifeboat's steering wheel Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got to the water, a strong wind had blown it away", he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all picked up on a shore-based lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency shutter, but it somehow got detached from the man who was steering the boat when it capsized.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time staring at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
Screen time was originally limited to TV, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and street activity aren't mutually exclusive.
I'm, of course, referring to the mainstream hobby that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app originally created for video games in the 1990s (which later spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many other pop culture phenomena, it all lost its relevance before this new game was available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, gamers with smartphones go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, if detected, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the hobby by breaking away from the couch to search.
In the United States, gaming has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the average person each day.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported in the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, they just see the primary data on how they're going through the levels.
Many health campaigns that tell people to "find 30 minutes", "get off the couch", and "get active every day", have failed because most health messages are boring and come from people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits, too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people outdoors to do what they love.
So, it covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunlight, and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are some boring jerks out there looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone could come knocking.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our physical activity before, they haven't given us the incentive to exercise like this game does.
The novelty will come and the use will fade with time.
However, the success of Pokemon will lead to more games that combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Bayles wins the gold medal in women 's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the commotion.
Simone Biles is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on the springboard.
Free on the log.
Stunning on the floor.
She's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, bridging the gap between herself and the rest of the world in a compelling demonstration under the watchful Olympic eye.
Her total score of 62.198 was far enough away from silver medalist and team-mate of the "Final Five" Eli Reisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Bails of the United States performs on a gymnastics pole during the final of the women's individual all-around competition in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win the title of world champion and fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She was crying when they showed her the final score and her long journey was over by that point.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare track athletes such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds - with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I have ever seen".
One final test was waiting in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the field as between her and the burden of over-expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals would be considered an unwarranted expectation.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Eli Reisman hugging after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual all-around at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bayles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming the beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retiring national team coordinator Martha Caroli.
While Biles insisted she never looked into the future during her long climb to the top, that's not quite true.
Part of her exercise program  the one that includes her signature walkway  is set to Latin American music that would have made her feel right at home on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Amy Burman's mother during a visit to the gym where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost a single championship since the summer of 2013  a streak of luck that should last as long as Biles wants it to.
Although Mustafina had a slight advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
The gymnastics log and the free practice  where Bayles defends the world title  are in ambush.
She again led with 15,433 on the log and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Reisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score  pure formality  and tears appeared around the shiny red with white and blue eyeliner for Biles, when the plan she once recorded in the album of cuts came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revenge for four years ago when she was third, but lost to bronze-winning Mustafina in the tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call "grandma", was way ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, engulfed by a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Bales, the viral tweet from the 19-year-old earlier this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in their car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Leiner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on June 12 when their car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The gunman fired about eight rounds from the passenger side of the car before fleeing in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple homicide is not likely the result of a robbery, as the assailant did not take a wallet or $2,900 from one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look into whether he was connected to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over a four-month period.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of the house", Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown late 1990s Nissan, a black late 1990s BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to release evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were killed instantly.
The witness told police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting targeting an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the casings and extracted the bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old microcephaly child: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixietto loves to sing, play with toys, and of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixietto, didn't know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, "I can't do this".
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not really true  of course you sign up for it", she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
"My first response was, 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Pixietto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still can't talk.
But he's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth is showing the gesture that Edmund made for "please sing to me".
"We are teaching him sign language", Pixietto told CBS News.
But not just ordinary sign language -- she says Edmund invented his own.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of things: genetic, like Edmund's, infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It's too early to say what this will do to the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivo recalls the emotional loss of an uncertain future.
Did I always tell you this would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime prediction because I don't expect anyone to actually tell me.
But Pixivo has some encouraging advice for mothers of children born with birth defects from Zika.
It's getting better.
You know things will get better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and flooding cause rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected to fall across the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have burst their banks and are threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid has already reached affected parishes.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests are being made for high-water transportation, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tanjipahoa's arrival alone has requested tens of thousands of bags of sand.
Flood warnings remain in effect through Saturday for much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3.5 inches could hit the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was in effect through Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comet River near Baton Rouge and the Aimite River near Denny Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set record flood levels last weekend.
Weatherman Alec Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding going downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat, as these swollen rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Ticko River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers are still pulling people out of floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early Friday outside Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming", said Hansford.
She's at my waist level.
His wife told Hansford it was the biggest influx she'd seen in the 48 years she'd lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family members have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three in an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is "spreading fast" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was saturated with rainfall from the environment.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets have led to evacuations in Tanjipahoa and cancellations in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that Tanjipahoa Councillor has reported 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both flooding now.
Parish president Robbie Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets from the floodwaters.
Shelters were opened in the towns of Amethyst and Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They will be able to return home as soon as the water recedes", he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for residents to hand out in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March", said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Emergency Management Chief Rupert Lacy said heavy rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
He said several homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none were reported on Friday.
Kate Towson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amity, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", Towson said, "and it's still pouring down".
Mahaj Brown, 6, "cut open by bullets", survives the shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to his nose, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He was hit hard, his little body was chopped up by bullets", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to be in the first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were reportedly in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car alongside a 29-year-old man in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Investigators are reporting to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several gunmen.
Semi-automatic weapon casings, attributed to different examples of semi-automatic weapons, provided the scene.
It certainly seems like a long battle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it seems there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting", Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldy told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She's recovering, and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Olympic women's gymnastics team, and for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been this dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts who are key players: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The lineup of this team, complete with Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened the presence of black and Latino women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was the surprise Olympic champion, and America gave her a warm welcome.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
And my teammate, Ellie Reisman, won silver.
We're seeing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like that in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Allie and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They're the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroly's coaching.
But in reality gymnastics  is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents who pay for tuition, equipment, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
Most of these gyms are in affluent suburbs that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get the most out of their training, and that's a costly and long-term commitment for gymnasts' families.
Amy Burman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Lori Hernandez's coach, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and accessible gymnastics training for the countless young girls in our communities, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we've already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes in Harlem to more than 15,000 inner-city youths (mostly black and Latino) and trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as endurance to strenuous work, discipline, and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, academic and workplace success.
It's the inspiration that this team will send to thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Exercise is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Ellie, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this major showcase of "Women Power" in winning Olympic team gold and for inspiring so many girls from all backgrounds to be healthy, strong, successful young women.
Junior doctors have begun to call for more strikes after Jeremy Hunt 's rejection of the offer .
Ministers hoped to end the debate on the changes by agreeing on a revised contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to implement the contract, saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would hurt staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to night work and weekends to improve service outside of school.
Dr Ellen McCott, chair of the Young Physicians Committee of the BMA, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied fairly to all doctors".
We've only got eight weeks before the first batch of doctors are rehired, progress is required, and time is running out.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance and sometimes complete silence from the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now to encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, then junior doctors are clear that they're ready to organize more strikes.
The latest strike in late April brought about the postponement of about 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurses' appointments, while nurses and consultants were brought in to ensure doctors were replaced on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing on a revised contract with the heads of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, has urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: "Strikes achieve little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already working at the border, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disruption to patients, nurses and their families".
Over the past two months, we've been talking to the Junior Physicians Committee and working with the Department of Health and Human Services and others to positively address their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate disclosure policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics  such as staff allocation, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, cost of tuition, mutual recognition of curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gaps in medicine  was a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
A £ 2 a day pill could reduce your risk of a heart attack .
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to take the £2 a day drug after authorities recommended it be given to more people for longer periods of time.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is prescribed 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The National Health Service's NICE surveillance service in the UK has recommended giving it to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the National Health Service's NICE surveillance service now recommends giving it to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack strikes about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur when fat accumulates in the walls of arteries and plaques form.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a clot to form, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had one attack are at greater risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, made by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
A draft NICE guidance published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of NICE's Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite effective secondary prevention, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke  often with devastating consequences".
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelar in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By pre-commissioning ticagrelor, we're excited to be able to expand the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor  especially the risk of bleeding  after three years is limited, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
The culture of PC ownership is making it possible for vote-counting fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to a blindness that has resulted in widespread vote-counting fraud in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles lashes out at police, election observers and city administrators for ignoring evidence of election irregularities because of "excessive sensitivity about race and religion".
A former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption czar, said that religious intimidation was so rampant that police should be allowed to put up cordon walls outside polling stations to protect the scared voters.
He suggests that voters take out identification cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At this time, all voters need to do is provide their name and address.
The report even suggests applying indelible ink to people's fingers when they cast their ballots to prevent anyone from voting twice.
We must provide better protection for whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
He calls for giving the press greater access to local council documents and decisions made by informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of a voting scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Luttur Rahman, should be removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "conducted his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of believing Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were questionable or were the result of personalization, where a person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about mail voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are.
His report said: "Evidence has been presented of pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and youth, to vote for the will of their elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that . . . government agencies had turned a blind eye to such behavior because of the over-sensitivity of 'political correctness' to ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric has made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from working with postal ballots to stop the "vote harvest".
The report, before Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent voter registration from being used for immigration and privilege fraud.
The option of requiring voters to show their identity card before voting is being considered.
Use indelible ink on people's fingers as soon as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To systematically check people's nationality to make sure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Ban political campaigners and activists from working with filled out absentee ballots and postal ballots.
Give the police the authority to put up cordon walls around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the polls one by one.
Sir Eric lashes out at the city police, stating that it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal activities", he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt  criminal standard of proof  on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the fruitless "checks for check marks" of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's judgment in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and hidden spread of election fraud and denial by some authorities threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for the bike analogy of Kate and the other celebrities' twins at the Rio Olympics.
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have been going crazy this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turns out to look impressively like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is far from the only athlete vying for gold this summer to boast her own famous double  at least according to social media posts.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities who are on our screens right now, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. men's archery team member Brady Allison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Aside from Kate's twin on the bike path, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. men's archery team member Brady Allison caused a Twitter storm after images of him looking eerily like a Wolf star on Wall Street surfaced.
And in fact, the archer learned about the madness of social media and admitted that he'd heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe except for the vegetation on the face", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment".
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be pointed out even more this year: the striking resemblance between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be an exact replica of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Choir, Matthew Morrison, for years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan  is a "sporty version" of the "Beginning" actor
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer Julia Efimova from Russia not only boasts the same tanned skin and blonde hair as actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, looks like "a sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levit".
The rough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have the same face and eye shapes
Not alone: One Twitter user was very happy that others also saw similarities
Theorizing: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair.
One Twitter user recently took to the site to share her excitement that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical".
In fact, the U.S. soccer star and the actress Dexter have incredibly similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts a beautiful wide smile of her own that resembles that of "Make It Great" star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
The analysis of Byron McDonald of the fourth-place finish in the women 's 4x200m freestyle relay by 14-year-old Ai Yanhan has angered CBC viewers in a live broadcast of the Olympics.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started off like a stinker" and "died like a pig" while swimming.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
You could hear McDonald, who was brought on the CBC commentary team to "diluted her color", saying, "That 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby".
Too excited, started out like a stink, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 , 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing the Canadians to clear the gap from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC anchor really just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'????"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air".
In the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final, Ai Yanhan of China was told, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped a ball, baby".
Criticism on Twitter immediately fell on Byron McDonald, with many calling for him to be fired.
Twitter users couldn't help but wonder how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'This is awesome #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly afterwards, CBC's Scott Russell apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize for the comment about the swimming performance being on the air.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
The media ended by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the statement.
His friend, Scott Russell, had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apology to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network also rushed to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our live viewers and our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her personality.
And yet it was a very inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on live television and tried to clarify his comment, saying he didn't think his words would be interpreted as an attack on personality.
'I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's broadcast of the Olympics.
'I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not her personally.'
'Of course, there was no disrespect meant, and I'm very sorry.'
A Primark buyer insulted a woman who was shamelessly trying on her underwear in the middle of the store.
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped to try on her panties on the store floor in the middle of Primark.
What's worse, she tried on her look in them, pulled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and ended up trying on four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone.
A Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone where a woman tried on knit underwear before putting it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman again "got dressed and left the store without buying anything".
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw".
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own tights and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a safe place to do it... she just stood there, shameless".
"Everybody was staring when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf".
She did the same thing to three other couples before finally deciding there was nothing she liked about it, got dressed again and went out.
"She didn't seem to care who was watching her, or who was thinking about the person who would end up buying the panties she was trying on".
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone is going to take home underwear that someone else has already worn and that hasn't been washed".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items of clothing from the sale after she left  well, all the better".
"I wish I didn't come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find that another woman had put them on and off and they hadn't been washed".
A Primark spokesperson said: "Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August".
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using krav-mag
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizrachi, the master of the New York Crav-Mag Federation, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they're coming at you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to beat a robber with his own weapon.
If you are approaching from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is to turn around so you can see the attacker and "clear the line of fire".
Then you squeeze the gun firmly between your forearm and shoulder before you hit them in the face with your free elbow.
Then you get a knee in the groin, and as the attacker bends in pain, you take the gun out of his hand, hit him in the face with the barrel, and then you step back, pointing the gun at him.
For a gunman who is suited to the front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it out so that the villain cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun out of his grip before pulling back and aiming at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery... unless you're a master kraw-mag... is to give up your cash.
For the guide, traveler Ian Wright takes you through the dirtiest places in Europe with his tongue.
A British traveller has put his immune system and vomiting reflex to the test by licking off some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Travel writer and presenter Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, has been using his tongue on a euro banknote, the railing of the Piccadilly Circus, a toilet button on a train and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is being made into a movie called The Lone Ranger's Guide to Inner Power, yielded some surprising results.
The thought of licking a sink button on a train that thousands of other people use may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health care workers about his increased gut bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing he licked gave him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing his gut strength by traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railings to the toilet button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In a film he made, he said: 'From a very young age I was completely careless about my health and I pulled many things out of the ground into my mouth, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test sample showed a luminometer value of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the newly washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer readings were over 4,000 units, while his just-washed hands showed less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a traveler film called "The Lisuan Traveler's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the amount of bacteria in different places, like the toilet.
In the film, he reported, 'It's close to one of the worst things I've smelled in the toilet.'
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Lisuan Traveler's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Nico Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Valio for Snacks, Juices and New Categories, said: 'We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that would be interesting to look at and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming session that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan".
They say that the concern for gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about food, we wanted to put it in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way: I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.'
Naturally, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite hard.
I'm glad we got some of these licks on tape.'
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked the bacteria to a healthy stomach and intestinal system, and 58 percent said they ate at least some foods with added bacteria.
The bully family destroyed Saltash, the Cornwall townhouse, on the eve of eviction.
A family of hooligans left their townhouse with £50,000 in damages after they were evicted for bullying their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked housing cooperative officials found the property in a state requiring repairs.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the halves were opened, the trash was scattered on the floor and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family is now displaced and believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a movemaker at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he wouldn't be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed because this property is probably going to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad name, and their name has a bad name.
The couple have three sons who have lived at the property from time to time, and police report that the family's reign of terror has included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, arguments and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which could be demolished, found old garbage
Floorboards in a house that used to sell drugs were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw a fight on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner this week after they were given an 11-week extension to leave voluntarily.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One reported: 'They didn't care.'
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet in here - we weren't used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the neighbourhood security group Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and the police were called regularly.
Garbage and old toys were scattered below on the overgrown side of the municipal house .
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her and her family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
It was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been horrific to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have put in to come forward and give us the information.
I hope this development will provide some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all in their early 20s at the time.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms after the eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to clean up the piles of garbage that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, matching accessories and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug with intent to supply.
She said the money went to pay for a memorial for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, Tanya and her partner are reportedly now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were smeared with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't follow the rental rules.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
'It's a message to those who feel they can behave without being accused by the prosecutor, as well as those who are harmed by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost hit the beach.
In Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love to bask in the sun were terrified for their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force has flown incredibly low.
The Air Force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no security risk.
This is the moment when the frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when the low-flying plane splashed over the crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane flying within easy reach of hunters on a sandbar in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers jumped to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but not being able to see what was moving toward them through the clouds.
The incident happened last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of several vacationers who posted videos of the shocking flight on social media, said: "It flew very low twice, and there was a moment when it seemed to break down".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear I had a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me".
Tourists at Aveiro Beach were terrified when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of a P-3C Orion was conducting a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to check them out.
The pilot stated that the plane flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires ravaged mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to conditions of heavy fog and smog from forest fires that have impaired visibility.
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was tasked with spotting fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for public catering for more than a year, but most of the cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
The checks are getting more active, and the business is facing fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system - a system of risk analysis and critical control points - has been mandatory for food producers and carriers, as well as companies in the foodservice sector in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CC).
The inspections of businesses by Rospotrebnadzor on compliance with these norms in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials are only issuing fines for some violations of the regulations (see "Document list"...).
Failure to comply with the regulation will cost the company 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASCP was developed in the United States in the 1960s as a system for identifying and preventing food-related risks.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
Now, the system is used in all food factories, not only in the United States, but in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASCP has been operating in the territory of the TC.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HASSP requirement appeared in the technical regulation of the TC in 2011).
However, both businessmen and officials admit that most companies have never even heard of this standard.
We, unfortunately, have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, not to restaurants, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone's trying to make up for lost time.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is late August - early September.
But they will not cause a huge demand, since their target audience - families with children - are already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agents sent a letter to the government yesterday asking for permission to charter now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting a quality and affordable sea vacation is insoluble, as most accommodation facilities in the resorts of the Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea are already booked until the end of September", the authors of the letter note and stress that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian sea tourism products.
As reported in the North-West regional branch of the Russian Union of Tourist Industry (RUS), if the aviation departments of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding of when charters will resume, but it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the planes could fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly develop their programs and agree with airlines on the flights they need to fly", says Pavel Rumyantsev, deputy director for communications and international projects at the Northwest Regional Office of the RST.
He said the possible resumption of charter flights is good news, but it will not affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or are spending their holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are mostly purchased by solo travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously", says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract many tourists if it makes very budgetary offers now - 50 to 60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours", says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, you can't expect much of a buzz - most of the travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the hype should not wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season", says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is a positive news for the next season", agrees Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NDFL of compensation payments established by law within the limits of the approved norms related to compensation for damage caused by disability or other damage to health.
Milk is provided to workers with harmful working conditions according to the established norms of Article 222 of the Russian Commercial Code.
The rules and conditions of issuance are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No 45n.
According to this document, free milk or other equivalent food is provided to workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors at the workplace.
Based on these norms, the Russian Federal Tax Service in the letter came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 of Article 217 of the National Tax Code of the Russian Federation, income in the form of the value of milk given to employees in the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions is exempt from taxation of NDFL in accordance with the Norms and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow's GazStruibank has been stripped of its Central Bank license.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out bank operations from the credit organization "GAZSTROYBANK" registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GAZSTROYBANK has been pursuing a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of cash in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and accurate reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to the credit organization having grounds for implementing measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in conducting suspicious transit operations.
The bank has a temporary administration until the time of appointment as a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the credit union executive bodies are suspended in accordance with federal law.
GAZSTROYBANK is a participant in the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On Insurance of Deposits of Individuals in Banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the report, on August 1, 2016, GAZSTROYBANK JSC was 335th in the Russian banking system in terms of assets.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria
Qadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Tasneem Akunji's lawyer said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, weeks ago.
She is believed to have died in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"Hopefully, the only benefit of all this - as a tombstone and a testament to others that these are the risks of going to a war zone - is to dissuade people from ever making the same choice", Akunzi said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a Supreme Court nominee if elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is confident that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as president.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's nomination, just as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the man who can replace the last Supreme Court justice, Antonin Scalia.
Reed said on a conference call Thursday that he predicted Clinton would pick Garland "with some degree of confidence".
Reid's rep later said he hadn't spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland, and was just speculating.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland  Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reed said Republicans who block Garland's nomination are "supporters" and "helpers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for office.
Treats claims that erotic calendars are for 'women as well as men'
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're aiming to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muses.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with its many nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
"We need to return to a perpetual and classic nude figure display where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be handing out notes about unscrupulous online stores.
Moscow is going to release a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
The agency is reportedly preparing a memo to help citizens choose the right online store and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The brochure is designed to cover a number of topics.
These will be general information and the legal framework, the rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect your legal rights.
The application will give recommendations on how to correctly make a claim and so on", - said in Rospotrebnadzor.
The memo is still being worked out.
It will be posted on the website of the Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, and it is planned to publish a printed version and distribute it to the people of Moscow.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has released a statement naming the second suspect in the sabotage in Crimea.
The arrest of persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Mr. Evgeny Alexandrovich and Mr. Andrei Romanovich.
"They all confessed", the statement said.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporizhia region, Yevgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt at interrogation.
The FAS is going to fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the website of the agency.
"The fine for Google for violating the antitrust law was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine soon", - said Deputy Head of the FAS Alexey Docenko.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies the Google Play app store to smartphone manufacturers that are sold in Russia only if other corporate applications are installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search engine that should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates part 1 of article 10 of the Federal Law "On protection of competition" (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the directive will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The law "On protection of competition" must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations in particular", - said the head of the Department of regulation of communication and information technologies of the Federal Security Service of Russia Elena Zaeva.
The agency suspects 16 Russian stores of collusion.
The New Bookstore chain was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide".
The Novy Knjiga chain has been fined for selling Stace Kramer's book 50 Days Before My Suicide, Moscow news agency reports.
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents".
The Ostankaya district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a fine in the form of confiscation of 49 copies of printed products seized by the Rospotrebnadzor.
A source at New Book confirmed that it was a work by Stace Kramer.
In March this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow were checking for the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow, the evening of the memory of Ernst Unknown will be held.
In Moscow, a memorial evening will be held for sculptor Ernst Unknown, TASS reports.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Literature.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States in person.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to remember him in their homeland", - said in the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It was noted that this was important for the sculptor's widow, Anna Graham, and his friends around the world.

Earlier it was reported that relatives of Ernst Unknown planned to hold a funeral for the sculptor in New York, presumably until August 14.
The end consumer of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men like vinyl.
And unless you're rushing to clog the comments section with rude insults under the pseudonym Not All Single Middle-Aged Men, that statement is based on factual evidence.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of the record is not due to a boom in millennials wanting to get into the material, but to a nostalgia for middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely to be affected.
It 's also not just an act of amateur gathering - it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog was a television news story, the camera would follow me as I walk down the middle of a busy Soho street, in a modest gray suit and gesturing loudly before a stop, folding my arms and saying something impressive like, "Okay, let's see".
Okay, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt  hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops now fill buildings once occupied by independent vendors  a few music shops with fantastic specialists still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to pause for the next scene, where I'm standing close to different people in some of these stores and trying to estimate their age and emotional state through observation.
A native of Glasgow, Stuart, 55, who I followed from Sister Ray (counting: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), in London for half a day to hold a meeting, and walking around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask you?
"I suppose so", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, pictured above (he emailed me a photo, I didn't follow him home), line up the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles is partly due to his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn't afford when they first came out and buy back items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I buy is late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
That's my weakness.
Waze, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
He did, however, notice a new wave of people being influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old records.
From the conversations I had, people were getting rid of their collections, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records", he says.
This may explain the boom in vinyl revivals of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the records?
You only have to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community for like-minded people.
According to Waze, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and prefer to retreat into the familiar record envelopes, items that evoke memories of a restless youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling in the blanks or having material things as a kind of comfort", says Wes.
I'm a collector myself, so I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to keep your head busy.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record rack.
An ICM poll in April found that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album in the last month had not listened to it.
The survey also found that 41 percent have a player they never use, while 7 percent of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point in the news story, I would probably look seriously confused, flipping through a shelf of Bosanov's collections.
The "trophy" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, noticed.
"Someone came up to me recently and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of the ingredients, less of the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
They're younger people, not older, just under 20 who are just getting used to it.
Fopp, who now has almost the entire floor dedicated to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less laid-back than in the aforementioned stores  the latest synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, breaks through the stands  it's nice to see the diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but traumatic trauma is hard to pin down from standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked through Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available for sale.
She looks at the goods, not spends the money.
She doesn't make much money, she says, so record collecting isn't a good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is easy, but the beauty of vinyl is ... " - she falls into dreams with a sigh full of love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unique.
My last stop is the store that is said to have helped to create a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Fashionistas.
While I create the illusion of looking at jeans-rimmed shorts, I watch a group of teenage girls gather around a Polaroid camera every minute before a father and daughter start discussing buying a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern and classic, a must-have for any medium collection.
No one looks at them, maybe because they're just ornaments, some so high up on the wall that it's impossible to touch them.
This is a real artistic vinyl.
But considering that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho slums for a while longer, there's hardly anything to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the population that is more likely than the majority to have more time and money than the majority is the one that spends the most money on luxury items like vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's findings are accurate, at least for Soho record stores, they don't rule out the existence of a huge number of female vinyl collectors and lovers that exist in real life, in record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working all day at school or in offices.
But they clearly don't spend Thursday mornings wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, flipping through records and avoiding the gaze of a nasty 30-year-old fake news anchor who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark  longest-living vertebrate  video report
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says that the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years of age and five meters long
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle Camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
At court hearings this week, Calais authorities said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell 50 cents of tea or simple dishes for a few euros in homemade restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais has said that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide free shelter and food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to evict the people who ran 72 handicraft shops, but said the problems of Calais prefecture "were completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions".
He said the spaces provided a quiet meeting place for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites that was threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book Children's Cafe at the camp, which is a non-profit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes and shelter counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing it "would be a disaster for these children, some as young as eight".
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle Camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest ever - after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
The libraries of the neighbourhoods invite young people to participate in educational programmes.
This week, the library branches will hold meetings dedicated to the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physical Activist.
The programmes are aimed at children, so they will be mostly in the form of games.
Today, August 10, the library-branch No. 2 in the Zaliynnyny neighborhood invites you to the cruise-presentation "My town is small".
On August 11, the library-filial No. 1 will hold a local science hour "I live in this city, I know this city".
In the library-filial No. 2, a multimedia lesson "The past fate of the native land" will be held on the same day.
And in the library-filiality No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, the library-filial No. 3 will hold a game program "Fizkult-hello!" for children from the northern neighborhood.
Britain stops for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold
Great Britain's impressive Rugby 7 series was crushed at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were completely beaten 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in ball possession, passing, evasion, supporting play, running lines and brute force to win gold  their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver  Britain's third in a day  and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic Rugby 7 tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The Boks' painful beating, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, could come back to hurt them in the final.
But despite everything, Fiji beat a team of 15 in this form.
It may be some consolation for Britain but probably not that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former England's Wimbledon chief.
It was some trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is staggering.
Fiji started off brilliantly, for fun, defending the UK's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like running into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osei Collinasaw went into the corner.
With four minutes left on the clock, Jerryr Tuwai added another touchdown on the right flank, which was accomplished.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant interception kept mountain man Leon Nakarava from scoring a third, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner, and Great Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after the resumption and the clock was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Watemo Raovo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept Great Britain and stormed the line to score.
The delivery made it 29-0 at halftime.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby sevens while the UK was still mastering the craft.
Which is pretty much it.
Great Britain were making massive substitutions halfway through the game and they clogged the Fiji dam... for four minutes, which was good by first half standards until Joshua Tuisov passed after some brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for Great Britain, scoring a touchdown in the left corner to make it 36-7, but the game had long since gone the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to marvel at the joyful approach of Fiji.
Mata William has embellished a Fijian cake that didn't need embellishing, another last-second attempt.
The whistle blew, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell to the ground, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in their semi-final, while Great Britain edged South Africa slightly in the tight semi-final by one try each  difference British implementation.
Kyle Brown leads the Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great footwork, broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant final attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15th-seeded Anthony, secured the victory and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing competition by a trainer's battle with cancer.
There won't be any more exciting gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy ascents in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two rowers, there were three voices in this boat, coach Robin Williams' echo was always there as they strove for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first women in British sporting history to reach such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, after all it was their 39th unbeaten performance, again unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, not fully reflecting the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold was a battalion of willing hands rowing to the ever-increasing victories that matter, and there are no hands that have played a more important role than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous business.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did it.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your vision of the future a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December of 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014 in the offseason, keeping the schedule gap to a minimum, if that's the right word to use in circumstances like these.
I needed to get paid, so I needed to get better fast.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward  20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said it was enough a few steps.
That's how it starts.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after the win, their first thoughts were of Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, trying to get over his own feelings.
Stanning, a captain in the artillery regiment who served in Afghanistan, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe a little too much, but it means so much".
It just goes to show how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin did, too.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams started to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in their reserves.
We were in a really bad place.
Helen was like, 'stay in the loop, stay in the loop.'
It's very important not to get caught up in it.
We got off to a good start, and at the same time, we weren't trying to do anything awesome.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just hoping we could row well and go out and win this race, which we did.
It'll take a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at a wedding next month, her own with TV adventurer Steve Baxall.
Right now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better", she said.
The government extended the deadline for destroying sanctions products
The government has extended the deadline for destroying food products banned from Russia until the end of 2017.
The relevant resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions over the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban has been extended several times since then, and now it's in effect until December 31, 2017.
Some types of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein are prohibited from being imported into Russia.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
Recycling of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sale.
The Hunt for the Prohibited
On Friday, rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, bringing rain and lowering the air temperature.
The temperature will be up to 25 degrees Celsius in the afternoon.
So, on Saturday night in Moscow will rain, thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 15 meters per second.
Rain is expected with thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 12-17 m/s.
Thunderstorms are also forecast in the Orel, Kursk and Voronezh regions, reports "Dni.ru".
Next week, rain is unlikely.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil violated WTO rules.
The import tariffs are higher than the obligations Russia assumed when it joined the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against Russia", the organization's official website said.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the EU had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "were systematic" or "comprehensive in nature".
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia's actions, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Ukrainian government.
In May, the Financial Times reported that the US's conduct in resolving disputes at the WTO undermines the principles of discussion adopted by the organization.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members made similar statements after the Americans refused to confirm South Korean judge Chan Sung-hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now has 162 member countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
The President 's Administration has a new head
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Anton Wine, former deputy of Sergei Ivanov, as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has made changes in the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vino said during the meeting that he considered important the anti-corruption work that he began to carry out as head of the presidential administration Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the reshuffle will not change anything in principle in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head who worked in the presidential administration for a long time has effectively built up the AP.
He was replaced by Deputy Chief of Staff Anton Vayno, a man who knows the specifics of the job.
Poland has agreed not to buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish state oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years gas supplies from Russia may become unattractive for it due to reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice president of the Polish company for finance Bogusław Mażec.
His words are reported by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply routes for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway", said Majec.
At present, Gazprom is the dominant supplier of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas in the first half of 2016, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The Russian gas giant's share of PGNIG's purchases rose to 49.8 percent from 40 percent a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the Polish anti-monopoly agency did not approve the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
A month earlier, Poland had left Gazprom with a request for 11 billion cubic meters of gas to be supplied through the Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by the deputy chairman of the board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of "Northern Stream-2" will be held in 2017, and in the fall of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom was not planning to take any action in connection with the intention of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for gas supplies from Russia after 2022, the company's deputy chairman Alexander Medvedev said.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles increased gas purchases from Russia by 42%.
The deputy head of Gazprom added that the fact that PGNIG has filed a complaint with the Stockholm arbitration court does not mean that the negotiations have stopped.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to reduce the purchase price for Russian gas.
The Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, said that the Polish authorities decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for gas supply.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, said that his country could abandon supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
"North Stream-2" envisages the construction of two lines of a sea gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year from Russia to Germany through the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine's border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area", he said, according to RIA Novosti.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
The monitors were monitoring the situation at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at the Ufa airport has appeared on the Internet. It rolled 400 meters off the runway and crashed into the left wing.
The video was published by the "360" television channel.
The accident happened at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "CrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no injuries.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
The Ufa airport is operating normally.
The Volga Regional Transportation Investigation Directorate is investigating the cause of the plane's crash.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All sides in the conflict deny using chlorine, but UN Special Envoy for Syria Stephane de Mistura says the incident is indisputable.
The announcement comes ahead of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to start in late August in Geneva.
UN specialists have launched an investigation into reports of chemical weapons use in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first reports of a terrorist attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
The opposition claimed that the area where a Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before was hit by a bomb, but Moscow called the bombing a bombing.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry blamed the incident on the opposition group "Harakyat Nur ad-Din az-Zinki".
It soon became clear that there were two bombs loaded with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by one of the victims to the BBC.
"A few minutes later, I started to smell gas, burning my eyes, and breathing became difficult", the newspaper quoted an eyewitness as saying.
At least seven people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, told reporters: "There is a lot of evidence that this really happened".
The prohibition on chlorine use in military purposes is enshrined in the Chemical Weapons Convention .
Although all sides in the Syrian conflict deny using toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists documented 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition".
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the daily shelling of its districts and the terrorists' efforts to prevent the evacuation of the city.
The UN is expecting Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in the fighting, Reuters reports.
The current three-hour daily silence is considered "insufficient to help the nearly 2 million civilians trapped".
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egelen, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed to get aid to the city and evacuate the sick and wounded every week.
"We have to ship large loads from a convoy of trucks in an area where roads are practically destroyed and those that remain are mined", Egellan said.
Consultations in Geneva between U.S. and Russian officials on a "humanitarian pause" are continuing.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
Amid the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, Russia announced on August 11 a three-hour ceasefire, which will be in effect daily from Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Russian Defense Ministry was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow to withdraw the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
A series of bombings at Thailand's resorts killed four people.
Multiple explosions struck in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
The attack killed four people and injured 19.
The blasts were centered in Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, no Russians among them.
No terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country's interior ministry has said the Islamists are not involved.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of bombing.
According to preliminary information from local police, the scale and nature of the explosions suggest that they were aimed at the country's military leadership.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in Phuket and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that showed development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the attack have been arrested, police Colonel Krisana Patanacharyen said.
It is too early to say what the targets are, he added, but the country's interior ministry "is confident that they are not linked to international extremist groups".
It is too early to draw any conclusions, Mr Patanacharyen said.
But we know for a fact that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they're actually local sabotage, and we're trying to establish the identities of those behind them.
The blasts occurred on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Secret.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to police general Sithchai Srisocharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely within half an hour.
They were hidden in trees on busy streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The identities of the other victims are unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen are among the dead.
There are no Russians among the victims of the blasts, the press service of the Russian tourism authority reported.
Local experts also link the blasts to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported a new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission appointed by the military junta to draft a constitution.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament is appointed entirely by the military and has a significant role in electing the country's prime minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time at the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup led by Army Commander Prayut Chan-ocha took place in Thailand.
The army's move, he said, was prompted by the ongoing political crisis and lack of progress in talks between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed curfew and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok got into a state of emergency
The Thai government led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred near the Victory Monument in central Bangkok, where one of the main protests was taking place, injuring 28 people, five of them in critical condition.
The explosions were caused by unknowns on motorcycles.
Authorities have stepped up security in the capital and deployed military forces to protect protesters.
The Dry Lodge has begun to develop conditions.
As it became known to "Ъ", the government was asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction on the gold mine Sukhoi Log with the preservation of two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed to exclude companies where 25% or more belong to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not be at least 25% state participation.
Industry participants are not waiting for the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not willing to risk a complex and expensive project.
The auction could be announced in August, and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has submitted to the government a draft order and conditions for the auction of the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, the Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation told "Ъ".
The bill was introduced Wednesday night, one of them said.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed to Kommersant that the project has been submitted to the government.
A spokesman for the deputy prime minister, Alexander Kloponin, told Kommersant that the project had not yet been submitted to the official's office.
"The auction can be announced as early as August, immediately after the government's order, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can be held as early as October", the Ministry of Natural Resources says.
According to the "Kommersant", the project retains two key requirements for potential participants, which were written in the version that was sent to the ministries and the FIOI in July for approval (the "Kommersant" has).
The first is that the applicants have at least 25% of the state's equity.
The second is the denial of access to the auction to companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the understanding of the FZ-57 about foreign investment in strategic companies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law, as already written by "Ъ" on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log is a federal mine (reserves over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on details until the government's order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "Ъ" in the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergey Yerochenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with "Rostech"".
The source of the complaint did not say who lobbied for the restriction of foreigners.
"But it's in the spirit of the times: not to give up control of Russia's largest gold mine amid Western sanctions", said a source familiar with the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskaya on August 1 stated that foreigners "can go to the consortium", if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The interlocutors of Kommersant believe that it is unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for the Dry Log in the industry is considered to be the consortium of the largest gold mining company of the Russian Federation PJSC "Polyus", controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and "Rostech".
As "Ъ" wrote, in July partners created the joint venture "SL Gold", where "Polus" has 51% of the shares, the structure of "Rostek" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, while Pole said it was "undoubtedly interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competencies and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions", - added in "Pole".
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the Russian government, Kommersant sources said.
The possibility of participation in the development of the Dry Log was stated by Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Russian Union of Gold Industrialists, Sergey Kashuba, in December 2015 estimated the investment in the Sukhoi Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are discouraged not only by the volume of investment, but also by the complexity of the project: serious exploration of reserves and technology for working with complex ores are needed, Kommersant's industry interlocutors explain.
The largest M&A deal in the pension market has started - KIT Finance Pension Administrator has launched the process of merging four NPFs under its control.
As a result, a NPF will be created on the basis of the "Gas Fund for Pension Savings" with a total of about 373 billion rubles.
The start of the procedure of merging four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofund", "Heritage" and "Gazfond Pension Savings" - yesterday announced the owner of 100% of the funds of the LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
"The reorganization is being carried out in agreement with the Central Bank, subject to the requirements of the existing contracts", the company said in a statement.
The fund is managed by the Pension Savings Gas Fund.
As the NPF's director general Oleg Bialoshickiy notes, the funds' merger allows for several tasks: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the approximate completion date of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, the NPF "Gazfond Pension Savings" will become the largest player in the OPS market.
According to data on March 31, the pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reporting on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and the NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the band itself launched much later than its competitors.
For example, the future NPF controlled by the O1 group absorbed Staalfund earlier this year.
Currently, this combined NPF is joined by the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"The unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems", - says the general director of the NPF "Future" Nikolai Sidorov.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has been underway since April in the pension group "Safmar" - the NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regionfund" should be merged into the NPF "Safmar" before the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the Trust National Fund.
"The combination of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses", - said in the pension group "Safmar".
The pause in fund mergers that KIT Finance Pension Administrator has endured could be due to several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, the NPF could not buy back more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively invested.
After amendments to the Central Bank's resolution in March this year on a number of issuers that meet the regulator's requirements, such restrictions are no longer in place.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought by one major player", - says Yuri Nogin, director of the rating group of financial institutions of the ACRA.
Several executives of the top 15 NPFs by assets cite the division of spheres of influence and, as a consequence, personnel appointments in the single fund, which had to be agreed by the owners of the group, as another possible reason for the pause.
Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment yesterday.
The GazFund also did not respond to the Kommersant request.
Although fund consolidation is a time-consuming and inexpensive endeavor, it will be justified in the long run.
As noted by the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov, "Gazfond Pension Savings" has fewer outflows, the merger will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, the more successful experience of the NPF "KIT Finance" and "PromaGroFond" in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software, will be demanded.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is not feasible to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, managing director of corporate ratings at "Expert RA".
"The effect of reducing duplicating functions will definitely override the possible costs of merging", says Mr Mitrofanov.
The cost of combining the four funds is estimated by Sergey Okolesnov at 30-50 million rubles .
"The costs of maintaining four such funds amount to about 400 million rubles a year, and if the budget is consolidated in the medium term, it will actually be cut in half", Mr. Okolesnov said.
The best Disney movie "Pete and his dragon" has been released in Russian cinema.
The beautiful scenery of New Zealand, the tame dragon, the heart-rending history and the country songs are enough to make you believe in old-fashioned magic again, says Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon who became a human baby and a tender nurse and a loyal friend.
Pete names his buddy Elliot after a puppy from a fairy tale, plays catch-up with him, and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he's grown up and in a belt, and he's no different from another clever woodsman, Mowgli.
This is how Pete is discovered by the red-haired female warrior Grace (Brice Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively clears the forest.
Now she must not only believe in the dragon, but help save him.
Pete takes an accelerated course in being human surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, have a moral code at heart and smile more dazzlingly than any advertisement.
No character looks or acts so terrible that the viewer will actually hate or fear them.
Even Gavin, who has hunted down an unusual inhabitant of his forest, is far from an incorrigible villain.
A huge, furry dragon turned out to be nothing to fear, with a good bulldog face, airline-sized wings and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon makes a funny roar, purrs, even growls, and, fortunately, does not speak, but it always wants to be stroked, which makes it advantageously different from all known cinematic dragons.
Elliott's visual appearance and his manner of holding on provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only the young viewers but also the adults start to cry desperately.
Surprisingly good is young Oaks Figley as Pete, torn between a potential family and a true friend.
And Robert Redford is brilliant at giving away the canonical grandfather that literally every child would love to have.
How did director David Lowery manage to make a fantastically cute remake of Disney's forgotten 1977 film "Dragon Pete", mediocre from nose to tail and remembered only as a mix of animation and game-movie, and make it the most soulful movie of the summer?
It was a miracle.
In his painting, Lowry took only two things from the original: Pete the orphan and the dragon.
There's still the musical numbers and most of the weird jokes.
This good fairy tale borrows from Bambi, Alien, and many other heart-warming children's pictures.
Disney continues to successfully expand its gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon isn't as stunningly beautiful as The Jungle Book, and it doesn't have the sleek villain that Kate Blanchett had as the stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film is no less successful in helping people believe in miracles and goodness in the best of Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magical castle will be given to director Lowry once again for the film adaptation of Peter Pan.
The same team behind "Pete and the Dragon" David Lowry and writer Toby Halbrooks have joined forces for a new, ambitious project about an un-adult boy based on James Barry's eponymous tale.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov is facing a new charge
Lawyers for RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, who is accused of organizing the activities of an extremist organization, said that the prosecutor's office found flaws in the case of their client.
We only heard from investigators yesterday that the prosecution made such a statement.
We were scheduled to attend a court hearing on the question of limiting the access to criminal case materials, but the hearing did not take place, and the investigators informed us about the prosecutor's submission", - quotes RBC the words of lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said the prosecutor's office had pointed out to investigators that the qualification of the case and the materials collected were inconsistent.
Now the investigators will have to fill in the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze said.
As reported by "Ъ", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded from the accusation of the RBC journalist the formulation of "shaking the political situation towards instability" and "overthrowing the government by illegal means".
"Kommersantboscosport" correspondent ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic Village, inspected the Russian national team's home, dined in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
It seems like life doesn't stop for a second.
Even at night.
The final run sometimes ends before midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
And there is a constant settlement and eviction of the villages, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, while others, on the contrary, just arrive here.
And at 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations are pulling up to one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational issues, - says Igor Kazikov, head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team. - Despite the fact that the house in which we are located is, consider it, exemplary - it was commissioned one of the first and demonstrated to all inspectors, even in it there are some shortcomings.
I'm sorry, the hot water is a problem, the toilets are a problem.
We've been fighting for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cleaners came, but they just sprayed some stuff on the floor, that's all.
The floors, you see, are innovative.
They say you can't wash them humanely.
We know these floors. Laminate floor.
So, we got a change of cleaning company, and now we're good.
The Olympic Village is a sort of South Butovo, a sleeping area, surrounded on one side by mountains, on the other by an impressive moat, in places flooded with water.
And for reliability, there's a six-foot iron fence that automatic rifles walk along.
In total, up to 17 thousand people can be accommodated in 3604 apartments in 31 houses.
One of the 18-storey buildings has a huge Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our national team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems are most pressing for the national team.
The registration desk has two signs: "Please do not throw paper in the toilet!" and "I will accept the badge as a gift.
The bar is drowning in the booklets.
Their cheerful coloring contrasts with the titles of the booklets: "Infectious Disease Alert for Travelers to Rio de Janeiro", "First Aid for Drowning, Stroke, and Stroke", "First Aid for Burns, Heatstroke, Fractures, and Bleeding".
The lyrics inside are generally encouraging.
For example, "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone is happy.
Of course, the Russian national team has a medical center, which is ready to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the house, including relaxation and sports massage.
Across the street from the medical center is our delegation headquarters.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!"
And, of course, the lyrics:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only the God-fearing will believe in them.
Let us be fewer, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And to add to the excitement, the announcement reads: "Dear Brothers and Sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is carried out by the proto-Ierech Andrey Vladimirovich Alexeev.
You can order the chapel and other things over the phone...
In general, there is a meditation and religious ceremonies center for representatives of all religions in the village.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, are in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Because of the elevator's load from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which are recommended for use in case of fire.
And in the darkness, he tripped over the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of a new cleaning company.
I guess, in their desperation to wash innovative floors, they decided to have a quiet hour right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was to meet an old friend, Vitaly Dubko, the coach of our batus, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his student, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
There is nothing to complain about, - shares the impressions of the award-winning coach of Russia. - We live in two, the beds, of course, are almost in the corner, but it is not critical.
The toilet's one on four, but it's spacious.
The closet, of course, is ridiculous, made of fabric, not trustworthy, but things can be put.
"No, you're pretending, they're out of tea!" says tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom I met in the main dining room.
It is called the main one at least because it is a space of 2,7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive at the same time 5 thousand visitors.
They give out over 60,000 servings a day for free.
The menu options are "Best of Brazil", "World Cuisines", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta products".
The last option, I guess, is very popular with our volleyball players.
And I didn't find any soup in any of the units of the giant restaurant.
"What kind of soup?" says Kuznetsova, "there is no tea!"
Good thing I brought Chinese, cooked.
And the kettle.
But just so you know, we have worse food on the courts.
There's a choice here, despite the intolerable monotony.
I personally chose cod steamed and fries in tomato sauce.
A sign with the name of the food in three languages - English, French, and Portuguese - and the nutritional value and presence of allergens is placed next to each dish.
Well, I'll admit, it was good.
I don't even know why there's a line at the local McDonald's.
The full, relaxed, warm athletes are waiting outside the restaurant for our best friends, the representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're a very clever trick, a quiz that gives the winner a T-shirt.
Provocative, you might say!
To get a gift, you have to answer at least eight of the ten questions correctly.
I have questions in Russian! - attacked me a girl from WADA.
But I hit the wrong guy.
I mean, I got into a patriotic rush, naturally.
The situation was exacerbated by the second question: "If I receive a notification of a doping check, do I have to go to the checkpoint immediately?"
I'm stuck with option C: "No, I have one hour".
He lost his alertness, so to speak.
I forgot that you don't have to wait for WADA to give you a break.
Well, we should be there now.
Well, in the seventh round of the quiz, my situation became critical.
I figured that if I was having a hard time keeping a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and I am), I could use supplements to get "extra nutrients to boost my performance".
No, they won't!
In fact, the answer is worded in a way that is not categorically forbidden, but rather strongly discouraged in several sentences.
It's not fair on WADA!
"How are you, Russia?" the quiz host mockingly asks.
There's nowhere to go but Yefimov, Isinbayev and our whole bloodless team.
So I focused and, out of the last straw, I won the unlucky shirt.
You know what they say, ours!
In a victory mood, I went to the gym next door.
He's into counting exercise machines.
He's down by 250.
He was surprised to see that no Russian athletes were found in this pile of running tracks.
But maybe it's the right one.
Let the one who can't play practice!
And in the nearby clinic, there was a guy.
In line for the eye doctor.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
The clinic, however, like the whole village, has a condom machine.
It has the stirring message: "Celebrate with a condom!"
Now, just twist the iron, which resembles a doorknob, and the condom, made of natural Amazon latex, will fall out of the device.
I took one for a souvenir.
The athletes are getting 450 thousand .
Just for festive and leisure time in the Olympic Village there is a whole entertainment center.
There's a sign next to it just in case, reminding you that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, pool and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some weird video-like devices.
I'm interested in a friend in the uniform of the Ukrainian national team who actively uses a strange toy.
I could, of course, just say I don't want to talk to a man in a Russian uniform, that's all.
There's some weird coincidence in the eyes of the guys in the yellow and blue.
The most-played team, it turns out.
To walk around the village, looking around every corner, it takes at least three hours.
But if you walk instead of driving electric cars, you'll have a Canadian moose house at the entrance and a tent with a refreshing bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaner, and a barber shop, and a flower shop, and a convenience store, and a post office with unique stamps (only you can't wait in line for Chinese philatelists anyway), and a bank, and a finder's office, and a photo kiosk.
And late at night, exhausted, you will sit by an olive tree, with ribbons of colored ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who have left this world.
And you'll be accompanied by a machine that's spraying insect-killing fluid in a disorderly fashion, thinking of eternity.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village never stops for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world watched with bated breath as the Australians nearly punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that I was the first to hear that Inna Deriglazova won gold in the rapper at the XXXI Olympic Games.
I may even be the only Muscovite who saw it happen - apart from, of course, those who watched the Carioca games that night.
Only a true fan can understand that.
Imagine this: a dull Moscow night.
The neighbors downstairs, as usual, wake up around 1 a.m. and start yelling at each other, not maliciously, but loudly.
And threatening to move furniture.
The kitchen faucet is leaking, so there's no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
I don't understand anything about the TV schedule, so I just kept watching Match, Prime, and just in case, Russia, which is almost pointless.
Russia is the land of repetition, all sports there for some reason in the record.
They're broadcasting live.
Hope, of course, was on Match - the young man was screaming all night in the news first about the great Deriglazoff-Shanaev semifinal, then about the upcoming gold fight.
It would be logical to show it.
But instead, basketball is USA vs. Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this decision, by the way.
The Australians were tied, they won the first half.
Putting Americans in their place who are dazed by their own greatness.
We lost, but as they say now, the Olympic basketball tournament will never be the same.
That's all good, but there's a fight coming up with DiFrancisca, and nothing's changed on the screen.
I'm starting to look through the channels in a slight panic.
It feels like the second time in a row.
All right, let's go in the deep end, cable.
None of the themed "Matches" are fencing.
And I have a feeling the fight is about to begin.
I'm not comfortable with texting and tweeting from some sports websites.
The surfing convulsions are unexpected but brilliant.
The website of the First, it turns out, is live technical broadcast of all the competitions that are taking place at this moment in time.
I click on the fencing button, I get a gold medal.
Deriglasova is a great counterattacker, he's going for the points - and he's obviously starting to lose time.
The Italian girl's playing most of the time.
We're one point ahead, just over two seconds to go.
Di Francesca throws a punch at Deriglazow, she backs off, time runs out, Italian gives her shot.
The win!
A few seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports the fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
The crazy, the loyal, the involved.
The Religious Administration of Muslims of Tatarstan (DUM) refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the Duma plenum obliged its imams to preach on Fridays only in Tatar to force young Tatars to "learn their native language".
The administration says it "in no way infringes" on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that up to 60% of the congregation, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves, do not understand Tatar.
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience".
Yesterday, the plenum of the State Duma of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
As stated by the mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigulin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars "to learn their native language".
"For those who say it's 'difficult,' we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free in every large mosque", Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques the sermon "should be in Tatar language".
He recalled that the Duma of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam who does not speak Tatar well enough "can prepare himself well".
The DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, in the districts, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques used to be predominantly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, the Zakaban and "Eniler".
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the management sets the task that all students should know both the national languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no talk of any discrimination against non-Muslims", Mr. Muhammadshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not an obligatory, main part of the prayer".
The prayers will still be in Arabic, while the lectures and lessons will be in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Mohammetshin told "Ъ" that there was no serious threat of the suppression of the Tatar language from the mosques.
Other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in the sermons in the republic.
The decision of the Duma was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC).
The head of the Executive Committee of the World Trade Center Rinat Zakirov told "Ъ": "Mosques are an important part of our national life".
It would be sad if the Tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that preaching in Tatar was "the wish of the imams themselves", but the WCC executive committee "considers it correct".
The imams interviewed by "Ъ" who preached in Russian are ready to comply with the DUM's decision, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don't understand the language.
They'll be sad, of course.
"We will have to rebuild", says the imam of the Burnaev mosque Farhat Mawletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is even closer to many Tatars, since "Russian is the first language in schools, kindergartens, and on the radio everywhere".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue the lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We put our trust in God.
Allah will show us a way out of this situation", he concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
They are both Uzbeks, and Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
We have a lot of foreign students, Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we switched to Russian four years ago", says the imam.
He believes that the sermons in Tatar will "reach a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience".
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
It's just the result of the sermon will be different.
But time will tell.
"For me, for example, it will be easier because Tatar is my mother tongue", concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.
The former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is on trial
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office has approved an indictment in the criminal case investigated by the SCR State Security Service on the theft of budget funds allocated for the needs of the Russian Federal Criminal Investigation Service.
The former head of the prison department Alexander Raymer and his deputy will appear before the court, who caused the FISA a loss of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The Prosecutor's Office of the capital sent to the Zamoskvorechye district court a criminal case against the former director of the Federal Criminal Investigation Service of Russia Alexander Raymer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unit of Information and Communications of the Federal Penal Service (FGUP CITOS) Viktor Opreinenov.
Depending on their role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the Moscow State Criminal Investigation Department under part 3 of article 285 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code (abuse of official authority, which has led to serious consequences), part 4 of article 159 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code (fraud committed using their service position, in the composition of an organized group, in a particularly large size).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under part 1 of Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CCR, in 2010-2012, these individuals fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated by the Federal Criminal Investigation Service to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal the budget money, the group's members developed a scheme according to which the FGUP CITOS, which had signed relevant state contracts, produced technical control and surveillance tools, including "electronic bracelets", and sold them at prices several times higher.
Despite the fact that the FGUP CITO did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production capacities, allowing to create a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", between it and the Federal Statistical Service of Russia were concluded five state contracts for a total of more than 3,3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were found on the accounts of the Samara branch of the FSUP, of which 1,2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash money was received by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of his accomplices, against whom the criminal case is being handled separately.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the fraud, was found to have a cartridge from an unknown source, which allowed him to be charged with an additional crime.
According to the case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the Federal Criminal Investigation Service filed a claim against the accused for compensation of material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Football player Hakan Shukhur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of former footballer and then parliament member Hakan Shukkur and searched two of his family's homes.
Turkish football star of the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Shukkur is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with a coup attempt last month.
The forward, who retired from the sport in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group".
The movement is a society linked to the prominent Turkish religious figure and opposition figure Fethullah Gülen.
President Erdogan considers him the mastermind behind the coup attempt on July 15.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Shukhur today, and police have already searched two homes belonging to the former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gülen's organization included his father as well as Hakan Shukhur.
However, neither the former footballer nor his family was there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
During his career as a footballer, Hakan Shukür defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career in Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
He never spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukkur is still the most prolific attacker in Turkey's national team: he has played 112 matches for the national team and scored 51 goals.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his parliamentary post due to the corruption investigation that had been launched against Erdogan's party and his inner circle.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were issued arrest warrants in Turkey on July 25.
They are accused of aiding a military coup and ties to US-based Islamist preacher Fethullah Gülen.
Given the severity of the charges, media workers face long prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas for domestic films only.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, which costs 2-3 times less than foreign films", he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are hard to compete with big Hollywood films for viewership.
We have more than 100 films produced in our country every year, of which an average of 20-25 films reach the screen.
"Even they have a hard time competing with Transformers and Iron Man, which have huge budgets", said the filmmaker.
Recall that on July 1 in Crimea began work All-Russian youth educational forum "Tavrida".
Among the participants - teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian directions from all over Russia and a number of countries of the near and far abroad.

The new general contractor promises to have Zenit Arena in service by December 26th.
The new general contractor of the stadium under construction in St. Petersburg, which is to host matches of the Confederations Cup 2017 and the 2018 World Cup, MetroStructure promises to commission the arena by December 26, reports "RIA Novosti" with reference to the head of the Federation Council's temporary commission for preparation for the 2018 World Cup Vadim Tulypanov.

He said he'd have the stadium completed by December 26th.
This is a serious St. Petersburg company, they never break deadlines.
Vitaly Mutko and I were pleased with what we saw and heard", the source said.
Earlier, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the venue for the upcoming large-scale competition.
Mr. Tulypanov also noted that the commission of the Federation Council will continue to monitor the progress of the construction of the stadium and will regularly visit the construction.
The contract with the "Transstroy Corporation", "Transstroy-SPb" and "Transstroy" Engineering Corporation was terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to compete for the stadium.

In Miass (Chelyabinsk region) the lawyer of former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakov Konstantin Akulich was detained.
As reported by "Ъ-Южный Урал" another lawyer of the accused - Sergey Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulich was called today to the investigation department of the SCR Miass to present charges in the case of a year ago about beatings.
At the time, Konstantin Akulich was traveling to the scene of the accident as an attorney to help one of the victims.
"It was initially raised against unidentified persons, but now that he has started to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turns out that it was Akulich", says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulich became the former deputy governor's lawyer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the lawyer was summoned to the Miass SC, the defense was notified that on Monday the deadline for the examination of the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakov is accused expires.
We remind you that two criminal cases have been opened against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first case (fraud) he is accused of promising to assist in the appointment of the head of the administration of Ozersk, Yevgeny Tarasov, to the post of mayor of Magnitogorsk.
The second criminal case concerns a bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the director of the "Piton" industrial complex Igor Kalugin in the form of illegal gratuitous rendering of services of a property nature in the amount of at least 1,3 million rubles.
Read more about Mr. Sandakov's case in the Kommersant article "Former Vice Governor Demands Unification of His Affairs".
The Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK has taken up the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabakh copper smelting plant.
The Karabakh copper smelter was founded by an English joint stock company headed by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided the life of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, a decision was made to resume the work of the Karabakh copper smelter.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at "Karabashmedi" began to change in 2004, after the enterprise came under the management of the Russian copper company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited the "Karabashmedy" in the first days of July.
The head of the South Urals called the changes that have occurred with the enterprise since "Karabashmed" has moved to the group of RMK.
The main event in the modernization of "Karabashmedi" in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian Copper Company, Vsevolod Levin, the investment in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of the "Karabashmed" ZAO is the reconstruction of the converter partition.
The three converters, the fume box, the gas line are scheduled to be replaced by the end of 2017.
The project cost is 2.5 billion rubles .
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes paid to the budget of Karabash will increase.
For the entire period of the Tomin GOK project - from the beginning of construction to the commissioning of the second phase - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the GOC is put into operation , the tax revenue to all levels of the budget may reach 80.9 billion rubles .
For the year of production in the Varna district , 346,3 million rubles were transferred to the budgets of different levels .
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the enterprise is successful, the more the amount of the allowances can be", added Valery Ulanovsky.
The RMK clarified that in 2015 tax deductions from the Miheevsk GOK approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMK enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
The enterprises of the RMK help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve the environment.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabakh was the capital renovation, and in fact - almost complete reconstruction of the N9 kindergarten for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of disrepair.
Also on the territory of the "RMK Arena" will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
"RMK Arena" will allow to hold spectacular professional sports events of international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical education and sports accessible to the residents of Chelyabinsk, first of all, to children.

The Sandholm refugee center in Denmark has been suspected of having teenagers in prostitution.
This was reported by The Local on Thursday, August 11.
He said that some teenagers told the staff that "someone in Copenhagen is running a prostitution operation".
The paper notes that the workers' doubts arose after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan reported similar stories in Malmö.
In 2015, the European Union was hit by a refugee crisis caused by an influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has placed more than 20,000 of them on its territory.

A man found a shellfish among the others caught in his underwater trap, ABC News reports.
The American plans to transfer it to the local aquarium.
The lobster weighs about a kilo.

The five-meter-high animal weighs about a ton.
The Black Sea Fleet conducted a drill for anti-submarine diversion defenses in the Black Sea.
This was reported by the representative of the press service of the Ministry of Defense for the Navy Igor Dygalo.
The training was conducted as part of the first phase of the special types of training for the Navy.
"The military personnel of the anti-submarine divisions have worked out the anti-submarine defense of the base of the fleet forces on the coast and adjacent sea waters of the Black Sea", - said Dygal.
The exercises involved about 400 military personnel, more than 10 units of military equipment, including Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters, anti-version boats "Grachonok" and patrol fast boats "Raptor".
During the maneuvers, the force of the branding ships using hydro-acoustic means detected the conditional diversion groups and repelled the attack of "submarine diversionists" from the sea to the base of the forces of the CHF.
A Ka-27 helicopter landed a assault group, which blocked and destroyed the enemy's diversionaries.
After that, the Black Sea Fleet trawlers went out to sea to search for mines.
Dygaló stated that "the Black Sea Fleet exercises are being conducted in accordance with the plan for the preparation and conduct of the forthcoming command-and-staff exercise "Caucasus-2016" and the Navy training plan".

A court in Moscow arrested a father for killing his adopted daughter:
The Lake City Court of the Moscow region has authorized the arrest of Roman Chernikov, who confessed to killing his six-year-old adopted daughter.
This was reported on Thursday, August 11, by Nina Zhilkina, the press secretary of the court, according to the Moscow city news agency.
"The court granted the request of the investigating authorities to choose a measure of restraint in the form of imprisonment for two months against Chernikov", she said.
Chernikov will be in custody until October 9.
On August 11, the Moscow Region Criminal Investigation Department reported that the adoptive parents and grandmother of the six-year-old girl had confessed to her murder.
In particular, Roman Chernikov reported that he had murdered a child on one of the days of April 2016 from personal hostile relations, while at home in a state of alcohol intoxication.
Then, in order to hide the child's body, he burned it and scattered the remains with his wife in a large square.
On the evening of August 9, the adoptive parents reported that in April 2016, a six-year-old child drowned in the bath.
For a long time they managed to hide the disappearance of the girl from everyone, but in August, when they learned that soon the guardianship authorities would come to their home, they decided to tell everyone that the child was missing.
The parents claimed that on August 6, their adopted daughter left the area of the house where they lived with their family and disappeared.
Pope Francis shared a meal with Syrian refugees in the Vatican.
The Holy See's press secretary, Greg Burke, said Thursday that the Vatican's press secretary, Greg Burke, was not present at the meeting.
The migrants came at the invitation of the pontiff from the Greek island of Lesbos.
The luncheon was held at the Vatican's St. Martha's House, where Francis's private apartments are located.
The two groups of Syrian refugees were present at the meal, which the pontiff visited in Greece on April 16.
On the way back to the Vatican, he took 12 migrants, including six children, on board his plane.
In June, a second group of Syrians arrived.
The Holy See took care of them.
"Dad brought toys and gifts to the children, they gave him their drawings in return, and the children and adults were able to talk to the pope today about their first days in Italy", Burke said.
During his April visit, the Pope called the migration crisis that erupted in Europe in 2015 "the greatest disaster since World War II".
Greece is one of the countries that brings the most migrants to Europe.
According to Greek authorities, in 2015, a total of 800,000 people have moved from Turkey to Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.
Lesvos has become a major transit point for refugees on their way to the EU.

The pensioner turned the beach house into a "budget beach tower".
Users laughed at photos of an elderly man setting up a beach trampoline and turning it into a jumping-in-water trampoline.
The photo was posted on several entertainment portals, as well as in the "My Taganrog" group on the social network "Vkontakte", which led many to believe that the photo was taken on the coast of the Azov Sea.
The comments called the innovation a "budget tower" and a "mobile trampoline".
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "sneakiness", and some pointed out that the man was at serious risk of injury when jumping from his tower because he had installed it at insufficient depth.
However, one commentator on Pikabu noted that the depth of the sea cannot be judged by the picture.
"Firstly, we don't know how deep it is, the beach can be heaped with a sharp drop of one meter right behind the stairs, and secondly, even if it is one meter deep, with the right skill you can jump from a couple of meters", wrote the user under the alias C0JIbAMDJZ.
The Italian newspaper Roma Today reports that a man with a strapless dress was spotted on a beach near Rome.

The authorities of the French city of Cannes have banned people from visiting beaches in burkinis, a special bathing suit for women that completely covers the body from head to ankle.
This was reported on Friday, August 12, by ABC News.
Cannes mayor David Lisnard explained that such clothing "does not conform to the rules of decency, the principles of secularism, and the standards of hygiene and safety".
He also said that clothing that highlights religious affiliation can cause disorder.
A fine of 38 euros (about $42) has been imposed for wearing a burkini.
The ban comes in the wake of the July 15 attacks in Nice and the July 26 attacks on the church in the northern city of Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvre.
After the law was introduced, several Muslim women took the law to court, claiming that the restrictions violated their right to freedom of religion.
The city court of Благовещенск (Amur region) sentenced the former head of the city Alexander Migul to nine years in a general regime colony.
This was reported on Friday, August 12, on the court website.
Miguel was found guilty of committing crimes under articles 286 ("Exceeding powers"), 285.1 ("Non-purposeful spending of budgetary funds") and 285 ("Abuse of official powers") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that the official in December 2008 gave his acquaintance a land plot in the village of Muhinka with violation of the procedure established by the land legislation.
In 2006, he illegally issued a decision to acquire the city's ownership of the Chigiri River bridge at an exorbitant price without competitive procedures and a municipal contract, Interfax reports.
In addition, in the period from 2007 to 2010, Migula changed the terms of payments under the purchase and sale contract of the land lease agreement, which was provided for the construction of housing, in the interests of the commercial organization under his control, and also exempted the company from rental fees.
As a result, the budget of the region received less than 5 million rubles, and the city treasury about 21 million rubles.
On August 4, it became known that the former mayor, who was in custody on suspicion of corruption and was a candidate for the deputy mandate, did not submit the ballot papers for the State Duma elections in time and was removed from the election race.
Migul was detained in May 2015 in the territory of the Lipetsk region and placed in a detention center.
Before that, he was on the international wanted list since 2011.
Alexander Migula was mayor of Благовещенск from November 2004 to April 2010.

The music is a video of the construction of the Crimean bridge.
The song was written and performed by Konstantin Homenko - a designer from the "Institute of Giprostructuremost - Saint Petersburg", who developed the project of the building.
He's not a professional musician.
Thailand's interior ministry has blamed local saboteurs for the blasts at the resort.
The bombings at Thailand's resorts are "local acts of sabotage" and have nothing to do with international terrorism.
This was reported by the Thai police, Reuters reports.
According to the security guards, they have not yet been able to determine if the explosions are connected.
The main story is that the organizers were trying to disrupt the tourist season.
It's possible that Muslim separatists from the south of the country are behind the bombings.
Law enforcement has already arrested several people.
At this time, we know of four dead and dozens of wounded.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha ordered extra security measures to prevent further explosions and to rule out possible casualties.
A series of explosions occurred in Thailand's tourist resorts on Friday, August 12.
The devices worked at police stations on Phuket Island, in Surat Thani (the capital of the province of the same name, on the territory of which the island of Samui is located) and Hua Hin.
Another explosive device was defused by the bombers.
The day before, on August 11, two explosions occurred in the resort city of Huaxin.
The bombs were in potted plants and were triggered by a cell phone call.
Among the victims are 10 foreign tourists, no Russians among them.

Owners of messengers and postal services must identify users and remove banned information - such is the brief content of a bill developed by the Media Communication Union (MKS), which unites the largest Russian telecom operators (Vedomosti has one).
Employees of three member companies confirmed that such a project is being discussed.
It should be presented to a working group led by first vice-premier Igor Shuvalov in early autumn, said a Vedomosti interviewee at the ISS.
It's about the amendments to the Communications and Media Act.
The rules provide that any "organizer of the dissemination of information on the Internet that provides the possibility of exchanging electronic messages" must identify users on the basis of information contained in the databases of telecommunications operators, having previously concluded contracts with them.
It also "immediately blocks messages or publications that contain information that is distributed in violation of Russian legislation".
Otherwise, operators have the right to restrict access to the service by the decision of the State Agency for Monitoring and Evaluation.
Astronomers have discovered a mysterious space object beyond Neptune.
Astronomers have discovered a mysterious space object beyond Neptune.
The object is very faint, measuring about 125 miles [200 km] in diameter, reports New Scientist.
According to the researchers, the object is moving in an orbit completely unusual for the solar system.
It's almost perpendicular to the other planets.
The mysterious find has been given the name Niku, which translates from Chinese to "rebellious", "unruly".
WSJ: The US is considering sanctions against Russia over the hack of the Democrats' servers.
U.S. officials are considering new sanctions against Russia in response to the hack of the Democratic Party's servers, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.
The administration of US President Barack Obama will reportedly have to officially blame Russia or Russian-backed hackers for the attack on the servers in order to impose sanctions.
Sources say the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are pretty sure Russia was involved in the cyber attack.
The WSJ notes that the US generally prefers not to name the perpetrators of the hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 data breach of Sony Entertainment Pictures, which was officially blamed on North Korea.
But last year, Obama issued an executive order to simplify sanctions against those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally aimed at China, but it can be used against other countries.
The sanctions decision process could be a long one, the paper said.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers acted with Russian backing, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding whether to release the information.
They will have to determine if the incident is so serious that it could exacerbate the tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of sanctions against the state whose hackers hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the Democratic National Committee.
Media reports suggested that hackers working with Russian authorities may have been involved in the hack.
The Kremlin called such reports absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason for this was the disruption of competition in the mobile application market.
An antitrust proceeding was initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google gave smartphone manufacturers access to Android components on terms that prohibited pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
The FAS found support for these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install other applications along with the Google Play store.
Following the investigation, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said FAS Deputy Director Alexey Docenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the order coming into force.
The FAS concluded that the law on competition protection must be observed by all companies, including transnational corporations.
Google, in turn, intends to study the decision first and then decide on further action: to enforce it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violation of the competition law back in September last year and ordered it to correct the contracts by December 18.
But Google wouldn't let me do that.
Since then, the company and the agency have been in litigation.
The FAS said that despite the fine, they are discussing a settlement with Google.
This measure will get us nowhere.
This is the opinion of the leading analyst of the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect users or the corporation's competitiveness.
The Volzhanin rented an apartment, and then stole 84 thousand rubles from it.
The 30-year-old robber managed to sell the stolen appliances.

Snapchat's "anime" effect criticized as a caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that the filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it is racially insensitive.
With the Lens tool, Snapchat enables its roughly 150 million users a day to alter reality and play with individuality in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to fit into a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are rough, curved-line tools that create over 30 million self-corrected selfies a day.
Any mistakes are quickly made public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark skin or promoting whitened faces as a beauty ideal.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of Asians  "yellow".
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions pointed to a bigger problem for the company, which is diversity.
The posts went viral on Wednesday, followed by outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it was taking the feature down.
The company commented that the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to experts who know about racism, the lens reminded them of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said the lens was "insulting and at least embarrassing".
She added that "it's hard to argue with comparing a very crude Asian cartoon and filter effects side by side.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowface, but highly degradingly yellowface.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's crossing these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood to the gadgets we all carry around.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- may mean that they're more likely to be understood.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder to go unnoticed than it used to be".
On Thursday, Ju, a product manager and engineer who works at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a Medium article and a phone interview, she said she believes that racial contrasts are the reason for the lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring.
Ju criticized the company's predominantly white, all-male management and ended her article with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, herself a Chinese-American, wrote, "Either they didn't have enough non-white people in their staff to make these decisions, or they have non-white people working, but they don't have positions where they can speak up safely and openly".
Other reviewers share her view, expressing displeasure that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its staff on Thursday, but a source said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and actively engage internal resources.
For her part, Ju said she would keep her Snapchat account private, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say no".
Military officials misrepresented intelligence about ISIS, says congressional committee
Officials at the U.S. Central Command have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the facts on the ground, a congressional committee said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by a task force established by the Republican chairs of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts who claimed that the leaders had rigged their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents approved by the Central Command generally provided a more optimistic picture of U.S. counterterrorism than the actual data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies", the news release said.
"What happened at the CENTCOM is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with a false analysis, our military suffers", said House Representative Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The leadership problems at CENTCOM are reaching the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the continuing gaps in the 2014 and 2015 narrative and analysis of U.S. training efforts for the Iraqi military provided by Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration's leadership ordered the reports to be falsified, it does claim that analysts felt that the C.C.C. leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from Central Command to Congress were significantly more optimistic than the actual events", the report said.
For example, a C.C.O. official has publicly stated that a major military attack to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is for sure", said House Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest level of the U.S. Central Command intelligence community falsified intelligence documents to play down the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State was being falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report released Thursday will be followed by more details.
An additional, unfinished investigation into the C.T.O. intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party on the House Intelligence Committee released their own data on Thursday, which agrees with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, the CENTCOM created an overly closed procedure for intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces", said House Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic primary spokesman on the committee.
This procedure, Schiff said, "has delayed the release of intelligence documents", damaged analysts' morale, and "does not adequately reflect the divergent views".
But Schiff and the Democrats say they found no evidence that the White House tried to force C.I.A. analysts to fit their conclusions into "a given or political interpretation".
The preliminary findings of the congressional investigation were released Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general that was launched after complaints from C.I.A. analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continues.
But he said "experts sometimes disagree on how to interpret complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security issues".
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the bombing of Iraq and Syria by the Americans is achieving its goal (as more and more Defense Ministry officials are now claiming).
But last year's statements raised questions about whether President Obama can be trusted to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other hotspots.
The criticism of the Islamic State intelligence reiterates a controversy that began more than a decade ago when CIA analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper claiming that the administration of President George W. Bush, out of a protest by many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protests over intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said, Hooker's team concluded that despite public claims to the contrary, airstrikes on Islamic State-owned refineries did not significantly deteriorate the terrorist group's financial position because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not spread beyond Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after testimony in the Senate that many lawmakers considered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins its fourth straight women's field hockey title, bringing it closer to a decisive match with Britain.
Having scored three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Bham opened the scoring Thursday with her first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, says she's not sure she'd ever do something like that.
"I can't help it", she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals.
Here's what she knows: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they're vying for first place in their group with Britain, who remain unbeaten after losing 2-0 to Japan on Thursday.
The teams of Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams are in the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will finish first in their group of six teams and who will finish second.
The winner will avoid a strong team from the Netherlands, the leaders of the other group, by waiting a little while before the quarter-finals begin.
Saturday's game, however, shows the Americans have made a splash here with their surprise series, four years after finishing last out of 12 teams at the London Games.
Bame was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first picked up a hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at age 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the final squad.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammates were not getting along.
The following year, Coeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in fitness", said Bam.
We didn't have the productivity we have now in London.
We've completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a short-range shot from an uncomfortable arm.
India came into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bame took the initiative.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiralled into the middle and sent the ball into the goal, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The win was the first in the tournament for USA goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of her first three wins.
She's in shock.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now", Parnham said, "but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympics , the jumps on the batut .
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio seem unchanging and inevitable, a mad mix of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic flame itself is that burning torch that's passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors in line at a coffee shop and not hear about Simone Biles, Kathy Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clow.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian, a handsome man with pits on his cheeks, could well be among the celebrities shown on prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencing player.
But 28-year-old Dooley, from Lake Forest, California, is vying for the Olympic gold in the pole vault.
The Olympic flame doesn't shine the same light on all events.
Farther from the center, partly in the shade, are those sports that are not universally recognized: shooting from a pneumatic pistol, shooting from a bow, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long live his reign.
But if I may be so bold as to speak in defense of my personal addiction, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has received so little recognition in the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that it was an Olympic sport at all.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won a medal in the pole vault, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share the men's awards, and the Chinese and Canadians the women's.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumping has the charm of an outsider, in part because to the uneducated ear, it's more associated with a circus college than the Olympics.
I must admit that I am not an expert, but a grounded enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential  it's the cartoonish flash of endless jumping  but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that they basically combine.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", which means "a trampoline for jumping into water".
Contestants jump almost 30 feet into the air on a giant trampoline and perform a series of acrobatic tricks (twists, bends, and salto) before finally landing on their feet.
They are rated by performance, difficulty and "flight time", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is  forward.
The medal contenders must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They are not only aiming for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in full view of the cameras, for another teasing frontier: a world or Olympic record.
This persistence is noble, admirable, even fanatical, and it is enough to make even the spectator cry.
But I think it's a little bit of a drag watching the Games.
He's a breath of fresh air for the jumps.
The direction of the batutist is upwards.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.
And they're not without competition or challenges, of course, but throughout the program there's no crazy rush to the finish, no long jump, just the strange, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest thing to Zen in the Olympics.
The women's qualifying competition and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1pm Eastern European time; the men's - on Saturday, also at 1pm.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of a daytime program starting at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected that can easily be missed in the common garbage.
And if the only way to raise awareness is to subject male athletes to the coveted gaze and objectification that, according to the Wall Street Journal, male gymnasts in the United States recently suggested, Dooley is just waiting for his new crowd of admirers.
Generation Protest in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the US
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a firm ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to more and more of its territory.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights activists say the government's response has been brutal.
Witnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed protesters.
Video footage from the protest sites, allegedly taken late last year or early this year, shows security officers beating young people with sticks as they were put against a wall.
A senior United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even harder", said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the international crisis research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives this kind of support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly  there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe, and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy  human rights organizations constantly mention government repression - opposition within the state was suppressed by effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven into distant deserts.
But that could change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left with no choice but to protest, there will be an uprising", said Seyum Teshomé, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the youths are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are numerous, from land use to the government coalition's seizure of power.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea, where fighting over the disputed, uncertain border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less wiped out in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the unrest to rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been simmering in the depths of the soul for years, flare up now.
The first one seems to be completely harmless: smartphones.
It's only in the last couple of years that more Ethiopians have been able to use social media as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and internet access has improved.
Even when the government closes Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find a way to communicate through proxy servers that hide their location.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized their protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amharas from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia have flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that's changing, too.
"We will act together under one banner",  said Mulatu Gembechu, the Oromo leader.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo districts.
Many Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of concern is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was especially adept at recognizing the first sign of discontent and using scouts to gather intelligence and neutralize adversaries.
"The current regime lacks common sense", said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Haile Mariam Desalegn, has emerged from nowhere and taken Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemarim was a southerner.
Analysts say he's not trusted by the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said appeared to be an election that the government rigged and then rigged.
Many protesters were killed in the repressions that followed, although in smaller numbers than in recent months, and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia's leaders for the far-sighted infrastructure development, such as the new intercity train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But this obviously did not stop the growing domestic discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerously ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a town in Amhara, attacked Tigray-owned businesses, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming pervasive.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies at a disadvantage.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently announced it was shutting down the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose its power in an already unstable region.
"And this tightened rope will be difficult to pass", said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle the latest conflict that engulfed his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to speak intelligently to the American people.
It also put his deputies, who had tried to protect him during a period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
After making that assumption at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump insisted strongly on his claim on Thursday, reiterating in an interview that he really meant that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Trump said he was just being a jerk.
This post was the direct opposite of a statement made just a day earlier, when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his tone by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate missed the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a downgrade in ratings.
Trump and Clinton gave competing economic speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic.
Again, he took to Twitter to warn that Clinton's plans would lead to higher taxes, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism for practically suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's email, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course I'm kidding".
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is acceptable in political speech and take back what he said when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing out messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they perform, and then explaining them one way or another, depending on the reaction", said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he says and knows that it's vague enough to be interpreted differently.
Instead of softening his words to the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days as his ratings continue to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking released Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton by a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and going even in Florida.
While Trump generally tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump became the focus of increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, his jokes put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they had to publicly support him, however provocative his statements might be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who is one of Trump's most prominent deputies, made a serious effort to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment", Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a tiny little organization, he called it a non-threat, totally unfair, and that's why it happened, because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most average Republicans say the Obama administration, which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to flourish because it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's rally in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for twisting his every word and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor wretches" television pundits who tried to figure it out, and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump's excuses as further proof that he is unfit to be president.
A once-displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint .
The Verbe Coffee Shop was a shabby cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of her window on Bedford Avenue.
The Sherry Soup store, which replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a city in the making.
Artist Molly Crabble tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and The Verve is now a soap shop".
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is renewing itself.
The revived Verb Coffee House opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and credit cards, but it's still got some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
Plus, the coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop who is the owner and general manager at the new location.
He started working at the Verbe in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered to sponsor him at a new location, he said he would gladly do so.
Rodriguez, now 36, left much of his legacy intact.
The Verbe works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has old Verbe chandeliers.
But Rodriguez said he'd like to experiment, too.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, and capers or fried onion toppings.
There are dishes made from brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now they make freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many former customers were also overwhelmed by prices from Williamsburg", he said.
On one of the recent Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, was a former Williamsburg resident and a frequent visitor to the Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still stopped by.
After the Verve closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that coffee and the atmosphere were what impressed me about The Verve", she said.
She's drinking coffee again, although that day she ordered iced tea instead of regular iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a regular at The Verve since 2003.
He would come in before work and order the same thing.
"At fifteen minutes eight o'clock every day, like clockwork, I came, and for me they made my bagel with butter and all the stuffing", he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and added new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but one day he'll make a change with bacon, eggs or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he didn't mind the soap store taking over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Cherry offered to make a special soap for Verbe using cold brew coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we might accept their offer", Rodriguez said.
Greenpoint's Polish-born residents also love the coffee.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for it in the window so his new neighbors would feel welcome.
There are other benefits to moving.
A local juice store plans to bottle-drink and sell cold brew coffee.
There's a chance the coffee shop will be joined by a neighboring building.
For many customers, it's enough that the new Verbe will include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in its new location, Whitt said that when he went in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was back home.
"I've wanted to smell that for a long time", he admitted.
Depressing food for depression at the Meat Table.
In March 1933, shortly after taking office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt enjoyed Fifth Avenue fashionable dishes like foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, blackcurrant pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who were suffering", said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are experts in food history.
Coa's latest book, Ragu in Chinese, was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of her life in a rental apartment on the Lower East Side through food in her book House 97 on the Fruit Garden.
Their new collaborative work, "The Dinner Table", to be published Tuesday by Harper's, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
In a show of culinary solidarity of their own, they met the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, casual diner in the Flatiron District that has been in business since 1929, the year of the stock market crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and a sandwich with olive slices, and Cough, 57, got a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered a meat roast, the couple thought it was a good starting point for a discussion about food during the Depression.
"Roulette was in high demand", said Siegelman.
There was a peanut butter, a liver butter, a bean butter.
They were made from the basic ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine that you have eaten all the peanuts you need for dinner.
Kow frowned.
"He must have been lying in a stone stomach", he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was the Swedish table.
Groups of women prepared for the male farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "The Feast of Meat" describes how the country coped with what suddenly ceased to be a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, challenging topic for Americans", said Coe, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budgetary diet was no less challenging: Mysterious dishes like rolls and baked goods became staples; baking is "a great way to recycle the food", observed Siegelman, "because cooks can hide unpalatable ingredients under a thick layer of sauce".
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, once a staple of American food for many years, has become a cheaply distributed luxury.
People tried strange blends because the energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that included recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of the era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining table has not been successful", said Coe.
Sigelman added: "It was very strange".
Peanut butter is not good for roasted onions.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
Never before, and never since, have home economists -- including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Housing Bureau from 1923 to 1943 -- managed the nation's food habits.
In recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget makers", to take on the challenge and turn the nonsense of scrubbed spaghetti and carrots into delicious dishes.
The Feast of the Feast is a feast of curious historical facts.
The government's response to starving citizens is particularly hot, as is President Herbert Hoover's "let them eat the pie" stance.
Publicly boasting of his simple Iowa farm life as a child, he fed off the refined millionaire he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce", Coe said.
He was practically eating in the gilded dining room in a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
The book says that Eleanor Roosevelt hired an housekeeper who had no interest in taste, and this resulted in the White House "consuming not only the most dismal food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared".
Many of the great Depression cuisines were forgotten once the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and how science has been used in cooking.
The couple said that during the writing of the book they had a better understanding of Zieglerman's mother's eating habits  that she could not throw food away, for example.
"She was seriously worried about the neglect of food", said Coe.
Siegelman recalls, "She was seriously poisoning people".
There was one nasty incident with the profiles.
When the plates at Eisenberg's ran out, she and Coe got a dessert they made at home: the blueberry dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called black plum mousse", said Siegelman, adding that it was a common practice to give modest recipes flashy names.
There was no whipped cream, just black plum, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was good.
Coe asked for two more.
In the voice of a confident budget writer, he said to his wife: "A few chopped walnuts would do".
The arrest of the defendants in the case of the mass fight in the Khovan cemetery has been extended until November 14
Presna court has allowed the defendants in the case of the mass fight at the Khovansk cemetery to remain in custody until November 14, satisfying the request of the investigation.
The case involves 14 people.
Recall that on May 14, a mass fight took place at the Khovan cemetery between several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus, in which three people were killed.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov, were charged with organizing the murder.
The second indexation of pensions in 2016 could be decided in the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Byan region.
We have specific parameters for how much pension should be raised to bring the inflation that exists in the country to a level.
All the calculations are done.
Now economists are summing up the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks", - quotes Holodets "Interfax".
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Center Alexei Kudrin to increase the retirement age by half a year each year, the vice-premier said that the Cabinet does not consider this topic.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan advanced to the finals of the competition in small caliber rifle shooting.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan have made it to the finals of the light-caliber rifle shooting competition at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
As TASS reports, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan was second - 628.9 was.
All in all, eight of the best athletes made it to the finals.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition figure Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt", Gulen was quoted as saying by the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition figure also said that "if any part of the accusations is confirmed, I will return to Turkey".
However, Gülen has denied any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
An Istanbul court has previously detained opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen in absentia.
A military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of July 15 to 16.
Gilead will reimburse for legal fees during the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck .
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover attorney's fees it incurred in a patent action against the hepatitis C drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc., a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was cleared of $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical conduct.
In her appeal Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to recover costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for the next generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case was in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other over their rights to the lab work behind sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
The US-backed military says it has taken full control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
US-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city left.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-allied Manbij military council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are undertaking clean-up operations", he told Reuters.
Clinton made $ 10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate .
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former Secretary of State reported an income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her time in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, and his wife, Anna Holt, have released their 10-year tax returns.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency", Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind bogus excuses and breaking his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited a tax audit as the reason he refused to release his tax returns.
"Your move", Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic nominee's declaration.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the inspections were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his refusal raised questions about his wealth, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed onto the issue and on Friday posted a video online highlighting prominent Republicans who were trying to persuade Trump to release his tax returns.
She raised the issue Thursday during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades: release his tax returns", she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business reporter on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying that may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have been a topic of debate in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would guarantee that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he too was under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was "afraid" not of the tax agency, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign released tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was from salaries.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons claimed $109,000 in dividends and capital gains.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks help protect Tanzanian elephants
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unconventional method to prevent elephants from wandering into populated areas by throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
It worked, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the U.S. Environmental Protection Committee, took it on, training volunteers in rural areas of northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent, four-step approach to protect their homes and crops without harming the animals.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we invented the toolkit... we have seen a change in attitude within these communities, resulting in them being much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them", Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps are to light a torch in front of an elephant that has crossed the line and to signal with the horn.
If they can't scare it away, they throw what's called a "chilli cloud".
The chili powder is mixed with soil, put with the cotton ball into the condom, and the end is twisted, leaving only the fuse outside.
When a condom is lit, it explodes with a thunderous roar, spraying fine dust of chili powder into the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn the elephant over.
The ultimate measure is a launcher that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Turkey has yet to return 32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year.
This was stated by the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 staff diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of these, 32 people have not returned without objective reasons and explanations", the head of the Turkish foreign ministry said.
In July, there was a coup attempt in Turkey.
The authorities of the country officially announced that the coup had failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military ranks of the highest and middle ranks.
The coup attempt killed, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people.
Jewish filmmaker sharply criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code at Arab "request"  RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin sparked a media scandal after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli phone number, with employees citing "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lantzman, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his displeasure with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lantzman tried to locate Israel in a phone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the countries where you can call directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
It's from Lantzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the ability to dial Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the question at the hotel's administration counter.
The answer he received there, Lantzman said, "shocked him".
The hotel clerk said the move was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain".
The reason for this move caused the director even more anger.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israeli code be removed", said , according to Lantzman, a hotel clerk.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a terrible shame", reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain is even more shameful.
No need to explain here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions", the official said.
The case caused a huge stir on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply "went along with" the supposed demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on us",  said another post, which said the hotel on the famous Kurfurstendamm is next to the synagogue.
The hotel has quickly dismissed any allegations, calling the incident a "miscarriage of justice" and "apologizing" to Lantzman, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the quick-list", Kempinski was quoted as saying by the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police tried to disperse the students, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern over the plans.
According to the proposal of the governor of the state of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing graffiti on the walls against acting President Michael Temer.
The latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, after the country's Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71 percent , RT Business reports
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Jagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a growing interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are re-establishing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran",  said Jagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons", the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran has for the first time entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken", he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he said.
The state continues to spin the nuts in the defense industry.
The reason for the dismissal was "systematic failure to fulfill" the instructions of the general director of the "Almaz-Antey" concern, "missing in work" and "loss of trust".
The head of the NGO for the next three years is appointed by Genndy Bendersky.
News of Neskorodov's dismissal only came out on Thursday evening and did not receive much media attention.
How can we explain such silence in the context of a massive rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the Russian leadership does not want any rumors or negative assumptions to spread in the public.
This is yet another confirmation that the defence industry has many problems and the state does not want to draw attention to them from society.
Neskorodov's removal is undoubtedly a major step in bringing order to the industry.
The NPO "Almaz" is the main enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of surface and sea-based anti-aircraft missile systems (ASM).
Currently, "Almaz" is working on the creation of the "Poliment-Redut" and "Morpheus" air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal, Dmitry Kornev, believes that Neskorodov's dismissal is due to the breakdown of deadlines for these projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, development of Morpheus began in 2007, and it was supposed to be put into service in 2013.
The Polymer Reducer is to become the primary air defense system on the Navy's newest ships.
From what I'm hearing, in the years of testing, there hasn't been a single successful test.
"The truth is, as far as I can tell, there is no clear fault of "Almaz", - said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay in commissioning may occur with the S-500 air defense system.
The experimental design work on the project is still not completed, but the first complexes should be delivered to the troops during 2016.
The Defense Ministry assures that "the work is being carried out in a planned manner and everything will be completed within the set time", although in 2014 the ministry acknowledged the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led "Almas" since 2011.
Kornev stated that the breakdown of deadlines for projects can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
He believes that in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about the internal processes in the defense industry and the plans of the enterprise management.
The industry has received long-term orders worth tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as we know, likes silence.
Generally, defense company directors leave their positions of their own free will, by agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension was public, though not a public one.
This suggests that the head of the "Almaz" was perhaps a stoic figure and resisted the "discharges" coming from above.
It seems that the state is no longer willing to tolerate this behavior.
By the hands of its shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to dispute the defense establishment and fail to fulfill their tasks.
At the same time, the Russian leadership is trying to punish the managers who broke in (the machinations at the Zvezda shipyard).
The President himself pays special attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of defense contractors, seeking to have a loyal board of directors that will follow orders from above.
This is far from ideal policy, but in the face of rampant corruption and lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state has no other tools.
The current defense situation is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation is encouraging the Kremlin to put the military in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The army's personnel composition has acquired a new quality with the arrival of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted the famous saying, "If you want peace, prepare for war".
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union's military might and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the Helsinki Pact, which consolidated Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
For all the flaws in the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The absence of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East are proof of this.
The triumph of the "victors" in the Cold War has turned into a reinforcement of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there seems to be no peaceful place in the "civilized world".
Despite the shared misery, the West refuses to talk to Russia as an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the navy and the army.
The strengthening of military might will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and to enter new frontiers of world politics.
Scot Callum Skinner races down the finish line, resulting in the British winning the cycling gold.
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to victory in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night, with the British trio defending their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the strongest role, which his Scottish pal Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the youngster proudly made history by running down the finish line to snatch the victory from the favourite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed a surprise victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a modest sixth at the March track cycling world championships in London, despite the fact that Hoy has since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of contestant specialist Jamie Staff.
They did so just at the time when Hindes appeared.
Hoey's departure also created a void that Kean Emady and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man the British coaches were drawn to, seeing the potential in the Scot who was now being realised.
Hinds, Kenny  champions with Hoy four years ago  and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold.
Hinds was right behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed up.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hinds drove on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoey watched from his seat as a BBC guest expert and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hinds as they stepped onto the pedestal.
"That's a flattering comparison", said 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow.
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After winning London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling onto the track after a poor start.
He later recanted the comment, and there was no way to appeal from UK competitors.
There was no question of that this time in the great victory.
Hinds said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags up in the stands".
We've all been working together as a team for the last three months.
We'd lost so many world-class races, it was just amazing to win the Olympics again.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress over the last five months, then the Velodrom is looking at five more successful days.
With Kenny's form, it's not out of the question to imagine him repeating Hoye's feat, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would see Kenny  who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoye, who was also born on 23 March (it seems to be a holy date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Moe Farah and Roger Bannister)  bring his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be just like Hoye.
Next time Kenny competes in the sprint, which starts today and runs for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely winning alone, honestly.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified as the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit four-man.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympics gold medal is 3:51.659.
The first round and final at 10:42 p.m. will be held today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the stewards yesterday, before the qualifying race, when officials demanded he take his weight.
In the women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milnavahi improved the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain has come to rely on a powerful cycling team to take over the mid-term Olympics and earn a bunch of medals.
After truly exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations eased in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There have been secondary dramas, not least the departure of technical director Shane Sutton in April over accusations of sexism and harassment, and the departures of big names like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But based on the first night's race at the track, it seems that Britain's now legendary glory of reaching the summits at the right time may just be about to repeat itself.
The future of Portland 's steel mill is in jeopardy because of the termination of the electricity contract .
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria  and the jobs of hundreds of workers  are at stake because the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant's owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
The move follows a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government not to renew subsidies to support the plant.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
As many as 2,000 jobs  directly and indirectly  could be at risk from any closure.
There may also be additional side effects, since the steel mill consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed its Point Henry steel mill, which led to the closure of the Englesey power plant last year.
Portland's Alcoa steel mill is losing money and is in danger of closing.
These actions were the result of several years of deliberations about the future of the plant, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later - due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expected the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contracts as well.
The controlling stake in the plant is owned by a short-term joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, while smaller shares are held by Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, meaning that physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not stop", she said.
According to AGL, the contracts in question are so-called 'hedged contracts' which were to come into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month cancellation period, so they actually expire in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring in their share of revenue in the 2017 fiscal year", the electric utility said.
Any potential impact on AGL's earnings from the 2018 fiscal year is currently limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its report by $187 million in view of the "imminent termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the steel plant or provide electricity to the steel plant".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that was due to expire in November this year, but it had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the closure of both the Portland Metallurgical Plant in Victoria and the Tomago Plant near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL's chief operating officer Stephen Mickelson said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants go out of business, there will be a significant drop in demand in the market.
For us as a producer, it will be bad", he said.
Not only is Kardashian the reality star, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of Kardashian-Jenner mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of American Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has walked the runway at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"I was in a room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and I cried", Kendall wrote.
The cover story was accompanied by a bizarre (or just Kardashian-esque?) reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the ex-wives of Rob and Caitlin, also joined by the show's most beloved uncle, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest), forgot about their sister's appearance on the cover, and at the end - a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
This is the standard story line of almost every episode of a children's television show about a birthday (Secrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the 8 a.m. show), but Chris needed that fame to somehow reach other girls.
Because with this episode of the September issue of Vogue, we have definitely entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Although her older sister Kendall Kim has been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling issue of Vogue for the year.
The issue, which is more of a gift edition than a fashion magazine, attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionista portal, 615 pages of last year's 832-page edition contained advertising).
News of which stars will be on the cover is so eagerly awaited that the magazine's photos have been merging for the past two years before the official announcement.
Previous women to appear on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrity models" than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was given the honor.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, described by the magazine as "the outstanding model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she's in good company.
These celebrities aren't relatives of celebrities, reality stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner falls into all of those categories).
These are really talented women who are making it in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, it was one of the most successful years in her career with the release of her album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, given her past as a reality TV star, was always going to be precarious.
In June, Victoria's Secret's first model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment".
This mood was reignited by the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But there's no point in dwelling on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's showing for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you some Estee Lauder tonic.
She and all her sisters sell you their photos on their own apps, available for a paid subscription.
She sells handmade photos of her daughter Cindy Crawford to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's on a reality TV show.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are refused services in community legal centres, as the sector prepares for a further reduction in funding for activities already at the limit of their capabilities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people who have no way to fight unjust dispossession, and so on - have already been turned down for free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, already overworked, are preparing for further cuts.
Starting next June, these law centers are set to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
Queensland's Director of Community Legal Centres, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census report from the National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are constantly underfunded: this means that thousands of people are being denied vital services they need", he said.
People leaving abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorce, workers being unfairly fired -- all of these people have legal issues, and this report shows that they're not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less protected Queenslanders will be forced to handle complex legal issues without help.
We urge the Attorney General and Senator George Brandeis of Queensland to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to address the needs of community legal centers and communities, their clients, and the Plumber's government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign headquarters is being sued after an employee allegedly threatened him with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's campaign headquarters have been sued for allegedly failing to act after reports that his North Carolina operations director threatened a staff member with a gun as they drove in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he waited months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized "that's not going to happen".
Principal Earl Phillip "took out his gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and aimed the barrel at Vincent's kneecap",  Bordinelli claims in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, the letter said.
"Pistols don't have to fire to do damage", Bordigini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after the Republican presidential candidate made headlines by telling listeners in North Carolina that "Second Amendment people" - those who own and like guns - could act if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and can choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he was not speaking in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign staff for negligent oversight, and from Phillip for threatening physical violence, insulting behavior, and causing moral harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks is delaying a request for comment.
Attempts to speak to Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one immediately returned the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg County Superior Court, Charlotte.
Britain must redirect the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow .
Heathrow will also bring a revival and prosperity not only to our local communities and to London in general, but to the whole country.
I think that was the huge advantage of Heathrow, just like London 2012, where we did everything we could to make sure that our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics were a huge benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for local residents and businesses around Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like London 2012, there will be those who think the Heathrow expansion is too big a task.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked about him.
Like the Heathrow Olympics, it's an infrastructure project for the majority, not just a select few.
The expansion  is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and within budget, from T5  voted the airport's best terminal for five years running, to T2 built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they're ready to provide a third runway backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I'm sure Heathrow's expansion will be too.
It's time for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton  Chairman of Heathrow Council and former Trade Attorney to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook are playing cat and mouse on ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad-blocking software is a game of cat and mouse, according to one company that makes such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users can update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims it's been able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth between the open source ad blocker community and those trying to get around it has been going on since ad blocking was invented", and it's possible that Facebook will present its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social network has joined the fight is a clear indication of how big of a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users who access Facebook on mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook's mobile apps for social networking and Instagram, according to a spokesperson.
But still, desktop advertising is a profitable enough product for Facebook to see as a worthwhile investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced it was updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook said that new Adblock filters were a concern because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to fix this", a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a crude tool, so we instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman hit on a Swiss highway in apparent suicide .
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit by multiple vehicles on a freeway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was lying on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill herself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, struck several vehicles, including a truck.
She died instantly.
Several of the drivers involved have been questioned, but some are still unaccounted for, police said, urging them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a "logical" step in such a situation, said lawyer Gille Hoffstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Could the impact have been avoided?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine", Hofstetter said.
Two other similar incidents in the last five years suggest that the drivers will not be held liable.
In each case - both involving a man walking in the dark on a freeway - the ruling was that motorists cannot expect to encounter a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne on a night in August 2014.
22-year-old victim was drinking and passed out on the road, court heard.
The court found that the female police officer who responded to the emergency call had been operating the vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA's new climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Nassau have developed a model for studying Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have conditions similar to Earth's.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus's low rotation rate was due to its dense atmosphere.
But recent modeling suggests that Venus may have had a thin atmosphere similar to Earth's and still rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid regions than Earth, but it once had enough water and enough geographical variability to support life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"According to the GISS model, Venus' slow rotation exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months at a time", explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella to protect the planet's surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average climate temperatures that are, surprisingly, several degrees colder than today's Earth.
The model shows a history of Venus similar to the development previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus may have once been habitable, it has been subjected to extreme heat and ultraviolet radiation for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen was gone, all that was left was a dense atmosphere of deadly greenhouse gases -- that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is stepping down as Avalanche coach.
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's executive vice president/chief manager Joe Sack confirmed the news and noted that the club would begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I spent the summer thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team, give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with the vision of the organization.
He should also have a say in decisions that affect the team.
These conditions are not met at this time.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today", said Saquick.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy was the recipient of the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 record in the 2015-2016 season and trailed the Wild by five points in their bid for the second-place Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups  two with the Montreal Canadiens and one with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Workers' strikes over North Sea oil workers' salaries have been suspended and all sides are moving to a new round of talks, leading officials said.
Strikes against the Wood Group oilfield service company have been sporadic on Royal Dutch Shell's North Sea platforms.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of negotiations to resolve the ongoing disputes", the joint statement said.
We're going to have a few full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to look at the issues in a fresh light.
The unions said their recent strike, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was aimed at potentially cutting wages by up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates for its contract workers in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market tensions.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent rate cut for contract workers working on the shore in 2014.
The company says the additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to cut oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations following its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the fall in crude oil prices: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union taken by the UK in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes to emerge in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the many, not just for the few", he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea are expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation of stars in the Pleiades.
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of the rotation speeds of the stars in the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and how rotation periods are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system", said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology, in a press release.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning faster than they'll ever spin again.
At their peak rotation rates, these rising stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds act as brakes on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots  such as sunspots.
The latest rotation speeds catalogue suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make their pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades ballet, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually very light stars", said Riball.
Because the Pleiades are so close, they're a perfect space lab for comparing the properties of stars to their rotation speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both young and old", says Riball.
We still want to know more about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and nail their dancing shoes, so to speak.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotation rates in three new papers that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Two agencies are investigating the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea, the newspaper "Kommersant" reports.
The FSB is gathering evidence of the detainees' involvement in preparing sabotage in Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, confessed.
According to him, he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armenian, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields as objects for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all the conspirators have been apprehended.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of the suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov is the head coach of Russia national football team
At the meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national team.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the RFU Executive Committee appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russia national football team.
He is a well-known footballer who previously played in the Moscow "Spartak" on the position of goalkeeper, as well as a coach with a solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as the same "Spartacus", "Pearl-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo", as well as Warsaw "Legija", which became the winner of the national championship and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is his responsibility to prepare the national team for the 2018 world championship.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to take the Russian national team to the semifinals and win medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considers creating a competitive environment in the team as his first priority and is going to give the players an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov, the Russian national team will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly match with the Turkish team.
Recall that earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian national team was held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching in the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
He took responsibility for the team's poor performance.
Squeezed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during its long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country of 2.4 million people has made tremendous progress, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government is putting a lot of emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education for granted, in many poor countries, secondary and even elementary schools charge tuition.
Moreover, governments are often advised to charge for education to "reimburse the costs".
However, in Namibia, primary schooling is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has become free.
The authorities are also working on other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 percent in the last decade.
Contrary to the international trend of increasing inequality, in Namibia it is decreasing.
Compared with 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality, has fallen by 15 points.
At that time, 23 years ago, it was one of the highest rates in the world.
And the poverty rate has dropped from 69 percent in 1993 to less than 30 percent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (on less than $1.90 a day) also fell, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rate in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has significantly outpaced the United States and other rich nations.
The country also has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - on the "Corruption Perceptions Index" compiled by human rights activists at Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia is managing to maintain its high growth rate.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than a third of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least by traditional methods of measurement, remains quite high - almost 28%.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS, with almost 17 percent of the population infected.
The World Bank has ranked Namibia as an above-average income country, but the authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the challenges of a weak economy.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
The country's desert is home to isolated nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes who must somehow integrate into modern society without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the fringes of the global economy a quarter of a century ago is a challenge for any country.
For Namibia, it is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
But Namibia has not given up, and the country is tackling its problems.
Almost immediately after independence, the government began to build a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
Remarkably, the rival political factions came together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides low-cost health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical facilities in the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians have realized that they don't choose their neighbors, so instead of fighting with them, they've decided to cooperate -- sharing scarce water resources, participating in regional health projects, encouraging investment and student exchange.
Furthermore, the Namibian government has rightly reasoned that the abundance of natural resources can easily become a curse, enabling the few to enrich themselves at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from Namibia's natural resources must be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek to maximize profits from the sale of a country's resources, and they are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why strong government support for free speech is so important.
As the head of state Hage Geinhof noted, the media often say things he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend its freedoms, says the president.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhaustive.
Some, such as fishing, are renewable, and the government is making efforts to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country each year.
Namibia shows that even countries that start with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and low development - can be on the path to shared prosperity.
Her achievement is internationally recognized and imitated.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects ever created by man (4600-4200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps the most famous archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during excavations at the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand weighing 6 kilograms.
Only one burial, known as "tomb No. 43", yielded 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon be passed to the unsightly bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunatsite is located far from the sea, near Yunatsite village of Pazarjik district.
The bead is a gold band wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyadjiev, the head of excavations at Tella Yunatsit, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it was at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
The Varna treasures date from about the same period, 4600-4200 BC.
There is no technology that can date a metal with perfect accuracy.
How can we be sure which gold is older?
Apparently, Professor Boyajiyev knows more than he told Reuters: "I'm absolutely sure that the gold of Yunatsite is older than the gold of Varna".
This is a find of extraordinary importance: it may seem small, but it is large enough to have a place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadjiev said that scientists will soon analyze the metal's composition and re-examine the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
It will help us date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location explains a lot, too.
Tell Yunacite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Today, Tell Yunatsite is considered the oldest city in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, the region saw a boom in metalworking, from the first metalworking skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community has a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, settlements of urban type began to appear around the metalworking centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunatsite is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts dating back to 4900 B.C.E. have been found here.
I would call Tell Yunatsite the prototype of a modern city, even though it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is a place a thousand years older than Sumer", says Boyajiev, referring to the commonly held view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq.
The first cities in the usual sense of the word were founded there.
The excavations of Tell Yunacite have been going on since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated nearly 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
Remains of a fortress wall were found, which once reached three meters in height.
Little remains of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, dense urban development, "business center" and residential areas.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the "Birds' City": dozens of clay bird figures have been found here.
All the birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the suggestion that they were not decorative objects, but the object of local worship.
The "bird city" was destroyed about 4100 B.C.E. - possibly by Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
The nomads didn't have cities, but they had horses and guns.
The three-meter-high fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal slaughter: Inside the houses, the remains of old men, women, and children were found with marks of battle axes.
New discoveries and facts are emerging each year, changing the way we have traditionally understood human history.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
The "Varna gold" found relatively recently, in 1972, was a powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization.
Logically, the gold luxury of Varna must have been preceded by something - something like a tiny gold bead created at Tell Yunatsit.
Porsche has artificially aged the 911 Targa .
It is officially stated that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being prepared manually by the unit's specialists who work with the production cars.
The "retro look" is, for example, the special Etna Blue body color, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the model logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the tender received a white graphic along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some details of the body design, painted in "white-gold metallic".
The interior is noticeably less retro-styled: it is distinguished by a gray-blue design, new chairs with expanded ranges of electrical adjustments and black anodized steel sills with the logo of the unit.
In addition, each buyer will receive a special version of the car as a gift, a case and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant was not touched by Porsche Exclusive specialists: the retro-tar is quite similar to the production one.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder turbocharged 3.0-litre engine developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be produced in a limited edition, but neither the volume nor the cost of each particular sports car are being announced.
Facebook and ad blockers have sparked an arms race
Facebook's recent introduction of technology that prevents hidden ads on social media pages has prompted developers to block ads in response.
AdBlock Plus has released an "antidote", but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has been advertising its new technology, which will probably be effective for a short time.
The social network said that in an effort to trick the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, AdBlock Plus' solution blocks many regular posts from friends or pages along with commercial ads.
Facebook has expressed regret over the AdBlock Plus policy and promised to resolve the issue soon.
A source among the social network's developers told TechCrunch that the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's desktop site will be ready in the next few hours.
The social network and the blockers have thus started a sort of "arms race" to outdo each other, with users who missed interesting posts from friends or saw ads in places they were not used to seeing the ads being the victims.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated recently.
The rapist will be brought to justice in Murmansk.
His case has already been completed by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation in the Murmansk region.
The charge against the 54-year-old man is a very serious one, sexual assault.
The investigation has established that in late November 2015 the accused committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl in the Pavlov street area of Murmansk. The criminal case with the approved indictment was sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years imprisonment.
Dongfeng to bring to Russia crossover Fengguang 370 and Rich New pickup - site at the wheel www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the car class gaining popularity in China, combining the merits of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms have decided to ignore the Moscow International Auto Show this year, so the empty Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation will be a powerful front, which has a great view on the Russian market and intends to offer our car enthusiasts a number of interesting innovations in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover , which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55 900 yuan (a little less than 550 thousand rubles at the current rate).
The Russians are unlikely to see such a price tag, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370 managed to reach the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans in June, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic frame on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be classified as a crossover.
The Crosswan is based on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger Fengguang 360 model, the 370 has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The cabin is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical touch screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossover, and cars with "music" were sold more simply.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading platform with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the luggage compartment is 1500 l.
The Fengguang 370 engine is a 1.5-liter gasoline "atmospheric" with 115 hp, coupled to a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer is modest about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises a budget-conscious owner an appetite of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a well-known Nissan NP300 Navara from the previous generation, but with a slightly upgraded design by Chinese stylists.
Despite its morally outdated design, this model is still in steady demand among Chinese consumers as a reliable and unpretentious "workhorse".
At a similar price, Rich New will probably interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become excessively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: a 2.4 L (137 hp) petrol or a 2.5 L (116 hp) turbo diesel.
The gearbox is just mechanical, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly connected "front".
Dongfeng will also be presenting a new flagship sedan A9, which the Chinese firm announced its Russian premiere in June.
The Chinese market is seeing a growing number of minivan-like crossovers, with the latest being the Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng lineup consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the first seven months of this year, the Chinese company's dealers have sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications on transport tax will stop being sent by mail - website At the wheel www.zr.ru
The IRS has changed the way property taxes are sent.
All Russian car owners are used to the same scheme: in summer and autumn they receive by mail receipts for the payment of transport tax for the previous year.
But this year, many will not wait.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for notifying citizens without any noise.
Those who are registered in the "Personal account of the taxpayer" on the official website nalog.ru, the notification will come in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians as online users and deleted them from the standard, "paper" mailing list.
The new policy will affect all vehicle and property owners.
Everyone else will still be getting their usual mail.
However, there is a possibility for those who have a website account to go back to the old scheme.
To do so, they will have to go to the tax office and write an application during August.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal account" immediately after the draft, while the letter will go for several days and may be lost.
In addition, the number of Internet users of the tax inspectorate has exceeded 18 million, which will allow the agency to save significantly on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed procedure.
Some may have signed up for a one-time service and forgotten about it long ago.
These people won't wait for the mail and will be unknowingly classified as nonpayers with all the consequences.
Access to the "Personal Taxpayer's Account" is available in three ways: through the gosuslugi.ru portal account, by electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
You can get it in person at any tax office (regardless of where you are registered).
We remind you that this year, the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
The notification started in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, which has been refined to achieve very high performance, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the G-Power company, which took on the task of modifying the Mercedes-AMG G 63 sports version.
G-Power is known for its obsession with BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its makers.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63-571 flying axe with the aerodynamics of a tank and a speed of 100 in 5.4 seconds?
By inflating the "muscles" of the crazy "helic", the masters took advantage of the advantages of the 5.5-liter inflatable "eight".
But the acceleration to 100 has improved by an indistinguishable 0.1 second, and now the flying brick can leap in 5.3 seconds.
However, acceleration from medium speed is probably much better for him.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not go faster than 210 km/h, the tuning SUV with the deactivated electronic "collar" can squeeze out 250 km/h.
The car is virtually indistinguishable from its factory source, except for the other 23-inch Hurricane RR wheel discs, 305/35 ZR 23.
Mercedes-Maybach has announced a stunning 6m long concept coupe that will be presented at the Pebble Beach Elegantness Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green subbrand" BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
At least four new environmental innovations are expected in the coming years.
