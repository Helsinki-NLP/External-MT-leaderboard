Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law introducing administrative liability for violating the terms and order of payment for goods (works, services) when purchasing for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve the very acute problem of non-fulfillment of obligations by customers when carrying out public and municipal purchases.
Two years ago, the situation of entrepreneurs not being able to get paid for government and municipal contracts that had already been executed was widespread.
Then the President of Russia gave the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who made contracts without financial backing, tried to evade their payment obligations, and included illegal terms in contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the prosecutor's office has submitted 9,7 thousand submissions, according to the results of their consideration, 4,5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 to administrative, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigating bodies for organizing procedural checks, 46 of them criminal cases have been initiated.
The result was a debt of more than 66 billion rubles to the entrepreneurs.
And the vast sums of money accumulated were far from the result of a multibillion-dollar default.
The debt has been so great that many entrepreneurs have been systematically delayed in paying their services for much more modest amounts.
Here's a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition to provide social transportation services for several million rubles.
The man put all his money into the bank, fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial pile of debt, including salaries, taxes, and loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought help from the prosecutor's office.
The problem has been brought to a minimum in a number of regions.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt levels continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor's office works in a manual anti-crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor General personally holds outbound meetings with local authorities, where all violations discovered by the prosecutors are examined in detail and measures taken to immediately eliminate them.
Such operational meetings have already taken place in Yaroslavl and Ekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in the Part of Establishing Administrative Responsibility of the Official Persons of the Customer for Violation of the Term and Order of Payment of Goods (Works, Services) When Purchasing for State and Municipal Needs" will be able to improve the payment discipline of public buyers.
The bill was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by a customer's official of the term and order of payment for goods, works and services during state and municipal purchases.
If the official has already been sentenced for a similar offense, he will be disqualified for one to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
A civil rights group has issued a travel warning in Missouri .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Travel Warning, effective August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to exercise extra caution and caution when traveling in the state in light of a number of suspected racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are listed here".
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the movement warning was prompted by a recent law in Missouri that made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement officers' disproportionate targeting of minorities.
You have people who are subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed", Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
We hear complaints more often than ever before.
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as the racially humiliated treatment of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while on a state trip, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office that found that black drivers were 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is to make people aware and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
People should be prepared in one way or another whether they take bail money with them or inform relatives that they are traveling across state lines.
According to the FBI's latest hate crime reporting program, Missouri had 100 hate crimes in 2015, making it the 16th largest state in the nation.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to sue a legal entity for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings in Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration control laws that ordered local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said should increase racial screening.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, NGOs have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknown gunmen opened fire on a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, the interior ministry said.
Two people, including a policeman, were killed and three others were injured.
All the wounded have been taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on the law enforcement officers.
One of the assailants was apprehended, the other managed to escape.
RTU supports the law on cancelling free baggage for non-returnable airline tickets
The head of the Russian Tourism Ministry Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC that he was "positive" about the adoption of the law on the abolition of free luggage transportation for non-returnable air tickets.
"We need to create conditions where a person who does not have baggage can buy a ticket cheaper than someone who has baggage", he said (quoted by TASS).
Mr. Safonov noted that despite the concerns of citizens, it will not be necessary to pay for carrying outerwear and mobile phones in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to say that this has nothing to do with outerwear, umbrellas, mobile phones, iPads or even computers", said the head of Rasturism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that allows airlines to exclude the free baggage requirement on non-returnable tickets.
The airline can decide for itself the number of seats and weight of the baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin has ordered to eliminate pollution in the Bay .
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on Baikal protection that large areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution in recent years.
He ordered the funding sources, plans and executors to be identified to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered a full-scale rehabilitation of the contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the cleaning facilities of most of them are worn out", - quotes "RIA Novosti" the president.
He also added that the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia should conduct an investigation to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the lake area associated with the appearance of natural landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
"I want to emphasize that not everything is checked, but that the measures are illegal and harmful to the environment and that appropriate measures are taken", he said.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin said in a direct line that the law needed to be changed to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of special protection.
The problems with the conduct of economic activity were reported to him by the residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskaya immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, because the restrictions are related to a number of normative acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economics proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple is to be built in Yugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the community of indigenous peoples of the North "Rakhtinya" together with residents of the Berezovsky district are taking part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of the saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Located on the riverbank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now the dome is installed, there are church bells.
The Igrim REB fleet provided transportation.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as he is venerated by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sośwa, fisheries provide jobs and food for the settlers.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school essays as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws enforced in Singapore?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while he carefully stores the cigarettes in a metal box he brought from his office.
After the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn, a hundred yards away, and throws the bulls in.
The fine for dumping garbage in a public place is $500 local, Chang said.
You know, I've had a reflex since I was a kid, you can't throw a candy bar across the road, you get a ticket.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed, the sidewalks in downtown Singapore are as clean as a museum.
Chang says that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son graffitied the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to probation.
What?!
I mean, imagine that.
He received ten wooden batons on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We have a lot of corporal punishment.
The high standard of living and the harsh laws in Singapore were explored by the AIF.
No one is thinking of abolishing the death penalty here, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been indifferent to what the European Union and the United States think about this.
If a person carries a large quantity of drugs or sells them, he is hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian man was arrested at Changi Airport carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
The Australian prime minister, international human rights groups, and even the pope have come out in his defense, threatening sanctions.
But the guy was hanged anyway.
After that, the drug runners are painstakingly circling our country.
The thing is, in Singapore, the law is supposed to be obeyed by EVERYONE, not just the poor and the rich.
It doesn't matter who you are, a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a European Union citizen.
The only option in this case is if they find half a kilo of cocaine in your possession, you're hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you see signs with warning signs everywhere, you're just amazed at how much is prohibited in this city-state.
For example, chewing gum is only available in pharmacies and can be purchased strictly on a prescription.
Tourists don't get chewed on arrival, but if they stick gum on the subway, they get a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around their necks saying, "I'm a garbage man".
In addition to fines, a cigarette can often be sentenced to "conviction in a prison": a week of cleaning parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. The "criminal" who forgets to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to do a small needle in the elevator of the house, a special detector works - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Some of the most exotic laws include bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public singing, and even excessive watering of indoor plants (!).
To avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters on the subway, or they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
So, you get the idea that no matter how hard you try, you're bound to break something.
That's not true, says Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, owner of a local travel agency.
The most fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years I have not seen anyone convicted of breaking them.
Why are they preserved?
So the citizens don't get too comfortable.
The basic rules are strictly observed.
For example, if a cigarette is sold to a minor at a cigarette stand, the store owner will pay a large fine, the offender will be beaten in the back, and the seller will also be flogged and imprisoned.
It is because of such strict laws that crime is very rare in Singapore.
Is that justified?
Back in the 1970's, we had a lot of chaos on the road, with drivers ignoring traffic lights, driving as they pleased, getting drunk and driving.
After the fines, it's been a year since the whole thing went down.
Now the driver, having drunk a shot of whiskey, knows that if he is stopped, the cop will not let him go for the bribe, will fine him the price of the apartment and send him to jail for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a US visitor was horrified by the overall wealth of its residents, "the eerily clean airport" and "the cultured nature".
They say things like this are unnatural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be.
First day in Singapore, you're afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you're afraid to get on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to Little India, and suddenly there's a pattern breaking: plastic cups lying around the bus stop.
"What's that?" you wonder.
And that's how Singaporeans smile.
It's not the end of the world.
Not every "crime" like this gets caught on the spot, but you should know: If you get caught, you're not getting away with it - you broke the law.
Most of the time, that's enough to make a person behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
I was very careful when I was in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, because motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from tourists.
Downtown Paris is full of dirty tramps and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw trash in the dumpster.
Singapore, with its draconian fines and ruthless laws (including the death penalty), is the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
It's human nature, remember, and in Russia, nobody used to fasten their seat belts while driving until they got a ticket.
Although, in Singapore, it's not the fines that matter, it's voluntary compliance.
And you have to think, in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, no trash in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
I'm not gonna give you any physical punishment.
Otherwise, Singapore's laws are at least worth a look.
Nothing sacred about it?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting the statues.
Americans understand this as well as anyone else, hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdous Square in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologues in the Trump administration, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a heated argument with CNN reporter Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Let's face it, Miller didn't touch the statue itself.
A bunch of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty artists would lynch him if he tried to do it.
But he was attacking its meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when the pedestal was added with poems by Emma Lazarus.
As Miller groaned at Acosta, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.
The poem you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller's got the facts right, but as he says, it's not really about the story.
It's about the current sound of Lazarus's striking words, the only ones in which the state invites not just any immigrant, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of breathing free, / the miserable refuse of your abundant shores".
Never before have "unfortunate scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't a literary scholar -- he made it clear that Trump is not wanted in America.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it's really a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to have her words placed on the base of the statue after her death - knew full well that they were committing a purely political act.
The sculpture was intended to symbolize the connection between the French and American republics through a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a whole new name:
The combination of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
The boisterous Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist who heralded Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, bringing America's flame to a world in darkness: "Freedom is moving forward.
She carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way in the United States".
Against all the odds, Limbo really got the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as the tired, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships would see her after a long and often difficult voyage.
It literally means looking at the world through the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance at a better life.
Her statue answers them with words of hope and hospitality they long to hear.
And that's certainly not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to kindle the hatred that is their only source of strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eileen Doyle recalls the time when there were only two Scots in the British national team
Neil Blake, director of the UK Athletics Federation, said the 16-man Scotland squad at the World Championships would make a "significant contribution to the team game".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships, which begins on Friday.
Blake believes that Scotland is "birthing something special" and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and we're going to support them while they have the potential", Blake said.
"I've spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's because of what they've done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks what they've done is worth working on.
British Athletics: what they've done, we have to work with.
And people on the street think the same.
I don't know why it's like this, but it's absolutely brilliant".
Some of the Scottish lightweight athletes are in contention for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Moe Farah in the 5000m; and Eilidh Doyle, the team's chosen captain.
"Eileen is modest.
Her captain's speech was great", says Blake.
"Many athletes, whether they are Scots or not, and from wherever they live or train, have walked out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and genuine feelings that Elid instilled in her were remarkable".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will run the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says the 16 Scots in the British team is "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Championships was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Leading the field is Laura Muir, a middle distance runner who broke five British and two European records last year.
She's gonna run the 1,500 and the 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will be competing in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch: he has a successful season behind him, with victories in the British national team's qualifying competition and the annual competition.
Doyle recalls her first world championship, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only made the team but will in some cases be in contention for medals and fight for a place in the final.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but to know that your teammates voted for you and chose you is something very special for me", she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who have been in the squad.
It shows how far we've come.
And they're all accomplished track and field athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I was just pointing out that we're very lucky to be hosting the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we're going to be in the Olympic Stadium again.
I've got another chance to go out there and compete, and it's going to be a great atmosphere".
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office unless you're ready to hear criticism from voters
The founders of our country knew what critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from his domestic policies to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he didn't shut up his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "You can take away freedom of speech and we, the deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughter".
Now I'm going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And this week the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's staff called the lawsuit moot, and the online commentary was "so what".
"It's just Facebook", many people would say.
But that's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly Democratic state.
He's second in the nation's top 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has shown a firm hand in running the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as his primary means of communicating with his constituents and jokingly shows off his bald head after chemotherapy on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and is run by administration staff on taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, saying that blocking comments is simply moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and hackers that are rampant on the Internet.
The Post talked to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls -- teachers, businessmen, pastors, who are addressing their elected leaders.
All of them say their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible to show that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hate but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment saying I was disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news", she wrote in the comments section of the Post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it's so-called "screwing" instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens".
What the governor's staff calls a "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call an "active life stance".
In the age of Facebook, it's easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It's a much less dusty job than before, when it required sending people in, collecting and burning newspapers with critical editorials, or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, just in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not listening to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, groundbreaking decisions on this issue was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James K. Cashearis of Alexandria, the chairwoman of the Laudon County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, the era of affordable postal services was about as revolutionary as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letters greatly eroded his reputation.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People using the aliases "Eurycola", "Valerus", "Belizarus", and "Porcius" wrote letters to the newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Papers online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and expression is at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a little more comfort at the Renaissance Club .
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a comfortable stay for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Open Senior Golf Tournament.
The Northern Irishman, who led the neighbourhood at the Archerfield Links and was on his way to the final round last year before losing to Paul Ilse, has been appointed to the new role and is acting as tournament representative on behalf of club founder and director Jerry Sarwadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built and we are watching it succeed with this event", Rafferty said.
The players will see this field at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He's a big fan of the game and proud of his accomplishments here.
It's a great demonstration for this field.
The Englishman Ilse is looking forward to defending his first title, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling", said the Southport player.
I couldn't try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It's magical to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back, and for me and my wife Sharon, it was a very special feeling to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we'll always remember it.
Returning to the fight in his homeland, Gary Orr, joined the European Senior Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you're playing at home, it's always a little bit more important", said Orr, a Helensboro resident.
You want to perform well, but you feel like it's an extra burden.
I was very happy to play again, and I played good golf.
I'm happy with the way things are going so far.
On the field, this trio will be joined by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Major champions Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entry fee is free, and parking costs £5 per hour for one person and £10 for two or more.
All proceeds are going to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb emissions
Highway tunnels that can absorb carbon dioxide from cars are already being tested on UK roads.
The country's transport agency, Autocar, reported positive results in testing a 100-meter tunnel on a highway in the north.
The 20-foot-tall tunnel is made of some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances in car exhaust.
However, the creation of a network of tunnels is only one part of a larger effort by the UK government to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are planning to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce traffic on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport with electric drive and modernize the heavy truck fleet.
Official statistics show that a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transportation, and poor air quality is responsible for up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
Moscow city court changed the sentence of a disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow city court changed the sentence of Anton Mamaev, a disabled man, who was sentenced to four and a half years in a colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the sentence with a suspended sentence, explaining its request that Mamaev's illness "prevents him from being in prison".
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with time served in a general colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, the court at a visiting session in the SIZO released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Golden Land
When preparing lunch, Bardina Degei does not use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarothali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually just places a sweet potato, called nota, right in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred clover is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
DeGei sits on the ground floor  she has no furniture  and it is here that she does her chores, such as washing clothes in muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she was not assigned to work in the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one dares to walk in the countryside after five o'clock", she says.
It's a rare opportunity to see everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by publicly raising their hands to the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enaratali  is as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jaipur, the administrative center of the province, to Nabir, and then a five-hour drive by hired car.
There's no public transportation here.
The city of about 19,000 people is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of the steel are painted with rust in various reddish shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, have made it, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamei.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also the golden land of Indonesia.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran Company, is just sixty miles from Panicay, a high-mountain province about the size of New Jersey with 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced gold and copper worth about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves worth an estimated $78 billion.
This wealth, however, brings a single misfortune to the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains its stifling presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The demands for greater autonomy from the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden vein and are being ruthlessly suppressed.
Human rights activists claim that since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
The Asian Commission on Human Rights has said that the mass killings in the high mountains of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything", a 2016 report by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture, particularly frequent, as claimed by another report, rape and electrocution, and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to estimate the number of victims because incidents happen every week", says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The gaika was delayed as Papua's resources attracted an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese stalls, varungi, sell roast chicken and a mix of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
"Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at a cheaper price than the indigenous population in the traditional market", explains Abet Yoo, a 24-year-old from Paniay who moved to Jaipur, the provincial capital, for work.
Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua  the mama-mama (women) of Papua  lost their market.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and human rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter won the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, little has changed, and the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Djokovic, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice", Yow said.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Djokovic Paniai was tragically killed.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas carols at a bonfire in Enarothali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle burst out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javed Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers a short time later.
According to victims and witnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers fired on a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government building of the Election Commission, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuans men, women and children gathered on a football field outside a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought their ritual hunting bows and performed waita, a dance of the Papuans called meye pagos, running in circles and imitating the song of birds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation escalated, soldiers were given an order by internal radio: "If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot them", according to an official document seen by TIME magazine but not published by local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the district head of Kego Koto in Enaratali, sensed the danger and appealed to the crowd to disperse to their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I got a bullet in my left wrist", he told TIME magazine from the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but says the bullet came from the side of a line of soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were a lot of gunshots", he adds.
Alfius Youv, a local resident, was shot three times, his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, said.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", said Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
I saw he was dead... I kissed him.
General Yotje Mende, the senior police inspector in Papua, told reporters that his officers were simply "defending" their base because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Papua's police commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the murders didn't reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovic gave a fiery speech in Jaipur, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights violations.
But almost immediately, there were excuses.
Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some of them were in the '90s or early '00s.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed", he said.
Viranto then retracted his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to establish an organization to handle complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It's going to be decided by the court".
Viranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody 1999 East Timorese independence vote, said 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims in Panigai have met such statements with gloomy distrust.
"I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but there has been absolutely no change", says Johannes.
I'm tired of it.
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared", he says.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot.
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the people of Paniay are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came for me", he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in Deai, a district near Paniaya.
A clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take a man unconscious to hospital killed one person and injured 17 others, including children.
A man, 24-year-old Ravianus Dowe, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, villagers threw stones at the officers, who fired warning shots in response.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) opened fire on the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we were afraid of retaliation", said 29-year-old Domingue Badiia, who lives near the hospital and saw the rush of the wounded.
I hid in my house for two days.
The Deia Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be held accountable and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is causing discontent among the Mei, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green lands of central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for Free Papua (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM executives are from Panigai, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and unjustly detained by the military in recent years in Panigai under the pretext of "defending national independence".
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua, Panigai is considered a sad, forgotten place.
Poverty only increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enaratali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as unavailable.
People grow everything they eat here: mostly nut, but also some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can tend four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually store most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold at the local market.
The ten-ring note costs only 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has increased between the indigenous Papuans and the new migrants who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire Airport.
The few available jobs are usually for more educated and well-off migrants.
Papuan people rarely have the money or skills to run their own competitive businesses.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no work or money", says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The isolation keeps Papua from the eyes of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basil Longchan were deported from Papua for "insufficient coordination with relevant organizations" despite being granted rare permits to film.
According to Felim Keene, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Djokovic's campaign promises to lift restrictions on media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of media attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations  Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands  asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the wide-ranging and widespread violations in Papua, including the shooting in Panigai.
The same countries that have supported OPM in the past.
Arramanaat Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, has distanced himself from the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that  Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights abuses.
The locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jaipur on May 4, locals broke the silence by pleading: "We want freedom", according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
"The Jockis are a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting", says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Djokovic to know that the people of Panigai, besides living in the shadow of a greedy army, are in dire poverty and their education and health care are in a sorry state.
Gobai says that the people of Panigai, like other Papuans, consider their vote for Jokowi a debt he must pay.
"They don't want money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military compound.
Knowing that justice will probably never be served, they at least prevent the guilty from forgetting their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family", Jacobus says, not looking up.
What else were we supposed to do?
Fire has engulfed Dubai 's second skyscraper , the Torch .
A fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily evacuate the 337-meter-high, seventy-nine-story structure.
This is the second fire to hit the high-rise building, which is also known as the Torch, in two years.
The building was evacuated, no human casualties were reported, and there was no immediate news on the cause of the fire.
We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor", a resident of the skyscraper, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defence Authority, fire crews extinguished the fire at about 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide asylum for the victims.
The incident could bring back the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the administration of Fakela after the fire there in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the plaque  external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation and cladding of Grenfell Tower in London could have accelerated the spread of a fire that killed about 80 people in June.
Tourism growth in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
According to data obtained by the correspondent of the rus.err.ee portal from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel enterprises in the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period of the previous year.
The number of local tourists decreased, while the number of foreign tourists increased.
So, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12 944 to 12 525 people.
The number of Russian tourists increased most noticeably in the region - by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3885 guests from Russia stayed overnight in the hotels of Ida-Virumaa.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to his fans who was to blame for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his Instagram fans who is to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
He hasn't commented on the rumors yet, but today he posted a piece from the August 1 Vedomosti.
Malachov signed the photo with the tag "boss milkshake".
An article on how to prevent burnout and pay attention to the worker's condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the host could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer who took up the re-formatting of Let Them Talk, it becomes clear what he was so transparently hinting at, writes "KP".
As reported, TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on leave and has not signed a notice of termination from the First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal could be cleared up in the next few days.
Five soldiers killed in car bombing in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers have been killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Hilmand, RIA Novosti reported.
According to police, a car bomb exploded near a military checkpoint in Girishk County the night before.
20 people are known to have died.
There was another emergency in Girishka on Friday morning.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange.
The gun battle between the attackers and security forces continues.
Diver caught a shark on video biting his camera .
Diver and explorer Greg Skomal caught a shark on video biting his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by the US Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, where Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeast of the United States, Necn reports.
A man underwater tried to film a shark on a camera he held on a stick.
When the animal spotted a man, it swam up to him.
The shark started biting the camera, not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did this to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily have destroyed the device.
He also noted that this behavior of the sea animal was new to scientists.
The cause of a fight in the Ural military center has been revealed
A working group of senior officers from the Central Military District arrived at the Yelan training center where the mass fight took place to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
We've already learned some of the details of the fight.
According to the publication Mash, which appeared on the page "Vkontakte", the contract workers of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought fiercely because of the unmade bed.
It all started when a private named Sayyan flagrantly ignored an officer's order to patch up a sticking sheet.
The officers of the sixth company stood by him.
Sayana's got the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men were smashed in the barracks beds and sinks, broken windows.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fight.
The C.D.A. denied the knife-wielding.
The study found that at least one in five passengers in the United States carry prohibited items on board.
The study found that more than 20 percent of airline passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items through U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints into their luggage, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane with prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
A study of more than 1,000 people by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. also found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to deliberately trying to fly something that was prohibited by the ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Gen Xers.
The most common way to deliberately pass ATB employees is to bring food and water.
More than 3 percent admitted to deliberately bringing sharp objects through the inspection, and 2.2 percent of female and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted to knowingly bringing prohibited drugs on board.
The company said it studied passengers across the country to see how many of them had accidentally smuggled through airport security and how many had done so knowingly.
It is to be expected that the most likely to smuggle smuggled goods through the security checkpoints are those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what liquids they can carry and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of what the A.T.B. takes out are banned liquids.
A while back, people thought that ATB might consider books off limits.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not international.
EPA chief Pruitt has abandoned his plan to delay Obama-era emissions cuts .
The day after 15 states sued, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay Obama's rules designed to reduce emissions of air pollutants and smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency is now more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than under previous administrations.
He didn't mention a lawsuit against his previous position filed in federal appeals court.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline by which states must meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistencies with local solutions or obstacles to economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed to his current position by President Trump, has long been known as a consistent opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations that the chemical or gas-oil industry opposed.
Wednesday's sudden change of course is another legal defeat for Peyote's return to normalcy.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief exceeded his authority to try to delay the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by drastically changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling EPA's obligation to cooperate with states in the comprehensive process of timely enforcement of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed deadlines as the case settled", said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous role.
"We don't believe in regulating by lawsuits, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take our charter and the authority it gives us seriously".
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt could at some point again use his "deferral powers and other legally given powers" to ensure that regulations "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of course - after our lawsuits - is an important victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that covers their cities", Schneiderman said.
The New York lawsuit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is produced when common pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The smog can cause serious respiratory problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental advocates have welcomed Pruitt's sudden change of course.
"It's sad to think of the pressure that went into getting this perfectly logical step from a man who was tasked with protecting the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests".
IAAF Congress extended suspension of All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (WFLA).
The congress thus supported the IAAF Board for the Restoration of the VFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be maintained.
The extension of the suspension was supported by 166 people, against 21, TASS reports.
The IAAF Council report said that the IAAF had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the Council for re-membership, but that these conditions were not yet fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian light athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people who had been admitted to the IAAF championship.
The VFLA was disqualified indefinitely by the IAAF in 2015.
The report by independent expert Dick Pound of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was published at the time, which spoke of numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.

A painful defeat
In the 3rd round of the Fonbet-First League of Russia among PFL teams, the new Moscow "Himik" held a away match against the FC "Kaluga".
A little over 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the game was completely different.
The "Chemist" was not inferior to the opponent, but a moment of relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent loss to the Calujans with a score of 0-3, many predicted an easy victory for the hosts.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the new Moscovites were forced to count on themselves and acted from the defense, but from the position of strength.
In the first half, the Calujans were more creative and had the advantage of possession.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexey Sirotin, who repeatedly defended dangerous blows and gave confidence to his partners.
Unfortunately, in the attack, "Himica" lacked the effort and luck to put the defense of "Kaluga" in a dead end and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game was played on opposite courses.
The Novomys were more active in the attack.
The alarm bells for our team were the mistakes in the defense, which allowed the Calujans to create a number of sharp moments.
With 10 minutes to go, the Chemical seized a territorial advantage and launched several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Casualties played a role - they played the end more competently and calmly, waiting for their moment to take the goal.
After a dangerous attack, "Himik" moved the ball to the corner, the field owners passed it into the goal without resistance.
The goal was scored by Yuri Dubrovin.
In the report meeting, Chemik showed a good game, but suffered a disappointing defeat.
Our team is waiting for another outing - on August 11 at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the Eduard Streltsov "Torpedo" stadium, the newcomers will face the favorite of the "Center" group of the Ararat FC, which consists of Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come and support Chemical!
Meeting time and place of meeting of the new Moscow residents - 18 h 30 min. near the store "Magnolia" (Vostochnaya, 2, corp.
The composition of the "Chemist": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Goya (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belanin (Adoevts), Andreichenko (Lygin) is also included.
The press service of the club "Chimik"
According to the published transcripts of the phone calls, Trump was pressuring Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published decoded phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly saying he would not pay for the planned border wall.
The president of the United States scolded him for speaking out against the wall, and according to leaked information, told him, "You can't tell the press".
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
A published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated confusion.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States should take in refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous", "disgusting" and "stupid", and insisted that the agreement made by the Obama administration would make him look like an idiot because he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that it was the most unpleasant conversation he'd had all day.
The bodies of the tourists killed in Abkhazia were flown from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the Russian airline, which carried the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, took off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
At the final destination, the board will be met by the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor, Abkhazia's deputy minister for resorts and tourism Astayr Ahba told reporters.
Earlier, the representatives of the Republic's Emergency Ministry said that all the expenses associated with the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were taken over by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhazian leadership expressed readiness to pay relatives of the victims of the tourist explosions for travel and accommodation in the republic, but relatives sent only credentials to the republic for the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky of Gudaut district, two explosions occurred at the warehouse of rocket-artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the republic, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
This caused a fire in the warehouse, which caused uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the accident, two Russian citizens - Elena Polyakova, born in 1970, and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a sulfur-hydrogen source, were killed.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying severity were brought to the medical institutions of the republic.
There are currently seven people in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
A grand jury will examine Russian influence on the US election .
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia's influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be reviewed by the Special Counsel and will decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the jury's investigation, which began a few weeks ago, will be details of a meeting between the son of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Müller had previously promised to verify the details of the meeting in June 2016.
They've already been investigated by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. had previously said that he expected a compromise on the DNC candidate Hillary Clinton's staff from the meeting with Veselnitsky, but no disclosure documents were presented, and the conversation ended up being about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement about meeting Veselnitskaya was dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House said the president was not dictating, he was just using his authority, as any father would.
Penza vice mayor was detained at work
Penza Deputy Mayor Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on the orders of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, RIA Novosti reports.
No official word from law enforcement has yet been received, but the press service of the SC's security service has assured that they will follow up soon.
Penza City Hall has not commented on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She was in charge of urban planning and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Before that, she worked for a long time as the head of the State Housing and Construction Inspectorate in Penza region.
Irina Shirshina has three children, and it is noteworthy that she gave up maternity leave a year ago and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico has no spaceport or launchers.
But there's a space agency that was founded in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of a bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first man to travel into space.
Unlike the Soviet-era monuments that are being torn down in some countries, Gagarin's monuments, on the contrary, "walk the planet".
In 2012, the monument was erected in Houston, Texas, near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument was erected at the Royal Observatory to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first manned space flight.
There's a monument to Gagarin in Erfurt, Germany, where our astronaut was in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czechia) was spared demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th birthday, a statue of Yurius Gagarin was erected in Riga.
That's the first Latvian cosmonaut's name and surname, and he looks like he's 70.
Morse Ford murder: Activists lose Lynch trials on stage to call for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by the crowd in Monroe, Georgia, and roared toward the little Morse Ford Bridge.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The main character, a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit, pulled out a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The people inside were trembling with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams broke the silence as a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that took place on July 22 was only a setup.
But when the noose was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to re-play the night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the KKK.
No one was ever convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years, not one person has been arrested - even though we see them next to us; even though we know who they are", says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and a stone on our souls".
Brooks, 71, is a former congressman from Georgia who has spent his entire life fighting for human rights.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice", he says.
"We cannot move to healing and reconciliation until we have justice".
A coroner covers the body of one of the lynch victims at Morse Ford, July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of being involved in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always been keenly aware of the two linked motives of the lynchers: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that black citizens could vote in the primary that summer.
Around the same time as the election, the FBI reports that black gunman Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently over a woman.
Brooks says that rumors were circulating in town that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the child she was to have was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, posted a $600 bond to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of the prison and into the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of lynchers surrounded the car.
"Harrison is found to have organized and ordered the killings", concludes one FBI report.
"It's also clear that there was a collusion between state and city law enforcement, "which not only participated in the killings, "but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks calls it short.
"It was an attack on the right to vote", he says.
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in the city that if you register and vote, you will be the same".
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been directing an annual production of the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her play is vivid, it captivates the audience and it tells the story of the deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to look at, and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that's what's important.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch trials because they show us our own ugliness", she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or hear what I've been through".
This year's rehearsal began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - gathered in the room and listened to a polished review of the play.
Wade Marbow was the director with Green.
He's been the clan's chief for years, but he says it's never been easier.
"I feel like I'm dirty because that's not who I am", says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story, because we don't want to go back to that time".
In the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Raskona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, reprise their roles.
The play begins with Malcolm, enraged that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Rascón shouts back.
It's a hit.
And at that moment, everyone (at least all the black actors) burst out laughing.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What is it?" Asks Ascon.
He's worried and confused.
Am I overplaying my hand?
"No", Green says through laughter.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'nigga' back then".
"Yeah, yeah", laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to say the solid 'R'".
And so the energy in the room changes, and the discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone has to do the right thing, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Raskona says the "n" word, it's clear and sharp.
No human being laughs.
The play ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in a black mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and sings the sad song "Strange Fruit" by Billie Holiday.
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred spectators are wiping their tears and sweat from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of black and white people in the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show; many live right next door.
They all endured the heavy spirit of Georgia for nearly eight hours as Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until that point, the murders were just history, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems like their ghosts are hanging in the air.
As the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children lean over their heads, touch the paint that represents blood and the still bodies, and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead", one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and then it's over.
The actors drop the ropes from their necks and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the head puppet master.
Nick Raskona hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the performance finally falls on him.
"It's all right", one of the women whispers.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had your reasons".
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta are having a lively discussion about a play with a black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinski has difficulty finding words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to hear these horrible, horrible words and actions... from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you", she says.
"After that, I think lynchings still happen", she adds, "only now it's called police shooting".
In the other corner of the room, the attention is drawn to Tyrone Brooks, who is recalling his work as a human rights activist over dinner.
He says he's already started planning a show next year.
"The play is inspiring because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced but also teaches us", he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it".
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "Aggitation Saturday"
Moscow's Simonovsky court fined Alexei Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offence, provided for in part 8 of article 20.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the order of organization of a rally".
Earlier, Moscow's Simonovsky court judge Hyzyr Mussakayev finished the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny's staff, who was charged under the same article as Navalny.
Wolkov was found guilty and fined 300 thousand rubles.
Judge Mussakayev estimated the amount of leaflets distributed at the "advocacy Saturday" that Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on July 8 and 9.
After seeing the propaganda material that followed the participants of the Saturday, the police thought that the organizers had deliberately hidden its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to ask permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuyev petitioned to stop the administrative proceedings due to the absence of a law enforcement officer and pointed out that the police had made certain mistakes in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the "agitation Saturday" itself, but he received a summons requiring him to appear at the police station to tell about the event, which he had actively participated in.
The same summons was issued to Navalny and another opponent, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia , a man shot and killed a bride and three wedding guests
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local man for shooting four people at a wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the Republican Department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the fight, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event who came to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been opened under article 213 (1) (a) ("Holiganism"), article 30 (3) and article 105 (2) (a), (e), (i) ("Attempt to kill two or more persons, committed in a generally dangerous manner, with hooliganism as a motive").
According to the Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the wedding guests decided to swim and went to the water.
Energy Ministry toughening requirements for power plant turbine suppliers
The Russian Energy Ministry will update the rules for providing information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, hydropower turbines, oil pumping and oil production facilities are put into operation, equipment suppliers will be required to share access data with the Energy Ministry and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government decree is ready and is being put to public discussion.
The new requirements will only apply to "critical energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
The document identifies as potential threats the obtaining of information and access to the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The European Union has extended anti-Russian sanctions over Siemens
The European Union's press service said on August 4 that the anti-Russian sanctions were expanded because of the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by "Arguments of the Week".
The EU Council's press service said the sanctions against Russia were expanded because of the scandal with Siemens turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea in a circumvention of sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It was reported earlier that a final decision would be made before the end of the day, and the decision was made, sanctions against Russia were extended.
Pearson is cutting 3,000 more jobs and cutting dividends to get the business back on track.
On Friday, Pearson, a British education group, announced it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its initial dividend by 72 percent as it embarked on another restructuring program aimed at tackling the problems facing its business.
These job cuts, which CEO John Fallon said would mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans to cut another £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive businesses hit by the rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsmann, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced sales of the primary commodity rose 1 percent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed by suicide bomber
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were wounded, according to a NATO statement.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Karabakh city area.
The blast is the latest in a series of bloody attacks in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a mosque blast in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a "hand-held explosive device".
All of the wounded are reportedly in stable condition and receiving treatment at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bombing killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
A powerful explosion in the city centre on May 31 killed more than 150 people - the deadliest attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
The violence has highlighted the precarious situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs whether to increase the number of US troops assisting troops and police in the country.
According to the reporters, the attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency cancels the lawsuit to postpone the air pollution law
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed its decision to delay the passage of an Obama-era law requiring states to limit air pollution emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called 2015 ozone measurements, saying the move showed the agency's willingness to work with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and in being responsive to them", said Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to delay ozone measurements, which measure existing air pollution in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air quality standards, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit claiming that the intent was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But the move has drawn opposition from Democrats and environmental groups concerned about the potential health impact of large emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency website says that using ozone-containing air for breathing "can worsen lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
European business association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against Russia.
The AEB believes that such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and jobs.
The AEB statement says that business is an important link between countries and people, and therefore free trade cannot be restricted.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new policy that separates business from politics and finds a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask police to limit traffic on Pskov waterfront
Pskov people's deputies sent an appeal to the head of the UMID in the city Sergey Surin about the problem of moving along the banks of the river Velika.
The deputies of the city council Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Stronenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
They believe that controlling drivers will help make the area more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that offenders ignore the "Pedestrian Lane" signs and ride freely along the waterfront.
So the major renovations and improvements were for nothing.
Sports and playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of the cars.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, the central waterfront is patrolled by PPS motor patrol and brigade officers in the evenings.
They reduce the number of cars, but they do not stop traffic altogether.
Putin demanded that the investigators not seize hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to prohibit investigative authorities from seizing servers and hard drives from work computers at enterprises.
The head of state said this at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the use of measures that lead to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the seizure of hard drives from working computers and servers".
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, "it is enough to take copies, verify them and use them during the investigation".
The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the enterprise's activities to the point of being impossible to pay taxes".
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV presenter Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband, footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
The celebrity is currently in the United States, where she is working on labor issues.
Just the day before, Olga was in Las Vegas, and then decided to post on Instagram.
She said she never married, didn't get new tattoos, and didn't call her ex-husband and say he ruined her life, even though she really wanted to.
Buzova said she would remember the trip forever because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the adaptation of the Harry Potter series, has died at the age of 92.
This was reported on Thursday by the newspaper "Independent".
The actor's relatives told about his death.
According to them, he had lived "a tremendous life, achieving success in cinema, theater and television in a career of 70 years".
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959 he appeared with Laurence Olivier in the tragedy Coriolanus at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.
Hardy is also remembered for his many roles as Winston Churchill's Prime Minister, including one of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple adaptations.
For his performance as Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Cinematographic and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award.
Robert Hardy also played the role of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the president of the United States.
Something is rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his newlywed wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a golden wedding, but the agenda is not preparation for the celebration, but a heated argument.
His Highness refused the title of Prince Consort, while he scoffed at the Queen for never having granted him the title of King Consort.
Henry lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's husband.
Russia 's Foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop bullying Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to Mike Pence's comments accusing Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement about this a while ago.
In its commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War-era stamps that are not adequate for modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop bullying Russia.
As "Arguments of the Week" reported the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, and there's talk of a deciding match.
Wassily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seemingly are on a steady march to host the most exciting boxing match in the 147 pound weight class in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the second lightweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former world champion Erien Broner in four weight classes on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of weight class.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?"
Good luck to you.
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga Saturday night at 7:00 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be a good fit.
"I used to be in the lightweight division", Garcia recalled.
I've been upgraded for the Bronner, but I'm not that big.
I'm too young for 140.
I want to go down to the half-lung.
And he needs to get up to half-light, and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's get them that.
Lomachenko has agreed.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast via PPV as part of a strategy he has for Lomachenko to make his 135kg debut later this year to set up a fight with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in taking on the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the lightweight world title at the Forum Arena on September 23.
"The fight can be on PPV because all the fans asked for it", Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that offers the best financial terms.
We're the main names.
No other name would arouse such interest.
As soon as they're ready...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a "great boxer" and might go to his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately shower Garcia with praise, saying he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you were begging for a knockout".
Garcia said he was focused on showing off the punch, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension build up before their own fight.
This fight has to happen.
No other fight has generated as much interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the top fighters, and here he is, Mikey.
This is gonna be a great fight.

Putin instructed the Prosecutor General to check the Bay .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Russian Federation's General Prosecutor's Office to conduct a review of the Baykal area for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to check the Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities", Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take measures if violations were discovered.
New test results for age assessment of asylum seekers in Sweden published
Recent tests of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new medical age assessment method show that more than 80 percent of those tested were rated as over 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment of asylum applications more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
The Migrationsverket has so far sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the test subjects were assessed as 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases the forensic medicine agency assessed that the test subject was "likely to be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the verdict was that the person was probably under 18.
Tests are only done when age is in doubt.
According to Johan Göransson of the forensic medicine agency, the results are consistent with those of the past few months.
"We don't see much difference with the statistics from the past months, the numbers are quite consistent", he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases where people were assessed as 18 years old does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency released results from 581 tests and reported that 442 cases were "likely 18 years of age or older".
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases a person openly stated that 18 of them were coming this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves taking a wisdom tooth X-ray and a knee-joint CT scan and giving them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has also been criticized in some jurisdictions.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Carolina Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that we use now.
Biological age is not determined precisely.
If we can't define it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told Metro.
However, Gjöranssen from the forensic medicine agency spoke in favour of the accuracy of the tests: In general, it is possible to say that the risk of mistaking a child for a minor is high.
The greatest risk we face is when a person is about to turn 18, in which case it's about 10 percent.
I'll consider running for president.
During a working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to consider whether to run for the post of President of Russia in the 2018 elections, reports "Interfax".
This statement was a response to a request from residents of the village of Cheremushki in the Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election is held, we all ask you to run again for this post".
"Well, I'll think about it, thank you", the president said.
On July 28, Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the presidential administration head Anton Vino will head Vladimir Putin's election staff.
Peskov called these assumptions "baseless, hypothetical reasoning".
"There are no headquarters yet, but the creation of headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away", Peskov said.
"As long as it's not on the agenda", Peskov said.
The governor of West Virginia has announced he's switching parties.
West Virginia Governor, Democratic Party spokesman Jim Justice announced Thursday at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, I speak to you with much prayer and much reflection... "Today, I speak to you, the people of West Virginia:
The rally was met with applause.
"So tomorrow I'm changing my registration to Republican", Justice added.
As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play differently.
Earlier, Trump promised to make an important statement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by a 42 percent margin, and Justice did not support the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state's only billionaire, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that "Gov. Justice's move to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more a hindrance than a work in progress to make our country great again".
"Given the fact that we have only 15 governors and control the fewest state legislatures in history, the Justice Governor's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message", said Ronna McDaniel, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, in a statement to CBS News.
Mr. Handsome found a home on social media .
A daycare in Pittsburgh, North Carolina, U.S.A., has added a cat named Mr. Handsome, weighing over 40 pounds (14 kg), after it became famous on the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
In late June, a Facebook account of the nursery posted a photo of the cat asking to find its owner because "it was obviously fed by someone before".
In comments, users noted that the animal's face expression could become a new meme.
The publication has garnered more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
Dozens of people have expressed a desire to take in Mr. Handsome.
As a result, he was placed in the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN, she said that she had had a similar experience: She took home a cat weighing about 40 pounds [10 kg], and now it weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit users noticed an Australian cat with unusually long paws.
The post with the animal's photo has garnered over 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could have made a career in modeling.
Kou praised Russia for its " sincere " apology over the doping scandal
International athletics expert Sebastian Kou on Thursday praised what he called Russia's sincere apology over the doping scandal, but reiterated that now was not the right time to allow the country to compete again.
Russian representative of the Russian Athletics Federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin said at the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the world championship in athletics, that the suspension of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to all the athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen at the competition.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of state-funded doping.
"I thought today's answer, today's report, was very sincere", said Kow, president of the International Athletics Federation.
"The whole council and the whole congress is pleased... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation".
Kow said he also "liked" that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very constructive day and we're moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special committee that now is not the time to restore Russia to its rights", Coe said.
In the next few months, we must do everything we can to fix this situation.
Our guiding principle was to separate clean athletes from the tainted system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the world championship in athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements still needed to be met to restore Russia.
He told reporters in London after a report at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) board that drug testing was still not being done in sufficient quantity and that the suspended coaches were still doing their jobs.
A court has arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason.
Ukrainian security service (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky was detained for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the online publication "Zhitomir Journal" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and of violating Ukraine's territorial integrity.
Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the European migration crisis, Italy decided to launch a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol boat "Comandante Borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya to join forces with the Navy to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed to this with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country.
The Libyan parliament, which is opposed to the cabinet and based in Tobruk, accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave his subordinates orders to counter the Italian ships.
Rome, however, said it did not believe the threats and intended to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognised Libyan cabinet, Faiz Sarraj.
Italy's authorities set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on the number of illegal immigrants who have arrived in the country from Libya since the beginning of the year were published in July: 95,000.
The government said the resources to take in the migrants were exhausted.
There was a massive Skype failure .
A global outage of Skype service was reported today in several countries around the world.
Users began sending out mass complaints to the developers on Thursday, August 3.
Microsoft said that experts are already working to address the problems facing Europe and North America, RIA Novosti reports.

Two leaders of the Ukrainian team in athletics suspended from the World Championship
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in running at short distances, have been excluded from the Ukrainian team for the 2017 world championship in London.
This is reported on the website of the country 's Light Athletics Federation (FLAU).
The decision was made by the organization's executive committee in connection with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) initiating disciplinary proceedings against female athletes.
The Ukrainian delegation also excluded the coach of the country Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects the athlete of doping.
Povh is a bronze medalist of the Olympics-2012 and the world championship-2011, the champion of Europe-2010 in the 4 by 100 meters relay, Zemlyak - the winner of the 2012 European championship in the 4 by 400 meters relay.
The world championship in athletics in London will be held from August 4 to 13.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record-setting transfer of Neymar from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France.
Whatever consequences may come further down the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, whose power is to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
The financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 suggest that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to release the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG could certainly make a fortune to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on players, but they have to balance it against legitimate revenue to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that go into huge debt in their quest for success are in fact cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners stop funding.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on club debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
This change in business model, which was originally used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003  to buy a club with good potential, and then spend heavily in order to improve the team and create a world brand  became a difficult plan to implement.
During this three-year assessment period, which is 2018 in the making, the clubs could suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And even though Platini was disgracedly removed from his post as president in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
"Of course, the FFP is alive, and we will tighten the rules going forward", Andrea Traverso, UEFA's FFP controller, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay for Neymar's contract at once, it can distribute this sum over the entire term of his contract for reporting purposes.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer fee can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of sanctions against the FA in 2014, the FA imposed severe sanctions on the club, as well as the Abu Dhabi-based Manchester City.
PSG was fined €60 million (at that rate it is $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and was ordered to limit its squad in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating their revenue at the expense of companies linked to the club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the funding amount was deemed to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the amount of funding for the PSG from Qatar's Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG may have come in the form of payments from the organising committee for the 2022 world cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a move could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As people familiar with the situation reported on Thursday, UEFA had not held any preliminary discussions with PSG over Neymar's transfer.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the PJS situation.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-16, PSJ received more than 10 million euros in profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The last financial year's report has not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a good platform for sponsorship deals, sales of team attributes and T-shirts.
The club expects a turnover of at least 30 percent due to the new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best footballers is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that PSG would violate financial fair play.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' by the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, noting that the ultimate owner of PSG is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports mogul, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's state funding.
"This is all the result of participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
When the country owns the club, anything is possible.
It's becoming very difficult to keep financial fair play, because a country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The president will determine the order and place of the swearing in .
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies were planning to directly define the oath-taking procedure in the law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as the incapacitated, will be exempt from taking the oath, according to the revised text of amendments to the bill "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available in the "Izvestia"), which the committee will consider before the second reading on July 11 at its meeting.
The idea of introducing an oath when entering into Russian citizenship instead of formally signing documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with the State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading to the bill, which provides for the cancellation of the decision on the issuance of citizenship to those who were later convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the internet (part 2 of article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only in the case if this act is related to terrorism (part 4 of article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, the logic was that when a person signs a citizenship document, he is promising to abide by Russian law - by taking the path of extremism, he is breaking that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev ("United Russia"), Genny Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Justice Russia") and the speaker of the GD Вячеслав Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Department's Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for second reading, but it has now been revised again.
Now it says the oath-taking procedure will be set by the president of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the state emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, the text of the bill did not make it clear where such an event should take place - the list of places where the coat of arms of the Russian Federation can be placed is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, the offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive authorities, etc.
It could be the registration.
Those who want to become Russian citizens will take the oath after the officials check their documents.
But a Russian passport can only be obtained after taking an oath, according to the revised text.
A week ago, the bill said that the oath should precede the signing of the executive order.
The updated text says that Russia will take the oath at 18, not 14.
The rule that incapacitated or limited-functional persons, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the oath text by hand, are exempt from taking the oath was retained.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure "other persons",
The updated bill also stipulates a special procedure for accepting Ukrainian citizens who are considered Russian speakers.
They will have to officially renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an application to the authorized Ukrainian authority.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
The "foreign" citizenship will not be required to be renounced, as it is now, if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible "for reasons beyond the person".
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among whom the first vice-speaker of the GD Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalya Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, impossible.
Accordingly, many people are waiting for a decision on their fate regarding Russian citizenship, - explained the head of the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarifies that the restrictions on certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have written a written refusal to take another citizenship and have handed over their previous passport to the Russian Interior Ministry, but "for reasons beyond their control" have not ceased to be considered citizens of another country.
Now foreigners are prohibited from holding positions in municipal services, being accepted for work in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country cannot become a member of the State Duma or the Federation Council.
The law is expected to come into force on September 1, 2017, and the necessary legal acts should be ready by then.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of the story is nostalgically reminiscent of both the characters' glory days in the '80s; the grunge era in the '90s (around the time when the great masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy The State for MTV); and itself - that is, 2001 before its stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is both the elevation and the embodiment of our age with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of its absurd humor (including the original story about a talking vegetable jar, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result is double the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually preoccupied children who have just reached adulthood; this makes the impossibility of coming back into being part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", where the adults played the adults, has less emotional roots and its parody is more disorderly, and includes riffs from stalker films of the 1990s like "Hands Rocking the Cradle".
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller skates and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991".
A lot of the plot is the same.
The kindly Cope (Showwalter), now a writer, still has not gotten a return from Kathy (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And then there's the crazy and vile conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), now being instigated by George Bush Sr. (a seasoned parody performed by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the setbacks.
It's especially funny to see the ever-younger Rudd singing Matt Dillon's song from "Lonely", whose character, the once-big man Andy, now looks like an old man.
The franchise's success could be a series of random, recurring "Seven Up" crazes until it reaches what I think would be its logical conclusion, "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the final scene, the entire company would go to the movies for the premiere of "Hot American Summer".
Comrade Detective on Amazon addresses a different kind of nostalgia: Cold War memories from The Americans, The Exploding Blonde, or even The Shining with its depictions of the East and West struggling.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Reese Thomas, is a TV movie: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles - Gregor's life-seeing and idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersik Jr. and Cornelius Ulich, and their dialogue in English is voiced by Channing Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Lewit.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess match like Americans would watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes it interesting to play "guess the voice".
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask - that it often looks like one.
Six long episodes are long, and it's not funny very often.
If it were shorter, Comrade Detective could do better with its satire in the spirit of agitation; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby eating a bunch of hamburgers.
To the communist imaginary viewer, this image tells him that Western culture can make a fat trap out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do this even with our own recent history, and with theirs too.
The prize fund for the match for the Super Cup of Russia between "Spartak" and "Lokomotiv" will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the president of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pрядkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the Russian Federation Federation of Professional Leagues, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that at the moment there are almost no tickets left for the match.
The match between Spartacus and Locomotive will be on Friday, July 14th, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, "Spartacus" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young people cleaned a furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
A 37-year-old resident of Ufa, who owns a furniture company, recently called the police.
The man reported stealing expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The thieves took tools worth almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic cylinder, a winch.
The guards began to search for the criminals and soon came to the residents of the Благовещенский district of the Republic of Bashkortostan, friends 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs, the accomplices broke into the enterprise, broke the entrance door and took out the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first auto repair shop they came across.
The case has already been filed against them for theft, and law enforcement has only managed to return some of the stolen tools to their rightful owners.
State Department comments on Medvedev 's comments on Russia and the US
The U.S. and Russia should be able to work together.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the Russian government said that by imposing new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had ended the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war with Russia.
Commenting on the statement, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that "we need to look for areas for cooperation".
"Look at the ceasefire in southwest Syria, which has been in place for almost a month".
"This is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia", the diplomat was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
The Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the Russian prime minister's statement that sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
He also admitted that the document was a failure and contradicted the U.S. Constitution.
Dior has grown roses from amethyst and quartz.
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has added to the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
They have five new rings and three velvet-stripe checkered necklaces.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line has released two new rings and a necklace made of amethyst, rose quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of gliptic (hand carving on stone) and paving and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victor de Castellan, was inspired by the roses that fashion designer Christian Dior grew in his Granville estate, and the Parisian gardens of Bagatelle and Pre-Catalan.
Trump found the culprits in the deterioration of relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump has issued a sharp criticism of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine", the president tweeted.
Yesterday, Donald Trump signed a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
They will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House later released a statement from the president, in which he said the law would prevent the United States from making profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian subsidiary of Sberbank
Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokopenya withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention of "concentrating on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on".
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank's subsidiary.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of the Russian bank's Ukrainian division after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium of Grigory Guseľnikov and the Belarusian company of Said Guseľiev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of the blackout in Crimea
The Russian Energy Ministry has named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department Alexander Novak explained the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a road traffic accident in the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck hit the power lines, causing the Kuban and related Crimean networks to be cut off.
Power outages in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The technicians fixed the malfunction within hours.
Initial reports suggested that the blackout was caused by abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce interest rates unchanged later after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened rumours of a possible rise.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain sluggish and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on household incomes.
The bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members of the committee this month voting to raise rates because weak economic growth weakened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to 1.7 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018, and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, while it still expects inflation to rise to about 3 percent in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes over the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs would likely have to rise more strongly than expected in financial markets.
The committee also voted to drop part of a massive package of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close its urgent financing plan, which provides banks with cheap loans, although it has said it will now provide another £15 billion to £115 billion under this plan.
In a minutes decision on the rates, the bank said: According to the MPC's main forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth will remain slow in the near term, while pressures on real household incomes continue to affect consumption.
On the issue of interest rates, he reiterated that to halt inflation, "some tightening of fiscal policy" would be required, "somewhat more" than the markets expect.
At this point, markets are predicting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The bank's forecast for this and next year's increases is lower than the forecasts made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank kept its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth rates weakened the rising expectation of an increase; GDP then rose 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason for happiness to households hit by high inflation and very slight wage increases: the bank said the pressure would increase before declining.
The bank added that fiscal policy "cannot prevent" a drop in earnings in the next few years, but expects wages to "significantly recover" by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of rising demand for British goods, driven by a low pound exchange rate that offsets some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shock Brexit referendum resulted in a fall in the pound.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully affect prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final rate decision, the rumor about the proposed rate hike was growing as inflation pressured the already strained households: three experts on the committee asked for a rate hike to 0.5 percent in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 percent last month from 2.9 percent in July, although the bank said the drop was expected and will be offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like the mortgage market will become even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and look forward to a good year out.
The market looks particularly favourable for those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission and also at low rates, is becoming more popular than ever.
State health service to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" HIV drug after a high court battle over funding from the National Health Service.
England's National Health Service announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in those at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the NHS during an initial three-year trial period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP, despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was described as a "major innovation" by Simon Stevens, president of England's National Health Service, and a "tipping point" by the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT).
Before the programme is fully rolled out across England by April 2018, venereal clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, with more clinics to join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)  is a course of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV among people at high risk.
Taking PrEP before sex is a way to prevent HIV infection by taking a sufficient amount of certain medications.
These drugs can be taken daily or at least two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include gay and bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are HIV-positive and are not receiving successful treatment.
Clinical providers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and people whose partners are not known to have their HIV status contained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and registered with a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation at the nearest venereal clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the NHS in England signed a contract to supply the drug this week after an international tender.
The study was designed to evaluate the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who the drug's target audience is, its uptake and use on a large scale.
This important innovation should complement and reinforce the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT, said: "This is a watershed moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at people who are in need and at risk, can make a difference to the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, through this study funded by the National Health Service in England, will have access to a new, novel drug that you can control without talking to your partner, and that will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The first thing we need to do now is to make sure that the trial is rolled out quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that we have the experimental PrEP, we're on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people who are at risk for HIV.
Shadow public health secretary Sharon Hodgson said: "We very much welcome the start of the PrEP trial, which has been very delayed by months of delays and delays from the government".
The data shows how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this deadly infection.
This trial will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It's important now that the trial is rolled out nationwide as soon as possible to protect people at risk of HIV and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in our communities.
World Tatar Congress adopted resolution on supporting the Treaty between Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of preserving the office of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a form of organization of the highest state power in the republic that has been positively proven and expresses the national interests of the entire Tatar people".
In addition, the congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, social-economic and social-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
The agreement between Moscow and Kazan was signed for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and to keep the title of the post of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president".
Russia has difficulties getting international driving licenses
The D.I.Y.D. units are running out of international driver 's licenses .
The waiting list for such permits lasts for weeks, which has become a real problem for holidaymakers who want to go abroad on vacation in their own car or rent one.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licences remains controversial.
The EIA was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in a national ID card, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in practice, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require the MIA, while others have enough national rights.
Drivers still get international driving licences to get insurance, but it is worth noting that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or the MIA.
The problem with the forms is now observed in almost all the units of the State Highway Traffic Safety Administration, reports Kommersant, after conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, the U.S. Border Patrol units simply do not issue vouchers, and they have been missing for four months.
You can book an appointment on the state service website, but the line is already stretched to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get an I.V.U. "for technical reasons", without going into detail, in the Samara region they honestly say that there are no forms, similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, with more and more posts on social media:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
Right, because all the D.A.R.D. offices are out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question for people who know!"
We need international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, the time is always far ahead, the place does not give the ticket at all (the button is there, but the ticket can not give).
It's like the public service portal shows that the SPB has free time to fuck.
Has anyone tried getting in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for international driver's license forms have changed, so the subdivisions of the State Auto Inspection are being supplied with new forms.
This may be the reason for the shortage, although it is not clear what changes are involved, as this has not been reported before.
The Blankets are purchased by the Special Purpose Center for Road Safety (SPCD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivered to the DHSD.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak JSC: in 2014-2015 almost 200 thousand MVA forms were produced, in 2016 15 thousand were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was signed on July 18 with the First Printing House LLC for the manufacture of 70 thousand forms.
There is a theory that the CNA simply did not have time to hold the tender, which is why the shortage occurred.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people have started to travel independently to cheaper Asian countries like China, Thailand and so on.
It is not clear what rights are being taken out, so people are reinsured, and there is a huge demand for international "shortcuts".
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to take a test to prove their qualifications.
The Ministry of Transport has made such a proposal.
The new international driving licence (IDC) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
Ukraine 's justice minister refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukraine's justice minister, Pavel Petrenko, said he did not believe Russia could build a bridge to Crimea.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the "Observer".
No self-respecting international company will even put a pin or a hook in there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia over Crimea.
"That is, according to my deep conviction, this project has no prospects", Petrenko said.
He added that he considered Russia incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can't build anything smaller.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums have already started to fall apart.
"So I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that are too shortsighted to join this project", the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the vault of the automobile arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the construction of the Crimean Bridge's road arch has been completed: its vault is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the bridge builders prepared the railway arch for installation on the railway railway support", the project's information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar region.
A Spanish official was fired after not going to work for 10 years.
What angel-like patience (or total indifference to public office) was the boss of Spanish official Carlos Río to have?
The permanent absence stretched on for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was fired.
But not by his immediate superior.
Which is not the case in a bureaucratic world.
The common people seem to have long been used to all the crap of the "servant of the people".
Yet, officials are always able to surprise those whose taxes they live off.
This time, the sensation came from Spain.
There, Carles Resio, an employee of the Valencia Archives, managed to miss work for a full decade.
He was paid regularly.
And the whole thing is a solid 50,000 euros a year.
And now the "good old days" of Mr. Recio are over.
He was fired by the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
The investigation revealed that the malevolent stroller came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to be marked in the electronic system.
And I went home right away.
He showed up at work again at 4:00 to get another system record of him leaving.
That's 10 years.
It was also revealed that the stroller spent all his free time drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking about how to punish the direct boss of Mr. Resio, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace as his subordinate.
Judges are being offered protection from the chairmen
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (PCHR) has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of government on the instructions of Vladimir Putin.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the judges and introduce their electionality.
The Human Rights Council wants to introduce special districts for appellate and cassation courts that are not tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also make its own recommendations under the presidential mandate.
The Human Rights Council has completed the development of proposals to strengthen the independence of the Russian judiciary.
The JCC carried out this work on the instructions of Vladimir Putin dated January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with the members of the council.
At the meeting with the members of the Council on December 8, 2016, individual cases of arbitrariness of the courts were discussed, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "Ъ" from December 9).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals, which concern both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and detecting judicial errors, and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights activists is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If a candidate for the position of judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the president of the court, according to the HRC, should present him for appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the chairman of the right to distribute cases to be considered among the judges.
Experts suggest that a computer program may be used to do this.
The SPHR also considers that the chairman is not entitled to "predetermine the results of the qualification certification of a judge, initiate his disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
The presidential council considers it necessary to "elect the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "to give them powers for a relatively short term with mandatory rotation".
Now all court presidents (from the republican to the district) are appointed for six years by the president on the recommendation of the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
To protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the Human Rights Council proposes a new way of organizing appeals and cassation in general courts.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Human Rights Council says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts".
The experts are based on the practice of arbitration courts.
They have "judicial districts", which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who find it difficult to use the "telephone right".
The Human Rights Council proposes to strengthen the peace judges by popular panels to consider some "categories of civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, about the loss of parental rights, about the restoration of employment, about the protection of honor and dignity, about the loss of driving license, etc.
"These are only our proposals", explained "Ъ" the member of the SPHR, retired judge of the Constitutional Court Tamara Morshakova.
She also reminded that the president's instructions were not only for the SPHR, but also for the Supreme Court (SV), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time to fulfill the task at the Supreme Court (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Russian human rights commissioner).
The Supreme Court chairman, Vyacheslav Lebedev, must report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of the judiciary is being ensured in Russia by September 1.
Living high: Half-floor and sleek design techniques turned this little apartment in Earls Court into a spacious home
Joan Lee, a former banker who is passionate about real estate, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a nice Queen Anne-style house, and the new design is a testament to the fact that Joan didn't pack up her things and move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge, a much larger area", says Joan.
I was looking for something to match my money.
They showed me this apartment in Earl's Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price the same day.
Since the first time I saw it, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely remodeled.
Originally, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout  to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen  and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a second floor to maximize the benefits of the generous ceiling height.
I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
"These were my demands", she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to use the 12.5 foot ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be suitable for Joan to live in.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where one could stand at full height.
Erfan had to be creative to handle the briefing.
"It's very difficult to work with steel", he explains.
We had to arrange the rooms so that they were on top of each other and not have to bend.
It was not just a simple platform, but a curve to make it at the right height to allow for the use of the space above and below.
This solution allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one on top of the other in the space allocated  and much more interesting.
From the half-floor through the vintage copper light window from Retrouvius, you can see the lavish living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold trim, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Muy define the style of the project.
Mirrors play a role in adding spectacle, space, and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror panel looks like a window to another room.
The mirror cabinets at the entrance are for keeping all of Joan's dishes.
To create a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can enclose the kitchen when not in use.
There's nothing new about folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a sliding door that goes up like a garage door.
"This was an engineering feat", Erfan says of the steel-reinforced wood-fiber shield door.
It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.
By using space and storage wisely, Joan gained an additional 50 square feet [16 sq m], an additional bedroom, and improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is exactly what you're going to sell, which is how your property is valued", Erfan says.
Basically, a real estate agent will come in and calculate the floor area.
Here, they were able to increase the floor area using high-quality materials that give the space a luxurious feel.
 Materials  are what we touch, so they help to create an emotional connection to the home, says Erfan.
Nobody falls in love with wiring in a wall.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts.
This is proof that with good design and increased footprint, a condo can go from something ordinary to something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you may decide to stay.
The government approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decree is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to implementing cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop a draft strategy for cultural policy, specify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the commission is appointed by the deputy chairman of the Russian government.
The commission will be approved separately.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation in 2016 approved the implementation plan of the State Cultural Policy Strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries down to eight-year low
Consumer prices in the G20 countries have fallen to their lowest levels in eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% - lower values were noted in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, the Russian State Statistical Office reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
The department thus recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economics, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the ecological development of the natural territory of Baikal warned against illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskaya noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It allows for logging during firefighting, and the government plans to adopt it as early as this fall.
In turn, the president said that the project should be monitored to ensure that the logging process "does not cut everything down".
Donsky noted that the bill would require oversight by the emergency services and supervisory agencies.
Media: Fighters of the Armed Forces secretly negotiate with Donbass militiamen
There is a regular telephone connection in the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
The combatants on opposite sides are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and the headquarters are unaware of this communication.
The U.S. Army and the Donbas militia have been communicating on cell phones in secret from their high command.
This is reported on August 4 by "Strana.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the newspaper, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
The communication is not at all casual: the commanders are trying to reach some "tactical agreements".
Often, such talks result in a ceasefire on a particular front line.
Journalists have learned of cases where a certain officer received birthday greetings from outside the front line, from his formal enemy.
The Ukrainian Armed Forces and the DPR and LPR militias have been sitting in trenches along the border since Ukraine launched its military operation against Donbass in the spring of 2014.
The Foreign Ministry is outraged by the UN Security Council 's blocking of statements about attacks on the Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomats who are blocking statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The Russian Embassy in Damascus was hit by mortar fire on August 2 for the third time in a month by terrorists from the Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in Russia) and Faylak Ar-Rahman groups.
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in qualifying "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for countering this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem to be self-evident that the attacks of "Nusra" should meet universal unconditional and resolute condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the evaluations of the attacks against diplomatic representations".
However, as the diplomatic service stressed, "for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately varying the tone of objections, using the arguments of alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement of the Security Council for the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital".
The refusal to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of these delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the actions of terrorists encourages them to further provocations and attacks, gives them a sense of impunity", the Foreign Ministry said, adding that it "would not want these barbarians to believe that someone in the Security Council is with them".
Vladimir Putin has called for limiting unplanned business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of unplanned inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said that the inspection period should be limited to ten days.
"Extra-planned inspections are usually carried out without the proper coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% are coordinated with the prosecutor's office, the rest go independently", - quotes the president TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should be given the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"I hope this will bring a certain positive impact on the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or violations of the law in the field of entrepreneurship", the head of state said.
As the "Kommersant" reported, due to the moratorium on planned inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, a survey was conducted by the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, which revealed that in fact, there was a replacement of planned inspections by unplanned ones (the share of those faced with them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial ones (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as inspections on citizens' applications (growth from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).

Brothers fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
Two brothers fight for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin de Lutyens lives in the Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a property and assets division lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court.
Paul has been trying to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in the middle of a heated dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, purchased since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew to a network of 160 stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's list of holdings today includes office buildings, development lots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, that means Colin's assets are $316 million and Paul's are $176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The division Colin proposed gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property", he wrote in his first deposition in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed reconciliation attempts, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now fighting over who will control the existing business - from which Paul believes Colin has removed him.
Colin claims that's not true, but he accuses Paul of mismanaging some of the facilities.
In Colin's testimony at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes the dispute will be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority", he wrote.
The legal costs are snowballing, with hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and both sides have drawn the best lawyers, including Crown Counsel Alan Myers, and the best cookers.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and gastronomes, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
With financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last year of high school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he did not want the brothers to go to court", she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colina says Mark received $10 million when he went out of business and Luke $26 million.
Paul says that both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with their financial situation".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL board of directors and, according to a biography published in 2015, Eddie McGirr, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, texting, saying that since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really don't have much to say".
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to tarnish our family name in court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his statement that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not want to see Paul and I argue in court", he said, adding that he "still hopes for a resolution of the conflict".
By Friday, that hope had apparently dissipated.
"The court will soon rule on our case", wrote Colin.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit information to the president.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will actually do it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in hopes of keeping the chief more calm.
This is from reporter Josh Doosey.
"In a meeting that the new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly held with White House officials on his first day in office, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the president".
Kelly told his staff that information should come through him - on paper or through briefings - because the president would be better at making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed to appease Trump by tracking his information.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV habit is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by unfair campaign coverage, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded", Sam Nanberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico that "six former campaign staffers said that to keep Trump's Twitter habits in check, we needed to ensure that the personal information he received was a constant stream of praise".
I'll be right there.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits were ever "under control" is just ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign staffers know something we don't, like that, if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his associates have saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one could always stop Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trump with material - credible or not - that supports their views.
Politico, which was about this story, reported in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly feed the president questionable information.
Here's an example, reported by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former aides say Trump can react very harshly to negative media reports, especially dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who is behind them.
This happened in late February when someone handed the president a printed article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Kathy Welsh was accused of being "behind a series of leaks" at the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson was banned from Twitter forever for aggressive behavior, that he didn't present concrete facts, or that he made false accusations in the past and then denied them.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Welsh".
Goldmacher adds that then-chief of staff Raines Priebus and secretary of the Treasury Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them".
How'd that work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor 's office is fighting HIV-dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Kalinin district court of Tyumen to dismiss the criminal case against a local woman whose young daughter died of HIV.
The investigation claims that the child died because the mother was an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court acquitted her of the charges because she had reconciled with her father.
The prosecution believes that the crime cannot go unpunished, lest it set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the Tyumen resident was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (cause of death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection in the 4B stage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV positive.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist", - explained in the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region.
The criminal case was submitted to the Kalininsky district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that he "forgave his wife, has no complaints against her, she has compensated for the damage and apologized".
The prosecutor's office did not agree with the court's decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to dismiss the case be reversed and sent for a new hearing.
The girl is dead, and the damage done by the crime is irreparable.
The mother, who is HIV-positive, has refused to examine her baby and treat her for a dangerous infection, despite the advice of doctors", the prosecutor's office said.
The watchdog says she should be punished or other HIV dissidents will follow.
According to the AIDS Center in Tyumen, about 12 HIV-positive children in the Tyumen region are currently not receiving medical care because of their parents' refusal.
"The situation has improved - within a year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who had refused to treat their children for HIV changed their minds - they were allowed to be diagnosed and started taking medication", said Elena Loseva, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
She said it is impossible to legislate on parents, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children are detected - mothers are not allowed to examine them, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents ?
Late last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and AIDS-serving NGOs call such views anti-medical and see their spread as a serious threat.
The horrific photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grečani railway station in Khmelnytsk.
A merry company of drunken young men were walking along a bridge over the railroad tracks, right where a freight train was parked.
One of his friends had the idea to take an impressive selfie on the roof of a car, the police communication department in the Khmelnytsk region told FAKTAM.
The boy started to get off the bridge and onto the train, but due to his carelessness he grabbed the power line and was instantly electrocuted.
Fortunately, the station dispatcher was notified of the incident and immediately called an emergency.
Before the doctors arrived, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn unit of the Khmelnytsky regional clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with a 1-2 degree burn to the torso.
His condition is now considered stable.
Law enforcement officials say extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, and moving vehicles are becoming increasingly popular.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have suggested the existence of oceans on ancient Venus .
Ancient Venus may have had oceans.
This is what French scientists have suggested.
Scientists have created a computer model that shows how water forms on the surface of planets, reports Science News.
It turns out that Venus had oceans early in its history, and they had 10% more water than we have on Earth today.
Earlier, "Arguments of the Week" reported that scientists hypothesized that an ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a shooting in a San Francisco park.
Three people have been injured in a shooting in San Francisco, the Associated Press reports.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park when there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them pulled out a gun and started shooting at people.
The attackers' appearance was not readily apparent, as they were covered except for their eyes.
Another was treated and released.
The third victim is a minor, no details on his condition.
Dolores Park is a popular hilltop destination for locals and tourists alike.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured while trying to leave the premises.
The rock band Louna will be presenting their new album in Barnaul .
The concert of the rock band Louna will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The band is preparing a concept show that will be the most spectacular in the band's concert history.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is a reference to O. Huxley's novel-anti-utopia "A Wonderful New World".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell of a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, "blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values".
The group was helped to raise money for the album by listeners: on the website "Planeta.ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Louna released her first album "Do Loud!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians released the album "Time X", and in 2013 recorded the album "We - it Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna performed with a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the program "Songs of Peace".
The band is composed of Lucine Gevorkyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), and Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held in the Barnaul club "Faraon" on October 17 at 19.00.
Tickets are $1,200 to $2,600.
Louna is one of the most popular bands in the Russian rock scene.
The band was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "Dirty Dozen".
The gypsies have crossed the moat and returned to the Street of Millionaires.
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are once again in conflict with determined gypsies who have climbed over a municipal ditch to reoccupy a field near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the affluent Solihull Street, jokingly called the "Millionaire Street".
They returned with horses, babies and a host of houses on wheels after being driven out in May, and were not prevented by a ditch dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defensive structures and pushed their vehicles through an area that was left unfenced to make way for a trail.
Angry residents attacked Solihull municipality, saying it was "unable to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident reported: "They arrived here on Monday evening after being driven from Bentley Heath where they were throwing stones at passersby".
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were driven out, and now they're back.
More gypsies came last night, and today, maybe more.
"Birmingham City knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks", she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the city tax, and the city can't even stop it.
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the last time, and now please, this attack continues".
This time, they got bigger, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow.
A municipal spokesman for Solihull said: We are aware of an illegal camp on the land near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them out as soon as possible.
To help us gather evidence, it's important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police on 101.
This gives you an idea of what the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the plant of champagne "New World"
The State Unitary Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea "New World Champagne Wine Plant" has been decided to be acquired by transforming it into the OJSC "New World Champagne Wine Plant", according to the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the state ownership of Crimea.
The share capital of the joint stock company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each .
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if within the next three years funds were not found to modernize the enterprise, the plant would be threatened with closure.
The wear and tear of the main assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The company needs to modernize 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget income.
What's left is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It is problematic to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations", - said the Deputy Head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea Sergey Petelin in April this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the enterprise in the forecast plan for privatization in 2017 .
It was proposed to stockpile it and put it up for auction.
The "Interfax" source in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $30 million.
"New World" in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to 2015 level - to 1,52 million bottles.
In 2017, "New Light" was going to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Leo Golitsyn as a sparkling wine production plant in the New World estate he had acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Ninhgorod third-graders destroyed more than 40 gravestones
The staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region identified the citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of Lyskovo.
The perpetrators were third graders.
The first statement that the grave slabs were damaged by unknown persons was received by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In all, 24 people have contacted the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places".
Police have identified the suspects as two schoolchildren, ages 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told police that they were interested in seeing the falling of monuments, which prompted them to act as hooligans.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone on NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue operating unless they comply with new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities", Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
The warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been in operation for just over a year, declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving lives is and will remain our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our search and rescue activities now", the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations now, "after we have gathered all the information and we can assess the situation".
Italian authorities have been tracking the Juventus vessel, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking migrants on board in whole lifeboats, which were sent directly to them by human traffickers, and allowing the smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the indictment, which was published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the directives of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, out of humanitarian zeal rather than any other motive.
The code of conduct essentially stipulates that ships like the Juve will have an Italian police officer on board to supervise their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Extended Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they did not cause any "significant changes or interference" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coastguard and cooperate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He announced plans to hold further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any side in the conflict"
The Russian authorities have recently intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and delegations from opposing Libyan sides have visited Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, the assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told "Ъ", what goals Moscow pursues in this region and who it is betting on.
We know almost nothing about the Libya contact group you're leading.
Let's say the Ukraine contact group -- everybody knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was created at the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya - "Ъ").
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan direction by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The group was formed after the detention of the Russian tanker "Mekanik Chebotaarev" in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Ъ").
We've been thinking about how we can help the crew.
Then a contact group of military experts, representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you come to be the one in charge?
Since I've been working on Libya since 2008, I've been asked to lead the team.
Our activities were not limited to the release of the sailors from the "Mechanic Chebotarev".
We have managed to establish contacts with all the main groups opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognised government headed by Faiz Sarraj is based. - "Ъ") and Tobruk (the seat of the parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya - "Ъ").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Libya's deputy prime minister - "Ъ"), we managed to quickly agree on the release of the Russian sailors.
And so it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Her job is to analyze the situation, identify key players and factors, and engage with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any side in the conflict, we are in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are five people in the contact group now.
Among them are people with experience in law enforcement, including the Defense Ministry.
We also want to bring in a group of experts from the region, representatives of the Middle East Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
There's no permanent staff in Libya, so there's no need for that.
Are there any Russian military advisors, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, whose side are you on?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and all the publicity about it is not true.
But your contact group includes ex-military personnel...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we visit hot spots.
Or cities that have been closed to us for a while, like Misurata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and have been significantly activated in the years since).
We came to Misrata in January of this year.
We were scared, told that it was all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why these rumors are going around, what the role of the Islamists really is.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the teams that were involved in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the banned Islamic State - Kommersant).
We wanted to look at them, get to know these people, verify the information that they were the ones who played a crucial role in taking out ISIS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who claimed credit for it.
And what did you conclude?
Is it Haftar who won the Islamic State in Libya?
He didn't do it.
Haftar was conducting operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirte was fought by the government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we invited the people who were conducting this counterterrorism operation to Russia.
And they came - the visit lasted from April 19 to 23 this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and the Rosgvardi.
We understand that you've been to all the regions of Libya and you probably know the mood of the local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire and elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Sarraj reached in Paris at the end of July will be implemented?
Or will agreements be broken, fighting resume, and the parties try to take power alone?
It's a good sign for us that Saraj and Haftar have agreed to meet again, which was not possible until recently.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe this.
We encountered this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar was boarding the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that very day.
It was a coincidence.
But the Misurans didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people to come to us today".
But our task is precisely to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we are engaging with all key actors in the Libyan conflict.
You and Haftar were in touch.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR make it easier for him to understand his Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
Russian, if he knows it, is very relative.
But what he's learned from us, of course, makes it easier to talk to him.
And not just him, by the way.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who were either trained in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian perfectly.
And they're reaching for Russia, feeling a little nostalgic for it.
Do you think the arms embargo on Libya is likely to be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in Russian arms supplies?
They are, of course, but as I said, we are not taking sides in this conflict and we do not want to arm one to the detriment of the other.
We'd like to see everyone in a more or less equal position.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from Libyans for Russia to help lift it.
The process of drafting a constitution is now in full swing in Libya.
We hope the parties will reach a compromise, an internal consensus.
Then there should be elections, as was discussed at the meeting between Sarraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and a legitimate government is finally elected (and now neither side has such a status), then the issue of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the UN Security Council.
It is pointless and dangerous to raise this issue now, it will only escalate the conflict.
The media recently reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned by its EU allies.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its ties to the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the possibility that Haftar's forces will take control of the coast and end the smuggling business that smuggles immigrants to Europe?
That's a very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with Haftar, Sarajevo, Misrata and the south of the country.
And the tribes in southern Libya have a big role to play in this, and they're willing to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the southerners cutting off the flow of migrants at the far reaches?
So, technically, they turned back the buses carrying Nigerian migrants?
We're working on it.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help bring the southerners together in a negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes to the south.
But first, we'd like to see some consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
Tripoli's prime minister, Faiz Sarraj, is considered an Islamist and supporter of the introduction of sharia law.
How radical is he?
Would this not be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give you my personal opinion.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself maintains that Libya should be a perfectly normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get that reputation?
It's created by countries that have no interest in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, the seat of the legislative, executive and judicial branches.
There's the national oil corporation, the national bank and other government agencies.
Of course, some countries had an interest in keeping us out.
And we've been playing cards with them and we've been actively communicating with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has signed a cooperation agreement with the Libyan state oil company NOC.
NOC director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft chief Igor Sechin was making a deal, is himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with her?
I guess I'll resell.
What other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
The agreement is based on the previous agreements in the transport sector (building of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have money to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, like Iran, is this an oil-for-services scheme?
I don't know what the pattern is, but I'm not really into that stuff.
Actually, the economy is not the most important thing for Russia in Libya.
We're basically doing peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to reconcile among themselves so that they can establish order in their own country and Libya ceases to be a fertile environment for terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and drive the terrorists out.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date, there are no people from Russia or other countries of the former USSR there.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamist and radical groups in Libya and no Russian was spoken.
What country are these fighters from?
I'd rather not go into that detail.
Well, let's put it another way.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans?
There are hardly any Libyans among them, no more than 5%.
The rest are visitors.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan negotiations like Paris?
That's the plan.
We are in active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have expressed their readiness to come again - to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such a negotiation take place?
It's hard to say now.
There are still a few visits to be made, and then I hope we can get some clarity on when and where the talks will take place.
In the Chekhov Museum , donors raised money for a gift to a sick boy
In the Moscow-area's Melikhov Museum-Reserve, a nine-year-old boy named Sasha Mazola, who has cerebral palsy, brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a special running track as a gift on August 5.
The gift will be presented by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the gym was raised during the charity marathon "Don't get tired of doing good", which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on the day of the memory of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkin in the Chekhov district: "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter".
"I would love to get a treadmill as a gift so that my legs would be strong and I could learn to walk a little bit".
And now Sasha's dream has come true!
After the presentation, the "Concert-post-scriptum" will take place in the museum-reserve - the famous pianist, the honored artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform poppers from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the Choir of the David Desert, the bell ringers of the workshop of Ilya Droздиhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Chaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnezin, artists of the Melikhov Theatre "Czehovskaya Studio" performed.
For visitors, auctions were held, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with the marathon logo were organized.
The Melikhov Museum-Reserve has taken the initiative to make the day of memory of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all museums in the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk in the Zhytomyr region fired several shots at teenagers near a local football stadium.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, the communication department of the Zhytomyr region police told FAKTAM.
After that, the man went into a nearby cafe.
A man used a rubber bullet firing device to injure one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim has been given medical attention and is not in danger of death.
Police and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by then.
Law enforcement identified him and detained him on August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's been stripped of a rubber bullet firing device, sent for an autopsy.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The suspect faces a sentence of three to seven years in prison.
We will remind, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya street in the night of July 28 there was an attack with a gunshot.
Michelle Carter sentenced for the messages that led to Conrad Roy's suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was allowed to remain at large pending appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, her arms folded and her eyes down.
"She killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She has not admitted responsibility", she said.
"She showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic incident that she deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that in his opinion, her "age, maturity, or even mental illness did not significantly influence her actions".
The prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, which said: "Not a day has passed that I have not mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm doing - I'm trying to support his sisters despite all the pain that will stay with us forever".
Roy's sister Camden Roy said she was haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or be his children's aunt.
"Losing the person who was always with me from the day I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life", she said.
This case is likely to set a legal precedent, since Massachusetts has no law that would hold a person liable for counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in his car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17.
The case drew national attention when it was revealed that Carter's suicide note had been the impetus.
"You can hang yourself, jump off a roof, stab yourself, I don't know how many ways there are", she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
Minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You must do this, Conrad", and "You only have to turn on the ignition, and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and he banned her from talking to the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
Lawyers are divided on the matter.
One of the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times that "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison".
Eugene Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a bird in high flight"
One of the best basketball players in the VTB United League, 33-year-old Keith Langford has left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender was commented by the president of UNIX, Yevgeny Bogachev.
Kit made this decision due to family circumstances, - said Eugene Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go to him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different treatment.
He played three seasons in the UNIX and in every game he showed a high level, he gave 100%.
So I let him go like a bird in high flight.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning the 2015/16 United League silver.
In the 2016-17 season, he received the award for the most outstanding player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This is the second such award since it was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with the Chinese Shenzhen, Eurohoops reports.
The American is expected to sign a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star in July to move to the Chinese championship.
Previously, ex-central of Panathinaikos Yanis Burusis moved to the Chinese CBA.
Sunburned tourist evacuated in Adygea
Adyghe rescuers have evacuated a tourist from the mountainous region of the republic who was severely sunburned.
The man was resting in the "Fisht" shelter, located at an altitude of 1,6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had elevated blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
The initial diagnosis is a severe allergic reaction.
The head of the tour group told the rescuers that the man had suffered burns during the hike.
Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
A day before the announcement, Audi and BMW said they would offer software updates to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW stated that the company believes there are smarter ways than driving restrictions, referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called it a recall.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help enforce carbon dioxide regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers of installing equipment to neutralize diesel exhaust is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of giving in to powerful automakers and ignoring signs of trouble.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called "defeat devices", which during testing could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to meet the regulations, and in normal driving conditions were turned off.
In the United States, several Volkswagen executives have been indicted, and the others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department at the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccchio Giovanni Pammi, is Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation could pose serious problems for Volkswagen: the luxury car maker is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's revenue.
A cafe visitor paid with fake money
The police received a message from a bank employee about the detection of a suspicious 5 thousand rubles note when counting the money received from the food bank.
A study conducted by the Criminal Investigation Center found that it was a fake.
According to the Russian Interior Ministry in the Astrahan region, the banknote was paid by one of the cafe visitors who bought a shaurma.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the bills.
Currently, the police are investigating the persons involved in the production and sale of a deliberately fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrahan region to be careful when making financial transactions; employees of trade facilities are recommended to install instruments to check the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a planet that's a hell, and it's even capable of melting iron
When they first studied the stratosphere properties of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is capable of evaporating iron and other metals.
The researchers noted that water molecules are heated by the starlight to such an extent that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Space Telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: the high temperature that causes the water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared.
WASP-121b belongs to the so-called "hot Jupiters", gas giants that are comparable in size and mass to the largest planet in the Solar System but are located dozens of times closer to their parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "Earth" days", and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is threatening the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now fears are being raised that it is threatened by climate change.
The drought and disease-carrying insects have made the lavender's growth worse, causing a constant headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Schess, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, says: "The lavender in Provence is really under threat because in recent years the plant has been suffering from the effects of climate change, with much less rainfall in the spring and especially in the fall.
It affects the life of the lavender.
And there are little cycads that jump on leaves, carrying microorganisms, and they get very big in very dry weather".
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender is not only a tourist attraction; lavender oil is also a popular perfume and cosmetic product.
Says Eric Sess: "Instead of very long stems with many large flowers, we have small ones, underdeveloped, weakened or none at all.
So we have fewer parts that contain essential oil".
Solutions now being considered include improving water distribution and slowing soil evaporation, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more drought-resistant varieties.
Winter Universiade Ambassador meets with schoolchildren from Krasnoyarsk
Two-time world champion in hockey, ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019, Alexander Semin met with the newcomers and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting took place in the Winter Universiade 2019 tent as part of the thematic week dedicated to hockey with the puck.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on the artificial ice rink.
In addition, there were organized relay races, quizzes and games with souvenir products of student games, warm-up from the aerobics federation.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semyn advised the children to exercise as much as possible on the sports pitches and stressed that the most important thing in the initial stage of training is hard work and a great desire to play hockey.
"It's great that in Krasnoyarsk there is a platform like the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019, where beginner athletes can ask questions directly to the coaches of the teams", - said the champion.
The ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 are helping to promote student sport and a healthy lifestyle among the red-haired people.
The tent will be in place throughout the summer season until September 25, the Winter Universiade 2019 Directorate's press service reports.
State Department commented on Medvedev 's comments
US State Department official Heather Nauert, commenting on the statement of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said that it was necessary to find "areas for cooperation" with Russia.
She said such areas should be found to "improve bilateral cooperation".
Nauert cited the ceasefire agreement in Syria as an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work together", the diplomat said.
Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev's assertion of a full-scale trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, it certainly has the right to say it, but I can't say anything else", the State Department official said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Washington had declared a full-fledged trade war with Moscow, ending hopes of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that U.S. sanctions would last for decades.
In addition, the prime minister believes that the American establishment "clearly beat" Trump.
A bodybuilder who went missing in Moscow was found in a country house by people with memory loss
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov went missing on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he came out of the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, his friends and neighbors searched for him, but without success.
And Shamil was found on someone else's dacha in Ramensky.
He was found naked in his own bathroom.
The Dagestani athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
The missing persons report helped establish his identity.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded that Khanmetov had partial memory loss and a skull-brain injury, the Mash news site reports.
There are probably other surprises for the athletes.
The intruders who kidnapped Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys from which were also stolen.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
The actual oil and gas revenues received in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reports.
The increase, the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the fact that the actual volume of gas production and the volume of oil products exports exceeded the forecasted levels.
"The deviation of the federal budget's oil and gas revenues from the monthly assessment, in accordance with the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected to be +40,2 billion rubles", - said in the message of the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated to the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017, is 47,6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Russian Finance Ministry.
Each working day during the specified period the Central Bank will conclude foreign currency purchase transactions at the organized trades of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the Federal Treasury's accounts at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist highlights that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodosse usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa state, including organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing drug war.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they needed to change their habits.
Two senior journalists were discussing what seemed safer: taking the children to an office that was already bombed in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked the journalists to name names for each column -- no proof needed, suspicion and gut feeling would suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a whole list of villains that make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
The violence is raging, and among the bodies that are growing in the country are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven people have been killed in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, "RioDose" co-founder Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", Valdés wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdés, pointing his middle finger, with the words "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodos building; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that show his smile, face in glasses or his signature Panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; the journalists discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to investigate journalists, so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed each year in connection with drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
The journalists of Riodos insist on reporting on the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are killed by grief, even though it is much more dangerous now.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the security talks at the meetings are of little use", says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste time in this workshop", he says.
"Until we know the cause, we suspect everyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodos office in Culiacan, the state capital.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's title - which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdés was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors usually spread quickly around Culiacan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the US last January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions battle to fill the vacuum.
Not to mention the fact that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate two-story mausoleums of drug lords that are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that a state of calm is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdés was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorquez, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, is overwhelmed with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel that is fighting the Guzman Sons.
The publication could have angered the sons; people who were supposedly gang members bought all the copies as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn't force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that was covering the same story was seized.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He'd been out of danger so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd be forever.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003 he and five colleagues founded Riodos, selling his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without talking about drugs", said Bohorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for being bold and honest, and sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists loved the fact that they could report bold stories without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that they could read about things that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodosse received the prestigious Maria Murs Cabo Award for its reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it led.
He frankly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to move on", he said at the CPJ award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life", he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You must accept the tasks that are placed upon you as a journalist, either that or you are just being a fool".
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodos staff misses Valdés, a joker who was a hardened porter, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on the order they had established.
He had to wear his hat at all times.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from his office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask, was he destroyed by his love of the once established order?
His death also made them question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you to know about their wives, their children, their legitimate businesses and their underground drug airfields.
"These things were over the line", said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and a drive for self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says Riodos editor Andres Villarreal, is that "the smell can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier happens".
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
The room where Riodos staff were gathered for security training was suddenly forbidden to bring cell phones: days before, it was revealed that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, is being used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside , two policemen are hiding in the shade of a tree from the 104 degree heat .
They were assigned by the state government to guard the Riodos office, which is in a four-story building in the middle of the Kulikakan neighborhood.
Some reporters half-jokingly asked if these policemen were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials the governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the next issue, "Ryodos" was expected to have three main themes.
It's the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio César Chávez.
They also had a government expenditure exposure centered in the governor's hometown.
And there was a gang kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from public databases that the restaurant was registered to a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for most of the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been the subject of high-profile corruption charges.
Villarreal asked reporters to cover previous incidents at the restaurant, including the time when Guzman's "El Chapo" son escaped a military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have looked for Valdes' column with the most reliable information about a kidnapping.
"We would have known what happened before", says Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"All communication with our sources is cut today".
Valdes' office is now used as a storage facility for posters and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, because the staff have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took some posters and went to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office the next morning to honor another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
They found a burnt body, and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists have been speaking out, organizing protests and writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls.
Director Bohorquez was in Washington that day, trying to rally international support to demand justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with Sinaloa's governor the day after Valdés's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their deaths for telling the truth.
She then asked not to be given any more government coverage, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by drug gangs; they are killed by politicians and security services who are in league with organized crime.
The Article 19 Press Protection Committee estimates that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up", Ramirez says.
Of course, murders scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, supposedly written by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my articles".
A computer keyboard and headphones were found next to her severed head.
Some newspapers chose to close down, like El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslava Brech was murdered in March.
Others continue to hold on, like El Manjana of Nuevo Laredo after its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still find danger on the streets.
And sometimes they get killed, as apparently happened with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four other women in a Mexican apartment three months after he fled Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work are balancing risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he is afraid to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist", he says.
Last Friday at midnight, when the last issue was ready for print, the editors of the Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk near their office drinking beer when their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan have left 19 dead, according to confirmed reports.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news on the website Riodosse via mobile phone.
The next day, I had to rewrite the front page.
Sirens have gone off nearby, another shooting in the area.
Bochorkes checked to see if the police guarding them were ready to defend themselves.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to view throughout Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued his work.
"How can you think of shutting down", said Bohorquez, "when the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her outside to do a story?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it appears to be a statue, though it is terrifying.
Researchers say the first remains of an incredible rhinos-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts have dubbed it the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even identify that the color of its scaly skin was reddish-brown and say that it had, in a way, a dark past.
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as "the best preserved of the Tireophores in all the history of finds and one of the best specimens of dinosaurs in the world".
This is a recently discovered fossil of a nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible condition has stunned researchers who call it "really remarkable".
This herbivorous tireophor is the best preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the discovery, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
It was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Sancor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tirrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years , work was underway to find an animal weighing 2,500 feet (1100 kilograms) inside the earthenware.
Now that all that hard work is done, the finished product can be demonstrated.
"Just a little squint and you can almost believe it's asleep", said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, where the creature is on display.
It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved specimens of dinosaurs.
By examining its skin, researchers found that this herbivore, although it was covered in a shell and resembled a walking tank, was apparently in significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful-armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a protective technique known as protective dye, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow it to blend in more quickly and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurus family was widely reported in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of Mark Mitchell, a museum lab technician who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly excavating it.
The remarkable preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and shell plates on its body.
They found protective dye, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the protective dye is widespread, the discovery was a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the size of any animal currently living with the protective dye.
It's possible that this dinosaur was so heavily hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective coloration - such as deer, zebras, or armored vehicles - are much smaller and more accessible prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to fight hard for survival.
"The serious threat from predators to the massive, powerful-shell dinosaur shows just how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous Period were", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur's scales also suggests that its skin must have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for clues to its life, including what remains of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They think that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was washed out to sea, where it sank and lay on its back on the ocean floor.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida is now, and rivers and oceans likely extended farther inland than they do now.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original animal form", Brown said.
The result is that the animal now looks almost exactly as it did back then, in the Early Cretaceous.
It doesn't take much imagination to recreate it, just a little nudging, and you can almost believe it's asleep.
The Cretaceous is the time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of these, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, the thyreophorus may have been hunted by one of its formidable ancestors.
Among them is the acrocanthosaurus, a monster that measures 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighs six tons.
Scientists whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was carried to the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved thyreophore in the world, along with the skin and armor, and it is intact, from the muzzle to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spines protruding from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous thyreophore trampled heavily on what is now Canada until a flooded river washed it out to sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its shell to the last detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bulging shell plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic, such a degree of preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery".
The longer I look at it, the more amazing it seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bulging shell plates that dot the animal's skull.
His right front leg is extended along the side, five fingers on it facing up.
I can count the scales on his sole.
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously led Georgia and then Ukraine's Odessa region, has flown to Poland.
He did so without having any documents to prove his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili's arrival was reported by the Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his speech on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to mark the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not speak Polish, although he tried to speak in that language, he had to speak in English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The disgruntled politician learned that the Ukrainian immigration service had stripped him of his citizenship while he was in the United States.
How he managed to fly across the Atlantic without papers is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of Odessa region Mikheil Saakashvili said that his signature on the application for Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician insisted he didn't fill out any forms.
The investigation into the Weinziher and Olkhovik case has been extended to January .
The term of the preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the Renova Group of companies, Yevgeny Olkhovik, and the head of the T Plus energy holding, Boris Weinziher, has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman County Court will hear a case to extend the defendants' house arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting announced the decision to extend the term of the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to take and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigative actions in several Russian subjects", - said the investigator.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed Comey's management.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of the ZAO "Complex energy systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vympelkom", handed over bribes to the top officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olchowicz were detained, taken to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from investigation and was declared a federal wanted.
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to her core.
Just one day after arriving in New York City on a tourist trip, the St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an Airbnb apartment, looking at Facebook on her phone.
She ran into a post from high school.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still lying in the middle of the street".
Noticing that no one else from her feed had posted this information, she was puzzled and closed her Facebook and opened Twitter.
Her video featured a lot of user posts with the nickname @TheePharoah.
A rapper from the Greater St. Louis area tweeted live about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street for four hours.
"This is wild", Ferrell thought.
But death was not new to her and her circle.
She hung up and later that night, she went back to tweeting about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signal tape and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that said, "Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, pulled the trigger and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals!"
"This is an unusual situation", Ferrell recalled.
This is not a murder like the ones we're used to, which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and I cried.
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, due out on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in the community and filling the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a colorful wreath, they recalled a conversation they had had that morning, countless times, about the experience of black people and their condition.
She remembers saying, "Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong.
"I couldn't help but take it", Ferrell said later.
What's happening today is the culmination of what's happened before.
She needs to know it, see it, and grow up with it.
She needs to be not only well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their situation and what we need to do to become free, to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment where she herself will not face overt racism, she is no different than any other black girl.
I feel like I'd be doing her a disservice if I kept her out of it.
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, a site across the street from the police station that had become something of a tent camp while activists waited for word of the ultimate acquittal of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local businessman who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected the bags and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, a new kind of activism took shape in Ferrell's mind.
"My activism changed completely after August 9", she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the National Minority Health Students Association and worked for food equity and health inequality in black communities.
I had no experience as an organizer.
It came by itself.
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Saba'a Folayyan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her chief cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Ferrare "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell had this question in his head: "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This skepticism was fueled by the many people, often white, who came to the community to take advantage of his pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson were not being heard, and we wanted to do something different".
By that time, Foley had teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His participation sparked sympathy for the project among Ferrell and six other local residents, with whom the Whose Streets? project team maintained contact for years after Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves", Davis said.
It was the most important thing for me to be represented by these people, because that's how I'm going to be represented.
And while the project was not intended to focus on Ferrell's experience at all, in an effort to show that the movement is not about a leader-savior, but about how a community comes together, Folayan said she was the most open-minded of the film's participants.
The resulting Whose Streets? shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married her husband.
"I felt naked", said Ferrell, laughing as she recalled seeing the finished product for the first time.
But I knew that when you do this kind of work and you humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.
Furthermore, Ferrell's story again discusses and emphasizes the role of the black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created the #BlackLivesMatter social media hashtag after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin - identify as gay.
"Black, lesbian women in leadership positions are supporting this whole movement", says Ferrell. "It's because we're fighting on multiple fronts all the time.
Black gay women have to carry all this burden.
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that the movement is actually supported by black women and many homosexual black women.
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of her distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened that energy", she said.
On the other hand, it's no coincidence that she's in the foreground, because when
You can feel the energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long since been without movie cameras, but there remain complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell's on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place she calls home, simply: Bardak.
She's still holding on to the language she learned when she walked down the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We should love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
Two El Salvador players disqualified for biting a U.S. player
Salvador national team players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren have been suspended for a long time for unsportsmanlike conduct.
During the quarterfinal match of the Gold Cup of the Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), the Salvadorans bit the American players.
The first to stand out was defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit the striker Jose Altidore and then pinched his chest.
Then midfielder Serén, while serving a corner, bit US defender Omar Gonzalez in his penalty area.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Serena - for six.
The match ended with the Americans winning 2:0, Goal.com reports.
The emergence of a similarity: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning 's DNA
In the center of the room at the Friedman Gallery in New York, people's faces hanging from the ceiling on the wire -- white, black and brown, all looking somewhat similar.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from Fort Leavenworth, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the infamous WikiLeaks leak of classified diplomatic cables.
The new exhibition, which opens August 2, is called "The Emergence of Similarity".
It's the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and prominent dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama just three days before his presidency ended.
By analyzing the DNA program Manning had provided and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who might have had this genome, Dewey-Harborg created a profound, though hard-to-understand, manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data - the different ways it is interpreted and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but openly identified as a woman since her teens, was convicted in 2013 of 20 counts, including six counts of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie of Manning in a platinum wig, clearly feeling awkward behind the wheel of a car, which became associated with her.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project "Visions of Strangers".
In it, she created portraits of unknown people using evidence from court cases, such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the rubbish and creating images of what those people might look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some kind of portrait to illustrate the article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of the new exhibition for the press.
Chelsea was not allowed to visit and take pictures at the time, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to have a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book called Repressed Images, illustrated by Sholi Kanungo, which depicted how in the future the president would ease Chelsea's sentence and she would be able to visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama actually decided to release Manning just days after the book was published was a pleasant surprise after seven years of hard labor in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something profound and powerful about this exhibition opening at a time when Donald Trump is declaring war on people who leak government secrets and inventing new ways to fuel the enmity he's supposed to be softening on Twitter.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said that "nothing happens by chance".
In a statement by the artist, written on the gallery wall, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of the dot above the "i" in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic segregation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the other side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long cluster of C, G and A pencil prints.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist so scientifically expresses it), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how amazingly similar we all are, at least in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not define who we are, how open the genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is", said Dewey-Harborg, whose 2007 video work, False Memories, is also on display here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here".
The last part of the exhibition, which was in one room, is the comic book novel mentioned above.
It shows Manning in a King Kong style, standing over the U.S. Correctional Building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they win", it says.
"So never shut up".
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote me", says the artist who greets us from Philadelphia.
"I still get the chills when I talk about it".
Manning has yet to see the exhibition in person - as the comics so presciently portrayed - but when she arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacrums, gathered like a crowd of protesters.
This was done on purpose, as was everything in the exhibit, right down to the height of the pencil that had the genetic haplogroups drawn on.
"I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd", says Dewey-Harborg of the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation".
A professor at Northwestern University and a staff member at Oxford University are wanted by police on suspicion of murder .
Police say a nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are wanted as suspects in the stabbing death of a man found in a Chicago penthouse.
According to court records, on Monday, warrants were issued for the arrest of 42-year-old Windham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren for unlawful premeditated murder in connection with the alleged death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranello.
According to the records, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after suffering multiple stab wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with multiple stab wounds.
Officials say Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are now investigating the death from stab wounds as a homicide, while police are intensifying their search for two suspects.
Latham has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, the university's vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was barred from the Northwestern campus.
"This is a criminal case that is being investigated by the authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation", Kabbage said.
Warren is a senior fellow in the financial services department at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with the UK police and are ready to provide any assistance necessary to the US investigating authorities".
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department Communications Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advises suspects to turn themselves in.
"The police have a hunch about their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are intensifying", Gulyelmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were called by the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
The police described the crime scene as horrible.
Ghulamy said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He said the security camera data confirms that Latham and Warren were inside the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship", Gulyelmi said.
The Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents saying: "Police are currently working on a chronology of the incident, gathering information about the victim and looking into a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in the fulfilment of the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has received the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK anti-doping agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated accordingly", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap on Restoring Code Compliance, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA's work and was recently published on the website of this organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future", he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly acknowledge the results of a WADA-commissioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sport was controlled by the state.
On this matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit what was not".
Mutko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian newspaper Rsport on the morning of the same day, Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously occurred in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report without any conditions", Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from conducting doping control in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggle said that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to resume its work.
Fire in 79-story tower in Dubai extinguished
A massive fire that broke out in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to extinguish all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 Moscow time).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
The streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed during the fire.
The cause of the accident is still unknown.
Earlier it was reported that the 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is on fire in Dubai.
All the residents were evacuated in time.
Buzova's unimaginable outfit shocked fans: pants that don't cover her underwear
The scandalous host of the reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova has surprised the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with her dance in her underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, the new singer performed the song "We'll be hot" in a duet with Nastya Kudry.
Both girls came out on stage in provocative "pants" sewn so that the singers' underwear was visible.
The pants were made with the inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported that the changes in the appearance of Buzova commented on a specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia is the responsibility of the Russian authorities.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation in Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine".
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the US and Russia were at a dangerously low level, and blamed the US Congress for it.
Ekaterinburg Metro is developing a new payment method
In October, travel in the Ekaterinburg metro can be paid with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, the general director of the I-Net JSC, in an interview with the Oblastnaya Gazeta.
Our goal is to introduce the same system of payment for subway travel as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk for the 2018 World Cup.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro using their bank cards without buying tokens and without standing in line", he said.
Startups that will keep your company from becoming another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction with her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"It was never consistent or objective", said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce hair care company based in San Francisco.
So she turned to third parties for help.
There's a new kind of HR startup that's emerging that helps companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that measures employee engagement, they allow companies to do express surveys, reach specific teams and demographics, offer employees anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and reach direct management.
"Now that we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, where's Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City-based startup Glints, whose analytics software companies use to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has gained a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel in the three years she has been using Glint.
In addition to the express surveys and team surveys, the product offers a company heat map and shows in visual form which units have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest approval rating, allowing it to understand why.
Companies are slowly realizing that they need to control the workplace or they will become another Uber that got caught up in a scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive environment where those who complained were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
The Let's Talk Payment Internet portal estimates that the global financial technology governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's declining reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized employee surveys, collect confidential real-time responses, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text message hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if a top executive is involved, complaints go straight to the board.
"The court of public opinion has taken power away from the inspectors", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If a company is found to be mistreating or behaving unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quillan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer an easy way to contact the company's head office.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look up the phone number or email address of the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
Often it was a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of legal for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers in offices in other cities or states  such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay  can be detected and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees", said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group at Ruby Tuesday.
And we protect our shareholders from employee lawsuits.
According to Quindland, companies started to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the bankruptcy of Arthur Andersen's accounting firm for ethics violations in the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until social media became widespread that companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Before people used technology to control ethics, they used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that's been embraced by venture capitalists who have backed both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In markets with fierce competition like Silicon Valley, high wages and exciting projects are just the minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued, and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy working for a company, feel heard, and feel that the work they do is productive, they are more likely to work to make that company successful", says Nina McQueen, VP of Global Benefits and Employee Engagement at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make a profit when the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it's no surprise that they're gaining support.
Workplace culture experts say it's important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback, it can give the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn't happen fast enough, or doesn't happen at all, frustration can develop and employees lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared to do 4,000 interviews", says Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
Because if you don't go through with it, the staff will think, "Did you really hear me?
You're not worried?
If you don't care, why shouldn't I?
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action the same day someone reports a problem using Glint.
And after getting feedback from employees who were unhappy with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it retain employees more effectively in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people", Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
New asphalt is being laid on the red army avenue in Barnaul
In Barnaul, drastic measures have been taken to eliminate the cause of the asphalt failure on the Red Army Avenue.
The place where the pits appeared twice on the recently paved road (the intersection with the street of the Young), decided to "open".
The collapse of a small section of the road near the tramway tracks was caused by a landslide in the area of a landlocked network.
According to the deputy chairman of the city committee for road, road, transport and communication Ivan Garmat, a detailed examination will be carried out to eliminate the prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on the results, we'll take the necessary measures.
It is expected that the unmanned communications will need to be rebuilt and concrete-lined.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins are having to work out longer because the NCAA canceled practice twice a day.
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles, are lingering to chat on one side of the team's new training grounds on campus.
Some of them pulled down their shirts, their backs exposed, glowing with sweat after a stressful first day at the sports camp.
For many team players, those idle minutes are a mid-day break.
Players enrolled in summer training will then head back to their dorms after three hours of practice to prepare for final exams, and return to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning for a 6:30 p.m. game.
Just before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim More said, "These guys are going to be a meat cleaver for the next three days".
The fact that the NCAA canceled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the pressure on the players, actually extended their workday  at least until the exams ended on Friday.
So the UCLA team's first three practice sessions were scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit into their already busy schedule.
A side effect of not having two workouts a day has been a greater number of days with one workout, and the Bruins are moving the start of camp almost a week from last year and holding training during summer school for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to have 18 practice sessions through Aug. 20 before officially starting training for their first game of the season against Texas A&M University in September.
More said he supports the National Student Athletic Association's rule change, even though it has added another item to the tight schedule.
"For three or four days we give them this huge load, it's a serious test", said Mora.
And they just got over it, they work, they're great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and have more time, it'll be really cool.
When the camp is over, UCLA will make the practice closed, a challenge that is not easy to do because its fields are in plain sight from the adjacent parking lot and the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that have broken through the net.
The Bruins players are scheduled to stay at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are available during the season, there could be a problem.
"We'll have security", said Mora.
This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger by suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and videotape the workout.
If you have a training video, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security in parking lot number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan.
All victims of the St. Petersburg attack discharged from hospitals
All of the victims of the St. Petersburg subway attack in April have been released from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the vice-governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the data at the end of July, three people remained in the hospital, reports "TV Center".
The explosion in the St. Petersburg metro happened on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by a suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, including the performer.
Eleven people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, have been arrested in the criminal case.
Recall that the day before, Rospotrebnadzor recommended the St. Petersburg metro to review the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook is stepping up fact-checking to fight fake news
Facebook will more often send suspicious text to independent experts and display their findings under the original posts, the world's largest social network said on Thursday, trying to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them for verification, and possibly show the fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main channels for spreading so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also being hotly debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages ahead of the presidential election in May, and Germany announced support for a plan to fine social media if it does not swiftly remove hate-mongering posts ahead of the September election.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced that it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that has been launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what posts are challenged by independent reviewers, people want a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and share", wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook News Feed Manager, in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "linked articles" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the issue of fake news.
To create a comic novel: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny Scottney Castle was featured in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s, it was a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy home in the Beul River valley in Kent, he has watched the tumultuous history around him, and now he has inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a thick head of hair and a penchant for historical documents, to write a comic novel.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago", he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand".
The castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells the story of the families who lived in Scotney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This isn't Rhodes' first book to draw on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories", a collection of British Library documents that touched him unexpectedly.
"I could scratch a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700's by a double agent working for the Jacobites", he says.
"It's his fingerprint".
And the letters always smell like smoke because they used to light fires in those days.
And 300 years from now, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
For someone so obsessed with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the Arts Council England and living in a castle for four months ("I actually stayed there for a bit") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days exploring the "new" Victorian castle, going through archives and examining the estate's many treasures and antiquities - such as the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that had been lying in a ditch for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to the foresters, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
Then at night he "drink whiskey and sit down to write".
Scotney Castle's history is not well studied, because the National Trust only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only just begun to dig into what he described as "something that aristocrats have been putting in the attic for centuries".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring", says Rhodes, "but there were two families fighting over this birch.
It happens, guys!"
In some of the stories in the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for broader explorations in English history: for example, in The Workman, the hero leaves a newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolution of 1381.
"There is a record of a rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex", says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising had begun in these places, and I thought that the uprising was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the castle's history - for example, "The Priest", which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden away by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler", about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with rocks (this was discovered years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells were Rhodes' favorite family of all the Scotties: "The gentlemen seemed to be the ultimate cheaters, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, the Darrel men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women - I imagine them as a company of handsome guys who know how to take care of heirs of great fortunes".
After leaving the castle, Rhodes searches for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish countryside, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamyanmaki, a place where a sanatorium once stood at the beginning of the 20th century, but which was then again overgrown with forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave", he says.
"I was like, 'Damn, I need to get back to real life.'"
Fifteen of the largest banks choose Russia
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC "Optyrie", seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the outgoing organizations will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have announced their split from the ADB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", which is headed by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, as the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy in terms of the number of draft laws prepared.
The conflict within the ADB began during a discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new draft laws, in particular, which envisaged a new classification of banks depending on the size of their authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ADB, said that, in the association's opinion, this bill is being passed in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the opportunities of small and medium banks in the regions, by intercepting their customers.
Among other complaints, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, in Tosunyan's opinion, does not always justifiably revoke licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many of the heads of the fined banks, in particular, Vnesprombank, were in the governing bodies of the ADB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive relationship with the main banking regulator environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, stating disagreement with the policy of the ADB, began to prepare to join the association "Russia", noting that "the efficiency of the work of the ADB is at a low level, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually conducted".
It 's better for the investors .
What's the end?
Let us answer right away the main question that arises in the event of a slight failure or conflict in or near the banking sector: there is no risk to depositors, rather, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
The head of "Russia" is Anatoly Aksakov, known for his sensitivity in everything that concerns the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert evaluations of "regions".
There are no major personnel or organizational changes.
The ADB is undoubtedly in a difficult financial and governance position once it loses such powerful and influential players with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, this oldest organization, established in 1991, which represents the interests of the banking community, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the monetary sector in general.
It is not possible to say that even in the Association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members on any terms, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe, too much will want"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "on the very next day the representatives of the banks that left the Arab Bank asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our Association "Russia"".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Negotiations are underway, proposals from both sides are being studied, and the agenda for the association's extraordinary congress is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll decide.
Also, Anatoliy Aksakov, stressing that "he does not hold on to his chair", called Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, a possible new head of the renewed association "Russia", highlighting his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently on vacation in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia", where the agenda of the extraordinary Congress of "Russia" is scheduled to be considered.
Cars with gasoline engines will not be restricted in Russia
Deputy Minister of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine into major cities of Russia will not be restricted yet.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is to gradually raise the environmental grade.
And there's the concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is, what year?
It's like a slogan phrase, let's ban it.
Where and when?
- What about tomorrow?
Shut down the whole town?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe it will happen", Prime quotes the minister.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Vice-Premier Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study the proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, presented to the government by the general director of KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, the newspaper reports, is the use of ICE cars in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has announced that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, which will change the rules for obtaining a green card.
The plan calls for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and endorsed by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give advantages to candidates who speak English, have the financial resources to support themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media.
The sex robot is real, and it should worry us.
Just when we thought 2017 couldn't get any worse, a new report on the technological advances in sex robot production has come out.
I know.
Sex robots are the focus of attention right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about it, but companies are already shipping them in large numbers to consumers, and we're going to see a lot more of them soon", Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robotic silicone skins that are warm to the touch and almost human-like replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the robot's eyes and nipple to the shape and color of its nails.
But the fact that many robots have "personalities" that would make the Stepford Wife seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have turned into silicone-skinned robots.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize robots for qualities they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion that come with pre-programmed personalities - for example, Cold Farrah seems shy, and Wild Wendy has a "bold" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that matches yours perfectly", reports the website True Companion.
So she likes what you like, doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She changes moods during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be "in the mood!"
The emergence of sex robots is a cause for concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most disturbing is the subservient image of women, the association with rape that comes with possessing the Cold (read: resistant) Farah.
The website True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, only for men.
"If women (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website says.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a shift away from the ideal of gender equality toward the desire for sex with submission as an optional complement.
Most men will not buy sex robots, of course, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the age we live in.
And most people aren't bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights around the world are under threat, when there is a president in the White House who boasts of harassing women.
The scary thing about The Handmaid's Tale is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the squished eyes, but how realistic the vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big right now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical resemblance to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look human to the touch, to mimic the movements of the human body.
But it's the "characteristics" that make robots different from real women.
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life, no biography, nothing that would suggest independence or anything that would shatter the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not be helping our national team in the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This was reported by the general manager of the blue-yellow Andrei Lebedev in an interview with the BeBasket portal.
We tried to talk to Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will give opportunities for the development of our young players", he said.
I remind you: with Jeter's direct participation, the Ukrainian national team took the record sixth place at the EuroBasket 2013 and for the first time got to the world championship in basketball, where the "yellow-blue" could not get past the group stage, and the US native scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 selections and gave 5 passes.
Jeter has not played for the Ukrainian national team since the departure of our American national team head coach Mike Fratello, who left the position in 2015.
The men's EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play their group matches on the Promised Land.
The team of Yevgeny Murzin will have five matches in Group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team played two test matches, losing to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's feat?
Playing Mitt Romney seems pretty reasonable.
It's become commonplace in the Trump era that the political disputes that have polarized the American electorate have broken up some families at a micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the American newspapers were littered with columns about how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense we're about to explode.
There's less talk about Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm writing this because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago who has long been on the Republican side of his family, was visiting me in New York this week.
It reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she's been arguing politics with for decades, suddenly and strangely finds themselves on one side.
At dinner it is certainly good; but I cannot help thinking that in the wider context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed power into the left, but the warping effect of his rule could shift us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll stop being affected by his antics.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" far-right Republicans who, against his standards, suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I found myself missing a lot of Mitt Romney's old-fashioned craziness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to Trump, both seem like very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee will just have to be in his head to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we took the kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York City Department of Parks and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the fiberglass pictures on the central drum - grinning clowns and animals bent over looking at their backs in horror - are extremely ominous, and the ringing music, oddly enough, is delightful.
So many familiar things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings are too far along to be awe-inspiring, and the reality of the city is not catching up.
Thirty-five years later, I still remember the day I found out that the Swiss Cottage district was not really a Swiss chalet (the theme pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" doesn't count) but a large roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women over 40 can have a great time.
If I could give a carousel a grade, I'd give it an A, but luckily, no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars before I passed my card through the terminal.
The coffee shop on my street corner is the same, plus the option to tip 15 percent on the estimate is for the bar.
The result is not only a slowdown in neutral interaction, but also a personal approach to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor store clerk was smiling confusedly as I weariedly rated my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains .
Pistorius is leaving prison for his second doctor's visit.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which the prison administration says he sustained from a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of manslaughter after the prosecution appealed the original verdict of manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her multiple times through the bathroom door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistaken his girlfriend for a night thief who was hiding in his bathroom.
The prosecutor's office has announced its intention to file another protest, this time against Pretorius' six-year sentence, which it says is too lenient.
The Attorney General's Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be heard this year.
The probation could be extended by 15 years if the prosecution succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in NTV journalist beating gets no-go
The capital's law enforcement authorities have chosen a no-go ban for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Wolf.
"As part of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Beating") against a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent in the face of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was given a restraining order in the form of a subscription for non-exit and proper behavior", - said Wolf.
The MIA added that the suspect had been charged with disobedience.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast of Air Force Day, a drunk man approached the reporter and punched him in the face.
As it turned out, the bully had nothing to do with the air force.
According to Razvozhayev, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens were arrested in Greece for illegal tenting
According to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sitonia for setting up tents in a inappropriate place.
They were released the same day while the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Bi-Ti-Vi television channel that the Bulgarian citizens were then released.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught parking in a non-designated area.
The inspections will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses US Vice President of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is with regret that we have to state that Washington is increasingly falling back on the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War, which are completely detached from reality", the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
That's how the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence's words about the "Russian threat" and the attempts to force a border change he made in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the lack of clarity of the thesis about the allegedly unalternative entry of all of Southeast Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to push Kosovo away from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop shaming Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of interests", the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
A paramedic was injured in an accident with an ambulance in Moscow.
The accident occurred in Moscow Stupin, as a result of the collision of the foreign car with the carriage "Ambulances" injured a doctor.
Today, at about 08:10 Moscow time, a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupino in the Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned", the press service of the Moscow region's Ministry of Internal Affairs told TASS.
Law enforcement officers are working on the scene to determine the circumstances of the accident.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son out of a building, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, the Razdelny police department received a report from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement and doctors rushed to the scene and rushed the child to a medical facility", the Odessa police said.
The doctors determined that the boy was born hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
The first-aid kit identified the woman as a 36-year-old local resident.
It's also been established that the woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the headline, the family had not previously been in the eyes of law enforcement and was not on a special record.
The police are currently investigating the circumstances and reasons that led the woman to do this, and a decision will be made.
The baby is under medical supervision.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolaev threw her premature baby into a garbage can.
Grigory Leps: "I'm fighting, even though 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists in Russian pop, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the ceremony, the singer spoke with the "Izvestia" columnist.
I remember your "half-year" was marked.
A special tent in the "Luzhniks", Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You were probably just figuring out how you wanted to spend your next five years.
Did it work?
Speaking of career, it was a good time.
I worked hard, toured the country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He's released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not the same person I was, say, 20 years ago.
You can't fool your biological clock.
It's getting harder to sing the way I did in my 30s.
But I'm still fighting, and I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I feel like I'm on a different level.
You're recording a new album with them, your first in three years.
Yeah, I'm working on it now.
Actually, we've already recorded it in my studio and we're sending it to L.A. for the record.
It's called "Why Are You So Serious?" after a song of the same name that he co-wrote with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it out yet.
We'll do it later when we get the video.
And we'll release the album in November for my anniversary concert series at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow.
Your new record is backed by the great American drummer Chris Coleman.
You were gonna bring him on your tour, weren't you?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the greatest drummers in the world today.
He used to come to my studio, record his parts.
I asked him to join my band, and he asked Jeremy Coulson.
But for prolonged work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
The fees were between €35,000 and €45,000 per month.
I thought I'd find some decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malyshev.
It 's better to feed your own .
Sometimes I want to fight one of them for something.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dossumov is highly regarded internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he's invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after hearing him play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has arrived, with a different technique".
Your album is in L.A., American musicians are working with you, but you can't come to the States?
Are you trying to get that ban lifted?
I'm not really doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I told you I was a student there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful you'll be.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that experience, school.
Our popular music performers have faced no challenge for 70 years that American musicians have always faced.
They were trying to make the best sound possible.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has denied me entry for ten years.
But I'll still apply for a visa at the British Embassy every year so I can be allowed to go back and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe is very kind to me.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco in August, not a booked one, but a poster, right?
Yes, there's a good sports hall in Monte Carlo, I've been there once.
They've invited me back, and as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert are sold out.
You're going to the "Lima Vaikule Date" that starts on July 20th in Jurmala?
She invited me, and of course I accepted.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman, who can present herself with a beautiful voice and even a whisper.
After the tours and anniversary concerts, I know you want to turn to Vladimir Vysotsky's work.
You already have two albums of his songs in your discography.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80 to 90 of Vysotsky's songs in the same order as he did.
Just voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'll be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to get Alexander Rosenbaum to be on the album.
I've been talking to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so we'll see how it goes.
You've gradually added Boris Grebenshchikov's songs to your repertoire.
Maybe you can put his stuff in an album later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I've crossed paths with him a few times and asked if I could sing one of his songs.
He said, "Grigory, I write songs to be performed".
Please try, sing.
I guess it's interesting to record an album like that.
I don't have a project yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might do one.
If you don't focus fully on the business of your production center.
I assume you haven't realized its potential yet, signed all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of artists I wish I had under my wing, but they're independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Sergei is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now is Alexander Panayotov, who I led in The Voice.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, singers like that are rare.
It would be a real shame if he didn't reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a set, I'm making videos.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center, buying them songs, paying poets, sometimes their tracks get into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they don't reach great heights, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a recording album and a couple of videos.
And then, if they want to, they can go their separate ways, and I'm not gonna insist that they pay back the money they put into it.
Although I would love it if one of them could make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not gonna cut anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, push, prove, like I once did.
If you were offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guaranteed entry into the country, would you go?
I'm still invited to that.
It's mostly closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I'm a citizen of my country, a Russian, who, by my own admission, flew to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If they tell me tomorrow I need to fly somewhere else for the good of the country, I will.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that this situation has developed with Ukraine.
Because I believe we are one people and we should be together.
I'm sorry, but that's not likely to happen, at least not anytime soon.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he has collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Svetaya Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are many talented people in Ukraine, and it is a pity that they are not able to fully showcase their talent to a broad Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some cool Ukrainian artist to Russia, like Slav Vakarchuk, and do a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrei Ochlopkov was thrown from the cosmodrome
As it became known to "Ъ", technical director of the cosmodrome Andrey Ochlopkov began work at the State space research and production center (GKNPC) named after Hruniechev.
Previously, he de facto worked on the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the leadership of the Center for the exploitation of the ground and space infrastructure (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow's Philae, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Ochlopkov will not have a replacement. The position of technical director will likely be eliminated, and the functional will be distributed among the CENKI units.
The fact that technical director of the East and deputy director general of the CENKI for technological development Andrey Ochlopkov has moved to work at the Hruniev State Nuclear Power Plant, top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as a government employee told "Ъ".
"He has been working at his new job for several weeks", - said the interlocutors of "Kommersant" in the industry.
The CENCI was unable to provide an immediate comment Thursday, and Mr. Ochlopkov was unavailable for comment.
However, the information of "Kommersant" was officially confirmed by the DKNPC.
He decided to move to the position of director of production coordination, - said the enterprise. - Andrei Ochlopkov fully fulfilled the task set before him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome.
Mr. Ochlopkov joined the CENKI in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome, he held the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Ochlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, regional merchants received state orders for his submission, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean the separated parts of the rockets-carriers in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The responsibilities of the CENKI for technological development extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, who headed the Federal Space Agency at the time, said in an interview with "Ъ" that the situation at the Eastern Space Station "was critical already in October 2013".
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made in planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To complete the construction of the plant by the end of the year, the deadline was moved from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, the CENKI began to install technological equipment on unfinished sites.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Ochlopkov.
Despite the risks and the fact that the launch was postponed (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz took off on April 28, 2016), the idea proved to be correct, a source at the spaceport told Kommersant: "Otherwise we would not have launched a single launch from the Vostochny spacecraft, but would have been engaged in construction".
Vice-premier Dmitry Rogozin, who was in charge of the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Ochlopkov his "cosmic Susanin", but it was almost always him who requested information about the construction process.
Mr. Ochlopkov is also remembered for his frankness: for example, in an interview with "Ъ" he proposed to strip the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstroy) of the status of the sole contractor for the Eastern part of the city and work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of the Special Construction?"
This idea found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the duties of general contractor to complete the construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex by the fourth quarter.
According to the "Kommersant", Mr. Ochlopkov's move to a new job was due to disagreements with the CENKI leadership regarding the way to complete the construction of the facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as the methods of working with subcontractors.
"It was decided that this would be best for everyone", says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East Building.
A government official, in turn, called the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will be difficult to find an equivalent replacement".
According to the "Kommersant", this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be distributed among the divisions of the CENKI.
Music schools will have two-speciality programs
In the future, students in children's music schools will be able to study two subjects at the same time.
According to Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Sviatoslav Golubenko, for this you can re-read students repeated disciplines, and the question of payment for the rest of the classes in the second specialty to solve with the help of special grants, reports "RIA Novosti".
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we together with the expert community will develop a mechanism that will allow you to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education", - said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Not for Children" conversation with the children of the Sirius Children's Center, pupil Maria Andreyeva said that she had to pay for the repetitive subjects of the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano and has won awards in both disciplines.
The head of state recognized her issue as very urgent and promised to help.
A 17-year-old Russian man climbed a skyscraper in Mexico
A 17-year-old Russian man, Kirill N., was detained in Mexico after he climbed a wall into a high-rise building, El Universal reports.
The incident took place in Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed through a three-meter fence into the Nestle office complex and climbed one of its towers.
He did not use any special equipment, such as a safety or rope.
They've arrested a young man on the roof.
Public Safety officials brought him down in a helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They're checking to see if the boy is in the country legally.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a mountain has become popular online.
Users called the boy "spider man".
According to the media, such experiments are his hobby.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help alleviate IBD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help to alleviate symptoms in those with inflammatory bowel disease.
This chronic condition, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy to relieve symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid, tryptophan, promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, the lead researcher, explained that immune cells in the gut keep harmful foodborne microbes from entering the body.
The cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body while not harming sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too much off in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a particular bacteria in their gut develop resistance-enhancing cells.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the formation of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a type of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice ate, the more of these immune cells they had".
He suggested that the same thing would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could promote a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Later, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of immune cell types that increase resistance, found that one group of mice had these cells, while another group, which belonged to the same lineage but was kept separate, did not.
She suggested that the difference may be caused by the gut microbiome of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestinal cells of mice was sequenced, and they found six types of bacteria that are present in mice that have immune cells, but not in mice that don't have them.
Mice raised in sterile environments that didn't have a good microbiome and didn't develop this type of immune cell got L. reuteri, and they developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - free of bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells have turned into tolerance-boosting cells.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells also dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same resistance-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri promote cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people with inflammatory bowel disease, defects in tryptophan-associated genes have been found.
She says: "Perhaps we need to increase the development of these cells, since they are the key to inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
High tryptophan levels in L. reuteri could potentially lead to an increase in their population".
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have hired a genius in the form of Nemanja Matic.
Manchester United have hired a genius in Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40million signing from Chelsea started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season game before their UEFA Super Cup tie against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed as a midfielder, while players such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were breaking through whenever they wanted.
However, as Matic did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game and he only lasted 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires refinement before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is in the way he thinks, he thinks football", Mourinho said.
We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later.
Just like Matic, his new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to form his main squad for the start of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to sign three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by signing three of the four players he wanted to sign first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four", he added.
I'd be even happier if they got me four out of four, but they've already done a lot for me.
Former leaders of Lithuania's Social Democrats are trying to persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition.
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkievičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats, Ceslovaas Yurshenas, appealed to their party colleagues to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by "Parliamentary Gazette", due to friction with partners - the Peasants' Union and the "greens" - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And so three senior experienced comrades addressed their party colleagues with an open letter, which, in particular, said: "The disappointment of our party comrades with the election results is understandable, but the coalition with the peasants has created for us, albeit not very easy, conditions for further implementation of the goals of social justice, which are envisaged in the government program on our initiative, and for maintaining the political dominance of the left center over the right parties".
According to former party leaders, the discussion so far "was dominated by emotion-based expression of opinion without concrete arguments".
The letter's authors fear that their party's reckless actions could lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
Disabled Anton Mamaev fined
The Moscow city court has reduced the sentence of Anton Mamaev , a wheelchair-bound disabled person , from four and a half years to a fine of 200 thousand rubles .
Earlier, the judge of the Timiryazev court released the convict from the SIZO.
The Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, as he organized the robbery and the kidnapping of a scooter from a former special forces fighter.
The Moscow city court has decided to reduce the sentence of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility", - explained "Ъ" press secretary of the Moscow City Court Ulyana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account Mamaev's health condition, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which a punishment below the lower limit can be imposed.
As for Vasiliy Seroshtanov, the assistant of Mamayev, the court did not find any circumstances that would be grounds for changing the severity of the crime and changing the verdict.
Anton Mamaev himself said he was unhappy with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be to be acquitted, to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out appealing the verdict in the cassation court of the Moscow city court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights", he told RIA Novosti.
Anton Mamaev, a 28-year-old resident of Moscow, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in the criminal case last fall.
The disabled man claims that he bought a scooter from a friend for 160 thousand rubles, to sell it later.
However, the owners of the motor scooter, among whom is a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov had taken their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky district court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in prison with imprisonment in a general regime colony (according to part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled man was placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under President Tatyana Moskalkov joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIZO by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
The UNF will prepare a report on ecology for the president
The final "Actions Forum" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be dedicated to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and was confirmed by the head of the executive committee of the movement, Alexey Anisimov.
According to him, after the forum, the "frontmen" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
The ONF's "Izvestie" interlocutors note that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analysis" of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of the event has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for each of the two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The conference will conclude in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
Based on the proposals that were and will be expressed at these events, we will form systematic proposals to solve environmental problems, - told "Izvestia" the interlocutor in the ONF.
Co-chair of the Central Staff of the movement Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the "frontmen" will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNF Action Forum will most likely be combined.
In one year, we've grown into a powerful team of environmental experts, identified loopholes in legislation, stopped dozens of violations.
All of this will be in a report we're preparing for the president as leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "frontmen" report on the work on priority projects of the ONF, - said Olga Timofeeva.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state for environmental protection, ecology and transport issues Sergey Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
He had previously taken part in the ONF Media Forum in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to get environmental protection mechanisms up and running so that they work for many years.
We want to keep these issues on the agenda", Olga Timofeyeva added.
Head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI) Andrey Koliadin noted that the UNF acts in line with the presidential agenda by raising environmental issues.
Many things they as experts have proposed at various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the president, - said "Izvesti" Andrey Koladin.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the UNF, the regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, - the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashiche (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nahodka (a bill on the prohibition of open coal transshipment in settlements has already been developed, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole is created, the question lies in the further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
The decisions taken by the state must be implemented clearly, - says Leonid Bochin, head of the charity foundation "Ecology for All".
Sergey Tsiplenkov, a member of the Human Rights Committee and head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpeace Russia", stressed that for successful environmental problems to be solved, a responsible approach by society and business is needed, and legislative efforts alone are not enough.
Once society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more advantageous step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsiplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violating environmental legislation is an economically advantageous solution for business.
A British inventor has implanted a microchip into his body to get into his home and car with the flick of a finger.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could open his door, walk into his office, and even start a car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers this service through his company, BioTech, to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Winchester, to ensure that the implant procedure was performed according to medical standards.
The technology is like a microchip that you implant in cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces the locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible ones at a cost of £300 per lock.
A married father of one has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 that starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The props for the White House cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars .
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American manufacturing cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 White House event to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials have inspected technology products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi truck.
According to records from the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the unit responsible for controlling the helicopter, the White House War Office ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for an "unusual" event.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusual, widely covered event", the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his commanding officer, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in the event, which was scheduled for 3 p.m., and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return in accordance with the hours of operation restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel remained near the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was unclear from the records obtained by TIME magazine whether a second crew was needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the event violates this order.
"We asked if it was a violation of the Hatch Act, among other things, and we were told no", the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a place to hide", replied the deputy.
The Made in America event was declared an official event by the White House, and it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance health care reform, which was then in the works in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask for them solely for the sake of photography.
Trump was already the subject of controversy in February when a presidential plane flew in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about his predecessor using the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the Made in America showcase, which features products from all 50 states made by American workers from American materials", said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around Washington DC and the South Lawn to practice transporting the President of the United States to the White House with an inch of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight performed for the "Made in America" event was counted as a month's worth of training flights.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of non-presidential support missions.
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits on display.
A representative of Sikorsky said the company had not participated in the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rate for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense's rate of reimbursement for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
Unit records show the aircraft's time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its base at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico, Virginia.
The White House claims the actual cost of using the helicopter is far below that rate.
"It is a complete mistake to calculate the cost to taxpayers based on a roughly approximate refund rate", says Walters.
These approximate rates include staff, maintenance and many other non-refundable costs that are included in the annual allocations.
According to a 2015 study by RAND Corporation, the compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but do take into account fuel costs, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was speaking out in defense of using a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week's Made in America stuff", Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut take great pride in the fact that they're contributing to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to build.
So, of course, it's perfectly appropriate to pay attention to that.
It was unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely sitting in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed the Sikorsky representatives, joking with the press about his own fleet of company products.
"I know the Sikorsky", said the president. "I have three of them".
Moscow will provide grants for city hospitals
The "Life Saving" grants will be awarded annually to the intensive care units and intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The money will go towards the incentives for doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the clinic's inspection, he presented a thank-you letter to the traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Prozco, who performed the most difficult reconstruction of the teenager's foot.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants to the intensive care units of the city clinics.
The money will be used to support doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor, the clinical hospital named after Yudin is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new, modern equipment that allows its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna rural hospital.
The medical facility is currently designed to accommodate more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the intensive care unit and the hospital, there are day wards.
The hospital has a staff of 2,800 people.
The total area of the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February , the medical facility became a participant in a pilot project to organize short-term care hospitals .
They're designed to perform relatively small operations.
The surgical procedure uses advanced medical equipment to significantly reduce the time it takes for patients to recover.
After the operation, they only stay in the hospital for a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36 thousand patients were treated in the clinical hospital named after Yudin.
The clinic's medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying complexity.
The NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications to buy the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This was reported on Friday, August 4, TASS with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni for the agreement on the indirect (through the Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of Sberbank was withdrawn.
"No documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares were received by the NBU", the statement said.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew his application to buy the Sberbank subsidiary.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Gutsereev and Grigory Guseľnikov to acquire the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to check their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
They're not allowed to withdraw capital from the country for the benefit of their parent organizations.

The third season of Narco will be released on September 1st.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on women's role in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, participate, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the acting head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial councils, three women are running for vice-presidency, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative if women are fully involved and included at all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban is threatening to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to advisory roles.
This year's election marks the first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

Venice has tightened fines for tourists who behave inappropriately
The Venice authorities have increased the fine for swimming in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
Walking around the city in a bathing suit or with your torso naked will now be fined 200 euros.
A total of 100 euros will be required from those who organize a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, reports TASS, citing the Association of Russian Tour Operators.
It also mentions that the authorities impose a fine of 400 euros for inscriptions on monuments and 25 euros for garbage.
The campaign #EnjoyRespectVenezia will inform tourists about the need to follow the rules of behaviour in Venice on social media, as well as through advertisements and posters on the city council website, on billboards and in places with the highest concentration of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice's tourism adviser Paola Mar, information about the fines will be passed on to the embassies of the countries of origin of the offenders, thus warning their compatriots against similar mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach", she said.
In April, the city's administration announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
Venice has already successfully restricted the number of tourists visiting the city centre.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch the festival Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 guests were allowed to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium on the establishment of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice has been imposed.

Jazz in "Skolkovo": experiment and improvisation
The program of the second Skolkovo Jazz Science festival, which will be held on August 26 at the Skolkovo Innovation Center, has been announced.
Guests are expected to perform with leading jazz ensembles and soloists, scientific discussions, interactive platforms and other musical and intellectual events.
As the organizers promise, the venue will be an improvisation area and a showcase of new creative possibilities.
"The guests of the festival will be able to immerse themselves in the world of experimental media technologies and learn how innovations in science become a new tool for interaction with art", - said the forum's vice president of the "Sколкоvo" Foundation Elena Zelentsova.
Among the participants of Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 there are many stars, including Igor Butman's Moscow Jazz Orchestra, which will present a joint program with vocalist Yaroslava Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts, and they did not coincidentally merge, - explained the folk artist to "Izvestia".
Experimentation and improvisation are as highly valued by jazz musicians as they are by scientists.
One of the highlights of the festival will be Azekel, a Nigerian-born Briton known for both his own work and collaborations with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
Jazz lovers are eagerly awaiting the first performance in Russia of five-time Grammy Award nominee, pianist Christian Sands (USA) with his trio.
In a new capacity, one of the best academic chamber orchestras "Music of Viva" under the direction of Alexander Rudin and with the participation of pianist Yuri Favorin will try itself.

The experimental artist controls music and video using gestures -- that's how leap motion technology works.
A total of eight musical groups will perform on the two stages of the festival.
In addition, the program includes open discussions, interactive zones and art objects, united by the idea of merging music and science.
Guests can take part in experiments, visit the science buffet and watch the creation of cryoglycerin or shifting sands from starch and water.
In the special vinyl area, you can buy records of current jazz performers and representatives of other musical directions, and at the book fair - publications on various topics, including music, popular science and biomedical literature.
The Supreme Court has released Ozerov from his position as head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Ozerov and relieved him of this position.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk Territory.
The statement asking to be relieved of his position was written by Lake last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life".
The senator also noted that the decision to resign was not an instant one.
Viktor Ozerov has been representing the legislative assembly of the Khabarovsk region in the RF Supreme Council since 1996.
The Senate Defense and Security Committee has been chaired by the senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers in Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial users will be reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation "On making changes to the Rules of the wholesale market of electricity and power and to the aggregate forecast balance of production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia by the subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly ease the life of small and medium enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have been on the threshold of Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power stations on the Angara, flowing from the Baikal, whose main water collection territory is Buryatia.
And it's only this year that the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles per kWh to 3.93 rubles per kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the federal government's decision in the List of wholesale market price zones, for which the features of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the rows of industrial consumers have arrived.
According to analysts, this is just the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt-hour.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for the new tariff moves towards a reduction for Buryatia.
Scooter didn 't scare the Prosecutor General of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
The legend of electronic dance music, the band Scooter flew to Crimea, not afraid of threats from the Prosecutor General of Ukraine.
"The flight went well, and I'm going to have a concert tomorrow", says H.P. Baxter, the band's frontman.
Earlier, the German edition Bild, citing Ukraine's deputy prosecutor general, Yevgeny Yenin, reported that the musicians could face up to eight years in prison for coming to Crimea, which Kiev considers to be temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
Scooter's performance at the #ZBFest festival in Balaklava is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is organized by Golden Balcony to celebrate International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of Germany's most famous bands, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, guests of the festival will be Sergey Galanin and his group "Serga", as well as Garik Sukashev with "Brigade C".
Moscow Metro will host the premiere of the new season of "Game of Thrones"
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of "Game of Thrones" will be held in the capital's metro.
This is reported by the website "Komsomolskaya Pravda".
The first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations as part of the "Night in the Metro" campaign.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
The union is demanding guarantees from the managers of McVitie's biscuit maker over its long-term commitment to manufacturing at its Glasgow factory.
GMB Scotland says the company has been quiet about future investment in the Tolcross facility.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs cookies and Rich Tea, among other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the company that owns McVitie's, says it has invested more than £5 million in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that if there are any changes in the facility, employees and union representatives are the first to know.
In a letter to the manager of the company's facility, GMB Scotland demanded that McVitie's respond to concerns that funding would not be released for the modernization of production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the facility's CEO on business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross".
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in the local community and in the Greater Glasgow area; it is a major pillar of decent work in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and with Brexit, rising living standards and chronic decline in production, the East End of Glasgow desperately needs a boom in manufacturing at McVitie's.
According to a Pladis spokeswoman, "The manager of the tolcross facility just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate our ongoing cooperation with employees and union representatives".
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB staff and representatives, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to our employees about how, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and volatile economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our operations  and this applies to all our facilities and business lines  to remain competitive.
Over the past few years we have invested over £5 million in our cross-country facility, particularly in production lines and performance improvements.
We fully appreciate the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and if there is any change in the work at this facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know.
Putin said the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the cabinet of ministers should be involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNCHK), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as to Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the contradictions.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for the VNCHK is putting the project's implementation period at risk.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
"Gazprom" offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of "Rosneft", but we do not have such resources", - added Sechin.
Recall that Rosneft asked for permission to use gas from the Kirina field of Gazprom, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that talks on the issue were ongoing and that "there are no sharp corners".
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
A La Liga player may regret his interest in Marco Verrattì .
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered £189m to buy him, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record breaking raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window as the League One club were poised to break the world record for transfer fees, more than doubling the previous mark tied to Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
When the transfer is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of over £500,000 a week net.
Barcelona are known to be furious at the way the offer was made and the way Neymar broke the contract, despite a source close to the Catalan club's management insisting that the club has always done its best for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by the president of the PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a stern warning to any club that would like to attract one of the best players in the Premier League.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will go against them, we will make offers to their players", Al-Helaifi said.
We have respect for all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, there will be consequences.
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line when the Spanish club expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrattini earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not let the Italian player go on any terms, and now Barcelona are likely to feel the consequences of their offer in the form of losing one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin has ordered to settle the payments to the victims of the forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a review of the financial assistance being given to forest fires victims and new housing.
I'd like to hear how the job is going today.
I'd like to know how the payments are going, how the compensation is going to be paid to the people who have been hurt.
I'm having some misunderstandings.
"I would like to ask my colleagues about how much money has been allocated", Putin said at a meeting with the heads of the regions on the Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baykal state biosphere reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Russian President's Plenipotentiary Representative in the Siberian Federal District, Sergey Menaylo, and the head of the Baikal branch of the Federal State Bank "Glavrybvod" Leonid Mihailyk.
They told me about the lake cleanup.
Then they showed the fry in an open container next to a container, which they prepared for breeding.
First, Putin released a few of the young from the nest.
Then he pulled a special lever on the top of the container and let the others out.
During the trip, the leader also instructed to understand the ecological situation on the Baikal and build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and another volume is supposedly provided.
"I want to understand what is happening with our financing", the Russian leader stressed.
Recall that during the forest fires of 2017, the fire covered the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region, destroyed houses and farm buildings.
Ukraine wants to send Russians to jail for illegally crossing the border
The Ukrainian parliament has approved a bill that would impose criminal penalties on Russians who illegally cross the Ukrainian border.
According to RT, a document registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian parliament provides for a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens who try to illegally enter the country.
It is noted that for repeated offenses or acts committed by a group of persons, the prison term can be increased to five years.
If the offender is caught with a weapon at the border, the prison term will increase to eight years.
Earlier it was reported that Ukrainian border guards detained Ukrainians trying to get into Russia outside the established checkpoints.
Magnet is up for sale.
The second-largest food retailer in terms of revenue, Magnit, announced the opening of three test stores of the new Magnit-Opt format, which are designed to buy products in small wholesale.
The company's press release said that the retail market remains open.

The relevant decree of the Russian Government will enter into force today, August 4.
The boundaries and types of economic activities of the TOR in the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia are defined.
The city, which has a population of 15,000, will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurial activity, as well as a minimum amount of capital investment by residents, a minimum number of new permanent jobs.

The Government of the Republic has already signed framework agreements on the implementation of 8 investment projects.

In January 2017, the regional authorities reported that Khakassia had fulfilled all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the creation of the TOR.
The authorities of the Orenburg region did the same.
There, in the city of Novotroytsk, a territory of advanced social and economic development will also be created.
This will diversify the economy of the monopoly city, reduce its dependence on the city-forming enterprise of Ural Steel, as well as create more than 2,3 thousand jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of economic activities that will enjoy special legal protection for entrepreneurs in the new TOR includes, in particular, freshwater fisheries, the production of feed, medicines and medical materials.
Novotroytsk became the first of the monogroup of the Orenburg region to receive the status of a TOR.
Recall that the territory of rapid development is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges, which is created to attract investment to improve the lives of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of the TOR, the following can be distinguished: income tax of not more than 5% for the first five years, and not less than 10% for the next 5 years, social contributions of 7.6% for 10 years, use of the free customs zone regime, preferential regime of connection to various infrastructure facilities, as well as preferential rates for rental.
