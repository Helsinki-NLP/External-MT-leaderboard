Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, have total of 29 percent
The first preliminary results of the Austrian early parliament elections have resulted in a perceptible weakening of both parties in the present large coalition and a substantial boost for the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), where the current head, Wilhelm Molterer, is severely affected, suffered particularly great losses.
Conversely, the campaign leader of the Alliance for Austria’s Future (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing for a successful return to national politics.
The preliminary results show that the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, but it has lost 5.5 percent since the last elections in 2006.
EPP, with its 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of votes, took even worse.
The worst results of both large parties in Austrian post-war history are these, and particularly for the People's Party, who called for the early elections, it is literally a catastrophic result.
The People's Party still had a large lead on SPÖ in the polls.
However, they apparently voted for the government to flounder.
In the first reaction to the results, there were already speculations about the possible resignation of the party head and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers expect that this could take place as early as at the extraordinary meeting of the party leadership on Monday.
This development would certainly simplify the journey to the most likely recourse from the election results, that is the renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
Given the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) gained a preliminary 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - the Social Democrats feared a repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists on a common government, which eventually led to sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already announced that he is prepared to work with any party and presumes he will return to Vienna to national politics, is probably banking on this development.
The Green Party also got into the parliament but suffered a small loss and slipped from fourth to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
However, no other parties exceeded the four percent mark and got into the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India could worsen
According to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if the problem of the Czech scientists charged in India with the illegal collection of beetles, a certain worsening of Czech-Indian relations could occur.
The minister made this statement in New York following his meeting with Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
If it is not resolved, then yes, a certain worsening would occur.
After the negotiations, Mukherjee said that it was difficult for the Executive branch to intervene in judicial matters.
In the case of Petr Švácha, who was cleared of charges and penalized with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, under the jurisdiction of which the matter is.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it is best for Emil Kučera to appeal to higher authorities.
Then he can request to be released on bail and wait for the verdict outside the jail, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke of this during the negotiations.
The head of Czech diplomacy said that if he appealed to higher court, it would be possible to pardon him.
The only way Czech side can be involved in the whole matter is to provide the sentenced individuals with competent legal support, the Indian minister said.
The Indian side is already providing them with such aid.
It is in our greatest interest to maintain the best relations with India, which have long standing tradition.
Indians also recognise this," Schwarzenberg said.
The same time, as he told Czech Press Agency, he stressed that the Czech Republic has a great interest in the problem of Czech entomologists.
They are a serious mistake, and we believe in the arrest and charge of these Czech scientists to be a huge mistake.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise from India to pursue the matter.
The only phrase he used was "I have already received several promises".
Czech referees battle for ocean floor
Then he steps towards the electronic wall map depicting Australia and the surrounding sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
This island and the ocean floor around it belongs to Australia.
The area is as large as the continent itself.
The Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows what he is saying and occasionally adds something.
Zest and enthusiasm for work dominate here.
The ocean floor hosts a very little known world of natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, ores, and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that may play a key role in the development of a cure for cancer.
A floor larger than the continent
Coastal countries have begun to fight for the new underwater territory.
The rights are based on the 1982 agreement in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the agreement, that country has the exclusive right to all resources of the continental shelf.
According to a basic theory, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the ocean floor, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea and its substratum.
It reached beyond the edge of the coast, often even beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone.
The request the country sends to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf must be supported by scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparedness work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and specialized technical assistance.
The Commission has already discussed five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have been successful so far.
The success of Australia, which was the first to expand its underwater domain, was registered worldwide.
New Zealand also gained - the ocean floor that the Commission gave to it is around 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly six times the size of the country itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars into surveying.
The profit that will follow from the use of the ocean floor in future will be priceless.
Other countries will gradually submit their request.
They have until ten years from the moment they ratified the "Montego Bay Agreement" to do so.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the agreement as the "common heritage of humankind" begins.
Here no country has any exclusive position any longer.
Mining rights in this area are granted through the international institution.
"But the ocean floor is no Klondike", Director Mikulka says, adding that his individual areas are legally clearly delimited and their regime is anchored in contracts.
Czechs in Pacific
Part of the ocean floor currently belongs to Czech Republic.
It shares it with other countries from the former Eastern Bloc in the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
By agreement, this organization, like the investors of several small countries, gained the status of so-called "pioneering investor" in 1991.
It is authorised to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, which lies between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czech Republic.
The ocean floor is rugged, it is a sort of underwater model of the Tatra Mountains.
"It is possible to mine there on an overall area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich area for the collection of poly-metal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese.
The Macedonian lawyer from the division, Rober Sandev, brings one such concretion to demonstrate.
It looks like a small potato or, with a bit of fantasy, the mythical shem, which, according to legend, brought the Golem to life.
German Special Forces Present at Hostage Rescue
In order to resolve the crisis, the Egyptian government requested help from Germany - which sent the experts.
When push came to shove, the special forces were ready, but they were not required in the end.
More details are emerging on the circumstances surrounding the release of the eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt.
According to the German Federal Ministers of Defense and of Interior, German special forces indirectly participated in the rescue mission.
Military specialists of the Federal Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) and its GSG 9 and Air Guard Special Units were present at the rescue, according to spokesmen of the ministries.
The German forces were not required, however, because the captors abandoned their prisoners and fled when they realized that they were about to be freed by force.
The Egyptian government accepted the offer of Germany to rely on the German forces as backup for the operation.
'Luckily, it did not occur,' a spokesman of the German Federal Ministry of Interior said.
The travel group consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian companions was abducted on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After their abduction in a desert region in south of Egypt, the hostages were carried back and forth across the border region between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the captors remains unclear, as do details on the rescue or possible ransoms.
The former hostages have arrived safely and soundly in Cairo, meanwhile.
German Foreign Minister Steinmeier said they have been entrusted to the care of the German Embassy.
The rescue officer did not comment on details of the rescue.
In Berlin, no immediate information on their return to Germany was given.
The five tourists and the special forces are to board an Airbus of the German Air Force, which is expected to arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Bailout
The 700 billion dollar bailout package for the financial markets narrowly failed to pass in the first two chambers of the US Congress.
The Dow Jones took a nose-dive.
With a vote of 227 to 206 against, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for the financial markets.
All appeals by President George W. Bush and leading officials of both parties, no majority was reached for the program that was designed to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic campaign, supporters had tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar plan's merits.
Barney Frank, the main Democratic negotiator, had called on representatives for approval, even though it was unpopular.
Political approval is difficult for preventing something that has not yet happened.
While the vote was still going on, the Dow Jones saw a significant drop of more than six percent, or 600 points.
It was caused by investors' fears that the government bailout might fail.
It recovered shortly after the end of the vote, but took another nose-dive when the rejection was made public.
Experts now expect further heavy turbulences in the international financial markets.
For the plan to be implemented, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel Agencies Report Increase in Bookings
It is going to be a good winter for German travel agencies, apparently:
The survey says that the turnover of bookings for the coming months has increased significantly over the previous year - for the winter season by as much as 30 percent, even.
Although weak economy, Germany's travel appetite remains unaffected, a survey says.
While bookings during the winter season saw an increase in turnover of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, the German Travel Association (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to GfK, there has been an increase in bookings in the autumn months.
Travel agencies saw an increase in turnover of about 10% for October versus 2007, the DRV said.
The results are based on the figures of GfK, which processes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies every month and use them to make forecasts for the whole market.
Included are travel bookings made through August 2008.
The weak dollar means that trips to the United States were in demand, the DRV said.
In this area, bookings had increased by about one third, it said.
The aside, it pointed to Spain, Turkey and Greece as popular among Germans, as well as domestic regions.
All-inclusive trips were particularly sought-after, DrV President Klaus Laepple said.
In light of increasing energy and food prices, they were more easily calculated for clients than individually organized vacations.
Consumers can save money through early bird or all-inclusive discounts, Laepple said.
The summer months have been very well-booked, and the number of travelling Germans has declined compared to the previous year.
My First Time at Oktoberfest
Spring break and after-ski style hits in repeat mode, beer from one-litre mugs and celebrities in designer Dirndln.
A Wiesn Debut.
Technically, Susanne Kronzucker and I have little in common.
She is blond, TV host and wears a custom made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, am a student, and my dress is second hand.
The one thing that connects us is that we have been at the Wiesn for only three minutes, and already the photographers are crowding around us and snapshooting away - very flattering, and my first visit to the Wiesn.
This is how you make friends.
The cheapo Dirndl seems to be doing its job.
For a Wiesn tourist usually based north of the `Weisswurst equator' that comfy feeling wearing traditional Bavarian garb has left much to be desired.
Theresienwiese is not as bad as all that.
All people are wearing Dirndl or Lederhose, nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed - it's all normal.
Only my Dirndl apron drew weird glances at the chocolate-banana vendor.
A Munich woman pointed to my apron wrongly: ‘Available left, virgin in middle, committed right, widowed behind.’
Very swiftly I pull my apron from behind to left.
'Looks about right,' she says, and laughs.
Others are less concerned with subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats that say ‘Too drunk to get dressed’ and, without prompting, show people their naked behind.
The young man with exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, is from England and it is his first time at the Oktoberfest.
Then he says it is 'gorgeous,' with a long, extended ooooo.
The man is telling me this right after getting rid of the Maß he had previously.
Right next to one of those fireplugs that everybody mistakes for waste dumps.
So Bob is one of those infamous Wildbies.
Others are not quite fortunate to lose the alcohol in this way.
The location is being visited by a number of paramedics, waiting for the poor birds.
The medics always appear in packs - there are always four at a time, carrying a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: When it is empty, they head out, and when it is full, they return.
You cannot see who is inside the BAC coffins.
The paramedics shouted, 'They are the ones that cannot take any more,' a paramedic shouted, disappearing in the crowd.
Accident victim identified by police
A 63-year-old woman pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the town.
The patient was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died.
After the accident a 51-year-old man was arrested for careless driving.
The man has since been released on police bail.
Turkey's widening diplomacy horizons
The European powers wanted to penetrate Turkey's hinterland.
The western side of the Bosphorus, maybe just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most famous relics of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
The guidebooks tell you that.
The building is located on the end of the platforms with a tower at each of its front corners looking for all world like a provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building weakly decays.
Then, once inside the locked ticket office, no doubt about the enormity of the enterprise of which this was the westernmost gateway.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, aimed at making its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by using this railway running to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
The German imperial ambitions started in World War I.
It was attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the freeze boundaries of the Cold War, has gone up in recent years.
British and Dominion forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And a negative news for Hyderpasha station also.
In 1917 an ammunition train blew up destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly fallen away, largely bypassed by history.
This gateway to Anatolia and all points east, serves as a symbol of Turkey's widening diplomatic horizons.
The governing Justice and Development party - the AKP - has crafted a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, which was created by the freeze boundaries of the Cold War, has gone.
Now there is a new policy of engagement.
The Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To gauge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night sleeper to Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's most important foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - some ten and half hours later - after a jolting ride along tracks that produce the old world cadences of The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new secular state - which is expected to be a new secular state - which is expected to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
The AKP with its well-known Islamist roots represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has prompted some suspicion in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - purpose-built - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-constructed shopping centres and power-patisseries, where middle management in business suits meet to make early morning deals.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Ties, tie, I believe he was even packing a Blackberry.
The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly, he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its hinterland.
Today it had to look eastwards and westwards at the same time.
It was not a case of one or other.
It had to do both.
"But surely at some point, Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey, he said, was not going to have to face that choice."
Then he stressed a point that most people I have spoken to here have recited almost by rote: Turkey's ties not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea are as much to Europe and the USA as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that Europe as a whole can literally ride those rail lines eastwards to Asia and Middle East.
Then at Hydarpasha station, after another large sleepless night, I thought of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who watched this building being built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle East ambitions may now, to a large part, be in Turkey's hands.
Then as I waited at the terminal for the ferry to take me back to the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe."
Then at least there was no doubt as to which continent should take claim to this fascinating country.
Remembered: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes:
Then in the next year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to be for under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were in our late 20s.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-changer) represented the choir's willingness and ability to tackle any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether uncompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for the music which remained constant throughout the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let the music speak for itself".
The composer knows what he wants.
It is all there in the music.
So sing!"
The baton technique was very clear and precise, but never controlled or florid.
Whatever the musical standard, he always raised it even higher.
John Frazer Turner writes:
If any conductor should be knighted it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two years he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
The past 40 years I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any single one.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
The conductors, in his words, "hawked one or two well-known war horses around the world".
The memories of him will be shared by so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Becket writes:
The obituary of William Woodruff (Sep 25) states that "in 1946 he resumed economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a Houblon-Norman Research Fellow... simultaneously studying for a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
The summer of 1951 was spent in the US on a Houblon-Norman fellowship, and the summer 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to gloss over this part of his career is unclear.
J Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, taken in documentary style, are remarkable.
The photos attracted my attention because of their simplicity and power which transmit, always treating the subjects with particular attention.
An exhibition that performs deep feeling.
Resino is able to capture magic moments.
Second assault on Honda's super-selling
Next November Honda will launch marketing of the second Jazz model generation.
If previous model was characterised by high habitability, this new minivan has a wider interior space.
In addition, it is equipped with fine mechanics that increases the driving comfort and allows to save fuel.
Evolution instead of revolution.
Honda Jazz' second generation is now available.
While aesthetically the new Jazz looks like the previous model, changes brought to the minivan are numerous.
among others, it is worth mentioning its innovative design, new platform, bigger size and pretty new mechanics.
However, before moving on to analysis the new model, it may be helpful to point out that this new model will be introduced only six years after the first generation.
The first observation should be that Honda has renewed this model more quickly than most other companies do.
Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, but it remains a phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is the case of Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also in this 2008.
The model was sold for about a million units from its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units sold in six years.
The new Jazz is expected to increase its sales in the segment.
The company estimates that in 2007 it sold 83,000 units of this model, in 2009 it estimates it will be around 100,000 units.
Regarding the Spain market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of total sales for the company in Spain.
With the new generation coming, the company in Spain expects to sell around 2.000 units of Jazz in one year.
The arrival of the new Honda Jazz will likely reduce the lowering of sales in Spain by a large extent.
The owners of the brand expect to get to the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units, which is 4.000 units less than in 2007. The numbers are expected to be 4.000 units less than in 2007.
However, despite the increase in sales, Honda has also increased its market share in Spain, reaching the 1.8% compared to last year 1.6%.
The Japanese company expects to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in another new model of its.
This is Insight, a hybrid five-door compact car, 4.37 meters in length.
According to the markets and Japanese manufacturers' estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will come from the United States, while the rest of the 50% will be from both the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the early next year, shortly after the presentation of the model inside the company in January in Valenza.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its entirety.
It now has 3,90 meters length (five centimeters more), 1,69 meters width (two centimeters more) and its interaxle 2,50 meters with an increment of five centimeters.
It remains unchanged.
With the size, its spatial capacity increases.
This advantage is first of all from the new platform and second from the central location of the fuel tank, a solution previously adopted in the previous Jazz.
The trunk's capacity - a double bottom volume - rises to 399 litres, a 19 litres bigger capacity than the first generation.
The Honda Jazz 1.4's measures are the same as the Honda Jazz 1.2's measures, while the trunk capacity in model 1.2 is only 379 litres.
Other improvements - including external elements such as the rear led or the possibility to mount the panoramic glass - include improved access to the back seats.
The doors that allow access to the back seats now open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees in the first model.
In addition, all engines are very new in this second generation of cars.
At the time of marketing, this small model will have a petrol engine of 1.2 or 1.4 litres.
Both mechanical systems will include the i-VTEC technology, which allows lower fuel consumption, reduces carbon dioxide emissions, optimizes the mechanical refinements and maintain high torque engine in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre version achieves a power of 90 hp at 6000 rpm with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
The propulsion - which in previous Jazz reached the 78 hp – requires 5.3 litres of fuel and produces around 125 grams of CO2 equivalent.
Contrast to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 hp, the new one can take advantage of 100 hp.
The 1.4 Jazz with 100 hp reaches a combined 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
A 'bee-car' to prevent collisions
In development of the technologies for preventing accidents, Nissan was inspired by nature and particularly by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that imitates the flight of bees and can prevent accidents.
This is the Biomimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step to project technologies for the prevention of collision.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this little robot in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific Research and Technology of the University of Tokyo in Japan.
The BR23C is an expansion of the Security Shield of the four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is aimed at improving the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles produced by the company.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval personal space that is very similar to the Nissan Security Shield.
The most important element is the bee's compound eyes, which can see all directions with an extra 300 degree angle, allowing the insect to fly with no interruption inside its personal space.
Then, to recreate these visual features, engineers developed what they defined as a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism detects obstacles within 2 meters and a radius up to 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board that immediately prevents the collision.
The little robot imitates the bee's movement and changes direction immediately by turning the wheel at a right or wider angle to prevent the collision.
The most evident difference with any existing system is its evasive action which results in totally instinctive action.
If it were not so, the robot would not be able to react quickly to obstacles, explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Laboratory of Mobility and Head of the project.
The robot cannot shift upwards or downwards, or even diagonally. It can only move in two dimensions and in the direction its wheels turn.
The rotation function is a combination of the acceleration and deceleration functions to allow the little robot to prevent collisions.
This device only needs to process new information every few seconds, and act from this data.
It does not require any information or to use the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers. For this reason it can go without interruption supplied by a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we are not talking about gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step towards developing new technologies for the prevention of collisions, a technology Nissan hopes to be introduced in cars as standard feature within ten years.
The robot uses Lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion typology.
The potential application of this technology could be the integration of this technology with the GPS satellite navigator to bring the driver to a specific destination, avoiding obstacles along the path.
Do not hide before applying for a loan
The US Treasury Department, having quite good capital to act, does not lack of talent.
While fighting the crisis and preventing Americans from being cheated with garbage loans by banks under doubt of insolvency, they created a fun and educational game for Internet users. This is "Bad Credit Hotel".
The "Hotel of bad credit" or of problems.
The gloomy aspect of this hotel and its receptionist aim to encourage people to think not only once but even three times before applying for a loan.
Also, to think quite carefully about where you are applying for it. This is probably the main goal of the game.
The system contains several helpful information, but offers very little details.
It is much more a web page for teens than a general website.
What happens if you complete the game?
The room appears inside the hotel.
It is still something, because about buying a house... better to leave it.
Morgan Stanley opened its capital to MUFG in January.
Morgan Stanley has announced its entry into the table round of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, who will spend nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, news that has been received by a sharp drop in share prices.
The two banks have explained that MUFG would acquire 9.9% of Morgan Stanley shares at a price of 25.25 dollars, totalling three billion dollars.
The selling price is less than 19% of the value of the securities on 31 August.
Additional six billion dollars will be invested in the acquisition of convertible bonds providing a secured yield of 10% and a conversion price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley affirmed that the overall operation would be based on an average unit price of 29 dollars, or 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley shares lost 6.79% to 23.07 dollars around 17:00 GMT.
The strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of holding bank, according to John Mack, the CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this new status last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but it must pass through the Federal Reserve.
The alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis has forced the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday show that the deal has been changed in recent days: on Monday, Morgan announced it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $ 8.5 billion.
Since we started thinking about the participation to be entirely composed of ordinary share.
The current economic and market situation requires minimizing risks and protecting our backs.
Based on the weighted average price MUFG will pay for its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
The transaction will result in a dilution of around 20% per share.
The agreement requires that MUFG may convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they traded more than 50% above the conversion price, about $ 47 for a given period.
Morgan Stanley guarantees that the provided capital will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
The group’s spokesman, however, declined to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley forecasts a Tier One capital ratio of about 15%, which is among the best in the industry.
Morgan says that has "significantly reduced" its balance sheet since the end of August.
Recent weeks have been difficult for the group, which saw half its share price drop and the insurance costs against default on its debt soared.
This cost reduced on Monday but remained at a new high level, around 12%.
The only other surviving major investment bank on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch acquired, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Rebuilding around the Republic of the 20th century socialism.
This is a joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like its counterparts and friends, it is the third to vote on a draft constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results based on 80% of the votes.
Based on these results, the no vote got 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid, and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the vote plus one.
Both polls conducted outside the polling stations and one non-governmental organization announced a large victory for the "yes" of a range between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed during the night from Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed so overwhelmingly," he added, congratulating the Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, 280 km southwest of Quito.
Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which was conducted peacefully under the scrutiny of the Organization of American States (OAS), covered 444 points that further promote the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft constitution establishes the state's control over the economy, by reserving it the "development planning" of a country mainly based on the oil extraction by foreign companies and the foreign money they send to their emigrants.
The project is supported by Correa, who was elected in 2006, and will be able to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use that power to seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health services and education that the president has begun establishing in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also anticipates the prohibition of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for using Ecuador as a launch base for US drug operations.
The 19 prisoners were released in Chad.
The Egyptian commando squad launched an assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts.
They are in Cairo.
The European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were returned on Monday afternoon without arms to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
According to the reports, the prisoners arrived around 1530 hours aboard a special plane at the military base of al-Maza, attached to the international airport of Cairo.
The two were immediately transferred via helicopter to Maadi, a residential area of Cairo, to undergo examinations.
The captors are in good health, and no ransom was paid to them.
Captured on September 19 during a safari in a 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat at the borders with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages was tossed around from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group is 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the Director of Aegyptous Agency, organizing the safari.
The Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, carried on two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
The explosion followed, and half of the kidnappers were killed, and the other went on to flee.
The Egyptian special forces "rapid response" unit has been sent to Sudan as a whole, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomatic corps Franco Frattini in Belgrade, where he currently is, mentioned the role of Italian secret agents and elements of the Special Forces.
However, we must recognise that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and effectiveness of our men from the secret services, from the special forces.
The prisoner also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 patrol vehicle on board of which were the captors, killing six, including the Chadian head, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), something that the movement has immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
The culture finance debate has been a headline and has become a huge topic in this election campaign.
Good.
The other sector of our cultural life always remains forgotten.
Who will come forward to denounce the misery that is granted to small museums, archives, archaeological or national historical sites who are starving for funding?
What politician can remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings?
In Quebec, Canada, we have no real laws that effectively protect our heritage?
What do you know about the French government’s donation of three and half million Euro for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors have written in their country’s Constitution that heritage protection is part of American culture and that such heritage must be protected by all the citizens, all the elected and all the government departments, and this, in co-operation.
In Quebec, the Federation of Quebec History, at least 40 000 volunteers grouped in 211 agencies for history, heritage, archives and genealogy are involved in researching the history, preserving, having few funds, private archives, and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with a sense of fear when developers and builders launch their bulldozers against our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a history and heritage forum?
Fortis bank partially nationalized by Benelux governments
Both the Benelux States are going to help Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch bank - which is the first European financial institution in trouble due to the follow-up effect of the American lending crisis - by a partial state buyout.
The end of this week, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Netherlands governments took up this issue at the highest level, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the Competition Commissioner of the European Commission.
Within the Euro zone, Fortis is the first bank hit by the international financial crisis approaching in waves in the last 12 months. Thus, from a certain perspective, the decisions made may be considered precedent.
The decision was made on Sunday night, each government will take a 49 percent stake in Fortis banks in its respective countries.
The bank will certainly sell some of its stake, especially the insurance activities, acquired from the Netherlands ABN Amro last year.
shares started to drop last week, then in the second part of the week signs of a serious crisis appeared at the company.
Analysts agree that the bank - with its 85 000 employees - is too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The bank shares fell by 12% on Friday, which is the record low level for 14 years.
The value of the shares has declined by two thirds since January.
According to current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion. However, company directors say this is not accurate.
The management believes the uncertainties overseas - linked to accepting the American package of USD 700 billion - for the fall of Fortis shares.
The stocks showed a slight rise on Monday.
Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Chief Executive Officer of the bank on Friday.
The financial Institute was also seeking private buyers but no substantial offer has been made.
The Belgian government earlier declared that the investors had no reason to worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic has been developed among the bank customers; no bank rush has occurred.
Fortis has own banking establishment in Hungary and has acquired leasing companies.
Fox In Henhouse
The American life and health insurance companies often refuse to sell insurance to some citizens, due to drug purchase data.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market becomes uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that requires the permission of the person concerned to use the drug prescription data.
It should be independent, otherwise the fox will be guarding the hen-house.
Insurance companies decide on the insurance fee and the amount to be paid in case of damage based on the health condition of the applying customer, and if they consider it too risky, they do not provide insurance.
The applying customers used to be sent to have a medical examination, and the contract was completed based on the results of the screening.
Dick developed a much cheaper method ten years ago: on the basis of the customer's identification number the type of drugs purchased by the customer in the last 18 months can be easily detected, thus the programme can draw the consequences of the illnesses the applicant suffers as well as their health.
Examples of regularly buying large doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs practically indicate that the customer has untreatably high blood cholesterol level, which would immediately cause the person to be placed in a higher risk category.
The programme has many versions in trade, some of them even define the risk factor, thus the insurance company has no other to do but paperwork.
The advantages of some drugs are that they can be used for several purposes, such as some medical formulas are used to treat migraine, heat waves or even depression.
The latter one is a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, while the other two are not.
There are specific companies involved in obtaining and processing data, and they ask patient permission to acquire the necessary information from the pharmacies.
The workers are already obliged to do so, though previous failures have not been penalized.
Some companies process even laboratory examinations and connect them to drug consumption data. This way they can provide more accurate information on the patient's health condition.
More and more companies gain access to the data and, alongside, control of its use becomes more difficult.
There is a specific act on health care data protection but its scope includes only health care providers and insurance companies.
The bill on providing inspection power for the authorities over companies dealing with data provision has been sent to the Congress.
Dick Richard realizes that it is not enough, and that is why he has further developed his programme, which now restricts data transfer without the express consent of the person concerned.
The other question is that the applicant cannot really refuse consent, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude contract with them.
So hens, at a certain degree, will continue to depend on the benevolence of the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
European Union and India Double Trade
As the European Union and India are leading trade partners, the ninth summit was also dominated by this issue, along with other, mainly global, problems.
Today a France-India Summit is going to be held, mainly on nuclear power co-operation.
Though the European Union recognises India as an emerging democratic world-power, which should be granted more rights in international affairs, the Member States have not reached an agreement yet on whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council or not.
This was not forced at the ninth summit, organized in Marseille yesterday.
Nicolas Sarkozy as Rotating President of the Union, Committee President José Manuel Barroso and Foreign Policy Head Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and agreed to double, i.e. increase to more than 100 billion euros in 5 years.
Since the exchange of goods reached 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
According to the agreement, 26 existing civil aviation conventions with India have been legally harmonized, meaning that air traffic can wing in the future.
India is planning to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate harmonizing.
The goal is to find balance between India is number one EU trade partner and New Delhi is only the ninth place on the list of EU partners.
The summit focuses on global issues:
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was condemned in every form by both parties and the UN Conference was urged.
The Doha Trade Round was also expedited, but both parties are responsible for the fiasco so far.
The EU confirmed to maintain its energy and climate programme, meaning to aim to reduce air pollutants emission by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India agreed to this as well with the goal to reach a global agreement at the climate conference which is due next year and to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 50% until 2050.
Other goal was to prevent food prices growth and a call for an international conference to review financial crisis was supported.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to a bilateral meeting in Paris today, where he is expected to reach an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear power.
Paris expects French companies to be awarded contracts to build nuclear reactors in India for a value of 20 billion euros.
The agreement would be in force for 15 years.
Three hundred Italian editors in Frankfurt
Italian editors at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the sixtieth anniversary of Buchmesse, the most important international event for copyright exchange.
The International Book Fair at Frankfurt expects for this occasion seven thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries, which will occupy the 171 790 metres squared of ground with over 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey will be the guest of honour.
Francesco Maria Giro, the Undersecretary for Cultural Heritage and Activities will represent Italy at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: in fact Italy will be present as an institution with an Italian Stand – 264 metres squared of exhibition space.
Next will be the press conference at the Room Struktur of the Pavilion 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion for figures, trends, and a view of Italian publishing industry.
According to data, the importance of foreign authors in Italian production is gradually declining, and particularly in children and adults.
Found the aeroplane of Steve Fossett the millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at 3000 metres altitude in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
In the airplane, no human remains were found.
The investigation has been completed, and now we have confirmation that it is the one on which Steve Follett was flying the day he disappeared.
Afterwards, the sheriff pointed to no human remains on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The wealthy man, 63 years old, died in February.
The American National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) has reported that some hours after the wreck an investigatory team was sent, which then identified the aircraft: It is the Bellanca 8KCAB, which has been missing since 3rd September 2007.
Today, always in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some personal effects of Fossett were found by a couple near their house in Mammoth Lakes.
The items are two documents in the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, some cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett was called off a month after he disappeared.
The millionaire had gained his place in history thanks to a series of world records.
In 2002, at his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the round the world trip in a hot air balloon: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later he took the world trip by plane without landing.
The most recent record of his career is flying at 15,445 metres above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising that is not waiting for you
The exclusive SUV is an exclusive SUV with a distinctive design defined by decisive lines, ample surfaces and clean cut corners.
GLK is the latest addition to the "compact" off-road vehicles from the starred manufacturer, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe fresh air into the sector.
The features are out of the traditional norms, the message will be unexpected and unconventional, and it will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17th.
The campaign that will accompany the launch of the new vehicle will set off a new communication method, which also includes a futuristic campaign of 3D billboards, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
The project will be a series of large billboards, set up in three different phases, which will dominate the most central Milanese shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new communication will start with a presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed in the vicinity of Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in true size and 3D format.
In fact, looking at the image one will get the sensation that the car protrudes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina 8 all the details of the new GLK will be illuminated at different times, and then re-composed as a single image.
Without doubt, Mercedes, through this advertisement, is trying to introduces something new into the conventional field of automotive publicity.
What will happen with this formula to attract future buyers?
Here is who the Italian hooligans are.
Tri-Veneto, liable to be banned from attending sports matches (Daspo).
The 150-200 people who are now ashamed of Italy are the members of the group "Ultras Italia" who for years has been supporting the national football team and to date has never caused major problems.
No clash has been reported with opposing fans.
The group's extraction is right wing.
Promoters are from Tri Veneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
This has been joined by some small groups (in reality, very few members) from Campagnia and Puglia.
The militants have tricolour flags with the city of origin of the militants on them: on Saturday, they have been removed so that they cannot be identified.
Their ideas are taken up from English fans.
In Bulgaria they found real Nazis, the Levski group.
The FIGC had provided the Italian fans with 144 tickets for the match, all personal and therefore easy to check.
The Interior Minister at Viminale checked them all: among those going to Sofia no group was banned, no group was forbidden to visit stadiums.
Four Italian supporters, who had previous stadium-related crimes, were given tickets and kept from going.
The Interior Ministry is waiting to read the official records from the Bulgarian police before taking any action.
International banishment which prohibits the attendance of not only stadiums in Italy but also all Europe.
Our hooligans, shortly, would not enter another stadium.
The opportunity is very good.
It is now a fear of emulation, that is that others join in the few more than one hundred and fifty.
They claim that we must immediately put out this conflagration and not legitimise those who act in this way.
So, "eyes wide open especially since the National team is playing on Wednesday at Lecce".
In Puglia there is a small nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters.
Today the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the CASMS which can count on a section of the AISE, that is the secret service, which handles exactly the problems in stadiums.
The Chorus Duce-Duce and the arm stretched during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime.
The thoughts of Domenico Mazzilli, who, as of last week, is the Director of the Viminale Observatory (he achieved the position initially held by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously Mazzilli was head of the police administration in Trieste, where there is a nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002.
The fact is that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to chant hymns to the Duke but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 fans has been disgraceful.
- I am not a sociologist - the crime should be imputed in the country where the incident occurs.
The group has remained within the line, now we will see what has actually happened and evaluate it for future reference.
Then let us talk about the whistling to the Mameli anthem: it is not a crime in Bulgaria, but if I can say it is not good manners ...
