28-Year-Old Cook Found Dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairs of a local shopping center.
The victim’s brother stated that he can’t imagine anyone trying to hurt him, “Finally, he got up again.”
The body found on Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco forensic department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had taken his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and destroyed on the ground” about his death.
"We're a small team that works like a close family and we'll miss him painfully," the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank originally lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine anyone trying to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always cooking us something, preparing us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"By all that goes wrong in the world, he was that unshaken diamond that shone bright every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's emergency telephone at the number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I’m always in box
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
This was clearly stated by the Hollywood star in an interview.
“I’m always stuck in boxes or getting labeled from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality.”
“I don’t always want to be perfect and successful.”
“Honestly, I think these things are pretty bad for me.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at being regarded as “Miss Perfect,” as she explains in the current “Cosmopolitan.”
The actress loves to spend her time at home, in front of television with loose snacks and Mexican food, the magazine says.
“We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” said the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is Not a Child's Game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is overwhelming.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some of his colleagues sought some variation with a beach trip.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: “Golden Sports Pyramid” for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday evening, chasing home to the feed trays in a fast galop.
One mile at that speed, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” says Langer.
Then the horse career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany’s best golfer of all time – 101 tournament victories – was back close to horses.
He was led with his family through the ALRV plant, on a horse he did not even swing for photo purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed the man from Anhausen the Golden Sport Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour Player of the Year
Even the British queen has embraced him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen, he met first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sports achievements, but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.
He also received the prize of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was included in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Excellent athletes include Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Gienger, Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, Judoka Frank Wieneke, spring rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had arrived in Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton underlie a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, Trump says.
He will push down regulations massively, and he is strongly in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to accomplish, it has opportunities to disadvantaged people and needs money to do so.
Therefore, taxes would be raised for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
It needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost equally.
The Democratic candidate has announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are severely rejected by the Republican Teaparty wing, for example.
Thus, there could still be internal discussions on Trump.
The differences between energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program, calling for “a country to become the clean energy superpower and create millions of jobs.”
“It will probably be China, Germany or America – I want us to be.”
Not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in terms of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
The TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, will not be signed.
At the same time, they do not want to isolate the United States from international trade – they simply want to better protect American jobs.
They should also be paid better, for example, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says the minimum wage must be raised, then he says it should not be changed.
However, the major discussion in the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics argue that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution.
Flight: “Every refugee woman has experienced sexual violence”
Sexual violence is almost everyday for women who escape alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house is a refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby who is at least one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arm.
He stared curiously into the room.
His mother stared at the table.
Until she realizes that she is being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little boy.
The scene is normal.
Talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the chief executive of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and is engaged, among other things, in the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in northern Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single refugees and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It’s not an exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her flight,” Bahr said.
“Men are fleeing wars because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families are sending them to Europe as bearers of hope,” she says.
In women, other reasons for fleeing prevail: "Many steal themselves secretly from it because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, coercion, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her on.
This continues on the escape.
“That traffickers demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example, is not uncommon,” says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever thinks that the end, once they arrive in Germany, is foolish, says Bahr.
Even here, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused in the worst case.
This leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in northern Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
“Some of the children are not born voluntarily.”
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
“Or they don’t dare to talk openly about what they’ve experienced because the shame is too great.”
Since they often do not know how to help each other, more accommodation is needed just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked whether they would know of a similar project in their area of competence, some responded with no.
In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.
Even in Swabia, women refugees are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a government spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, the lower and middle regions, there are floors or private houses for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says, “It is very important that men and women are hosted separately.”
“If there is no privacy or if men and women are housed together, there can be – persistent – violence against women.”
Especially the laundry rooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, the study states.
How much women feel this need for protection can be read from the impact that there is on the house in Munich.
"Since it has been said around that we are there, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: demands for new labour struggle measures
Deputies of the assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new labour struggle measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more labor-fighting measures from early September.
The JDC said that ministers failed to address concerns about the treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government would have remained "hardenly quiet" about issues, leading to the deal being rejected.
"In view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has voted to reject the proposed new contract entirely and has called for formal renegotiations to address all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board of Directors today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labor struggle measures that will begin in early September.
The disputes resulted in assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms that had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place even before the vote by 54,000 doctors and medical students, that the agreement was advantageous and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forced into force.
Russia and Turkey: an “Alliance of Foreigners”?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to lay hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can’t help with the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restraint.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "loveful friend" Putin - according to one report, five times.
I could no longer count.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their previous level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a sustained coolness emitted by Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin blamed and accused Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The crime was even greater because it was committed by a presumed friend.
Restoring trust will become difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia had a sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after almost being removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard – in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They are counting on a late-season invasion of the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as it sees its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.
Additionally, the ongoing resentment over the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin – who is keen to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey’s relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is obvious to Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regime change.
The summit in this glossy palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent, as one analyst once described to me, an “alliance of outsiders”: two countries that are separated from the West and feel badly treated and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after three hours of initial talks, the two presidents declared at the press conference that they had not even addressed the issue.
The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator for Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
According to the bank’s chief executive, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and listing will move to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more significance – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand our employees will be employed under as we now become more a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will represent something entirely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we’ve asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of change.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3000th profit at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprayes champagne for a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, “It’s something special.”
I’m very emotional because my family is here too.
I’m very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It’s not a big meeting, it’s not Royal Ascot – it’s a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori takes the joy as he wins on Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best Jockey of Modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached that milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic about the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already earned 6,000 winnings if he wasn’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he is an incredible Jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glory Seven" in 1996 at Ascot, but he also survived an airplane crash and was banned from drugs.
Three years ago, he initially had trouble returning from his six-month shutdown, but he showed impressive character strength to challenge his doubters and return to his best shape.
And it’s not far from the end – Dettori has previously said he wants to continue competing until he’s at least 50.
Putin fired Russian Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov has been part of Putin’s closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In a statement, the Kremlin said that Putin, without giving any reasons, “ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration.”
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin’s website it is stated (in Russian) that he was later chief of protocol and chief of staff of government personnel.
On his appointment, he told Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the government is to support your activity as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his resignation and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This move has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest friends and, like him, he works for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television, the two men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, here few are convinced of it - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows this at the moment.
But the official claim — that a man once acclaimed as a potential president would suddenly want to lead Russian environmental policy — struck great skepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said, “It’s true that in a conversation in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated – one could almost say – difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) to replace the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he most trusted.
Once it was thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, because a third term of Putin's term would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical clash last month at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
There were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to be released at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heart in it for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but this will no longer be possible.
I just want to thank the authors, the producers, the actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The scheduled broadcast of the 12th season is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish, which appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sandals spit out of a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the show on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge Now Connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blasts" that are approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the countryside to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Cross.
We are all witnessing an engineering of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
Overall, almost 79 percent of the entire bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the lock represents future-oriented high and low construction.
After installing the last section of the roadside and connecting it to the northern tower deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the northern or rural side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern Zubringerbrücke 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Sensitive, as the tolerances the team was working on were tiny – on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown out of their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Station sounded alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had trouble swimming safely as their boat moved on its own.
"We saw the boat turning around near them and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, head of Moelfre's rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we let it go," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging on a bow without a lifeguard.
They all boarded the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, “The three men who were thrown into the water are fortunate to be alive and not hurt.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop station, it disconnected itself from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was centered.
Someone watched these men today.
Seriously Injured, Man Strikes His Ex-Friend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and wounded her seriously.
As police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator tore the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he struck her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old ruined his ex-boyfriend’s clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her life mate, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
She could not force him to leave the apartment.
So she left the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man’s ex-husband.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig’s cheap houses?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken much more in charge in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 affordable apartments in the coming years?
The SPD is proposing a “Housing Action Concept” for the next meeting of the Council.
The dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who is going to build the cheap houses?
There is a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann said: “We agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must in the future register 20 percent of all houses as social housing.”
However, the favourable housing can also be created in stock.
The big point of dispute in the city hall, however, says Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of the housing as social housing on such areas.”
A new urban housing support program, which will cost millions and still need to be funded, is to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the factions at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
They want tougher requirements for investors.
Despite this, according to Bratmann, there is a worsening of the situation in the housing market.
If the action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More personnel is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
However, the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new homes, which should be built anyway.
But how can we compensate for the loss of around 1,300 more affordable homes, the support of which will expire in the coming years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
To prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expired bonds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would be necessary to consider bringing houses back into the price binding.
This is possible in the West.
One blow would solve the problem.
At the end of the year, deadlines expire.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back there in the price binding for cheap apartments.
This is not the case for the owners, but the housing companies.
Because the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, you are moving away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of social weak people in a few districts.
The Greens expect there will be movement in the debate.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke said: “For a broad majority, the CDU must join the boat.”
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family houses.
However, this does not mean that a compromise cannot be reached.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the couch and getting more active.
Time at the screen was initially limited to television, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not rule out each other.
Of course, I’m referring to the Pokémon Go Wheel, an app based on the characters originally created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, game cards, and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest fell slightly before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones looking for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be “photographed” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “captured”.
A generation who played the game when they were even younger joined the madness and jumped for the search of the couch.
In the U.S., the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps the “average” person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently to the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of tracking people who exercise 30 minutes every day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go – it just sees the raw data for performance improvement.
Many public health education campaigns seeking to get people to “take 30 minutes of time,” “come out of the couch” and “be active every day” have stumbled on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
The importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt.
As always, there are also dumb game-destroyers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What is it?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn’t give us a reason to play sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthier.

Simone Biles makes gold in the Damenturm
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Easy on the balcony.
Amazing on the floor.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And finally the Olympics.
The 19-year-old American tournament star climbed to the multi-match title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone’s eyes under the flashlight of the Olympics.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles turns on the swing bar during the women's single multi-fighting final in art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-combat title and the fifth overall as she consolidates her reputation for being the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who has brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport over the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals – including 10 gold medals – with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her being “the best tournant I’ve ever seen.”
It expected her a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn’t go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of overdimensional expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be seen as a disappointment.
Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver each in the women's single multiplayer final in art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an outcry at the farewell ceremony of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not really true.
Some of their ground exercises—including their typical tumbling pass—are tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman was training, became forceful.
She hasn’t lost a multi-fighting competition since the summer of 2013, a series of wins that will last as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina led through two turns easily, the picture was misleading.
Swing bars and ground towers - in which Biles holds the world championship title - loud.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the swing bar - and put another one on it with 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently embraced them as they anticipated their final outcome – a pure formality – and tears flowed on Biles glossy red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raismans performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for third place, but the bronze medal in a tie-break went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, called "Oma" by the Americans, had an edge.
After her ground exercise, she threw kissing hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-old from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims killed in serial murder while listening to music in car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case while chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report reads.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 held by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more wounded in nine attacks in four months, mostly in Hispanic residential districts.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of a house,” Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis’ daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also released a police report on the shooting, targeting an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, and assuming it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridges and seized a bullet from the seat, as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-Year-Old Boy With Microcephaly: "It's Getting Better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can’t do that.
I cannot do that.
I did not allow myself to intervene.
What is not true at all – of course, you have been involved,” she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing it.
"My first response to it was 'I didn't know people still do that,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could neither sit nor scratch until he was three years old, and he still cannot speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk and cycle with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "Please sing me something."
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says.Edmund invented some characters on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I was constantly asking what would happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn’t really know.
I haven’t asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It will be better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened large-scale floods following extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa community alone would have requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service said an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in the area.
A flood early warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to hit record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban area near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger as it will slowly flow into Lake Maurepas through the treated rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams are still pulling people out of the floodwater in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepmother who lives nearby had warned him.
“We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in,” Hansford said.
It reached my height.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a rise of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and that he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the nearest fire department in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spread rapidly" as heavy rains continued and that authorities are considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been substantially filled by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road floods caused residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school cuts in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL that an adjunct in Tangipahoa 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated from two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
Local governor Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that were washed by the flood.
Emergency shelters were established in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuated.
“As soon as the water begins to drop, they will be able to go back to their homes,” he said.
In the city of Hammond, Tangipahoa, two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided for residents to take with them, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses were flooded on Thursday, but none have been on Friday so far.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6 years old, 'thrown by bullets', survives fire in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old boy has been shot.
The boy’s grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the lumbar, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transportation to the hospital.
"He's gone through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I simply cannot believe it.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy’s family told the broadcaster that he is expected to recover.
He should have started his first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people killed in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the broadcaster.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrator.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridges for storm rifles traced back to various storm rifles overlooked the scene of the crime.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were hülsen.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here, who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and police are currently reporting to check the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was struck by a cross-strike in her arm as she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine under the women’s Olympic team at the tournament, and for more than one reason.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnastes, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many young girls of different skin colors.
The structure of this team, rounding Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has consolidated the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female tournament winner has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual women's multi-fighting event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the peak of this sport, but that’s not how gym classes across the country look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four female tournaments in the team.
But the reality seems to be that gymnastics is a expensive sport and gymnastics is mainly in private gymnastics clubsined by parents who charge for training, facilities, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnastics and families).
Most of these gyms are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the tourists receive all their training and this is a costly and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started tournament.
We need to enable communities and countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have more powerful and accessible gymnastics.
I founded my touring foundation for 20 years.
At my events, we provided free and affordable tournaments in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as academic and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic Team Gold and thank you for bringing so many young girls from different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts’s proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 nurses who voted at an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract and said the NHS was in a “none country” and any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first nurse doctors are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at uncomfortable hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistant Physicians, said in a statement last night, “Assistant Physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will escalate the current workforce crisis and prevent it from treating all doctors fairly.”
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time is running out.
BMA’s efforts to resolve the disputes through talks encountered reluctance from the government to participate and sometimes anxious silence.
That came from a promise Jeremy Hunt made only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the coercion and address the worries of the nurse doctors."
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike in late April saw a postponement of 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors that will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, general director of NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said, “Labor struggle measures do nothing of the little, but burden already overwhelmed teams and service providers, and provide patients, caregivers and their families with only worry, need and interruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other key topics—such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a job break, training boxes, mutual recognition of curriculum, training leave, and gender pay gap in medicine—were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health were to comply with agreements with the BMA in November, February, and May.
The £2 per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after authorities have recommended giving it to more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the arterial walls that form plaques.
When the coating breaks down, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making blood clots less likely to form.
The NICE guidance draft, released today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a recurring heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information about the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness Is Boosting Electoral Fraud in Muslim Areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being deliberately ignored in Muslim communities as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers and councillors for ignoring evidence of election abuse on the basis of “ethnic and religious over-sensitivities.”
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now a anti-corruption king, said intimidation of voters on religious grounds would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up barricades outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry a passport to prove their identity at elections.
For now, voters only have to give their name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink on a person’s finger when they vote to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but also aims to protect the municipal government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street following the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the current mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either questionable or the result of an imitation in which one person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed a particular alarm about the fraudulent letter election – in which elderly members of the Muslim community pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including holding IDs to prove identity
His report states: “As evidence, there has been pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially communities of Pakistani or Bangladesh background.
“There were concerns that ... government institutions would have deliberately ignored such behavior due to “politically correct” hypersensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing mail election documents to stop “electricians.”
The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for harsher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before voting.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they have cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic mailing.
It prohibits political activists from editing complete mail elections and envelopes of mail elections.
Give the police the authority to set up blockades around polling stations.
A legislative amendment that facilitates the prosecution of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photographs in polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling station alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, according to the high standards of criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective “abbat controls” of the council’s electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s Tower Hamlets judgment was a warning signal.
Our country carries a proud legacy as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy After Kates Cyclist Double Walker And Other Famous Double Walkers From Rio Olympic Athletes
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been out of touch this week over the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be the impressive duo of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympionikin is far from the only gold-fighting athlete to have her own famous double runner this summer – at least not if you can trust social media.
In honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. team member in arch shooting Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
In addition to Kate’s double rider on the bike track, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. team member in arch shooting Brady Ellison has caused a twist on Twitter after images appeared in which he looks horribly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted he’s been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself don't see much similarity, except for the hair of the face," Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a nice guy, so I’ll take that as a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly go even further into the spotlight this year: the striking resemblance between British far-hopping Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament star Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes will be able to pass through as a double runner for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user believes Nathan is the "athletic version" of Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just sunny skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an “athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Strong Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
One Twitter user explained her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.”
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as touring gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m swimming squad outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "goed off like a mice" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming team.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board to the CBS commentary team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went away like a mice, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming team 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn’t realize they were still on the show.”
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m swimming team for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, with many speaking to him
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment being broadcast over a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunate formulation, we’re sorry that it happened.”
CBC finally apologized over 90 times to people who responded to the comment via Twitter
Scott Russel apologizes on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald’s comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized last night to our viewers on the show and our followers on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron’s comments referred to the swimmer’s performance, not her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation.Byron does what he said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the show and tried to justify his comment by declaring that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal assault.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming team in the CBC Olympic show," he said.
“I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not her as a person.”
Of course, there was no intentional disregard and I am very sorry.”
Buyer in Primark outraged about woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underwear.
To make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.
She went on and tried four pairs of underwear at a store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before putting it back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried the underwear, "she dressed up again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, “People couldn’t believe what they saw.”
Standing in the middle of the marketplace, she picked up a pair of underwear from the store, pulled off her own socks and pants, and tasted them.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, frightened like Oskar."
“Everyone stared as she took off her underwear, which she obviously didn’t like when she put it back on the shelf.”
She repeated the same with three other underwear before finally deciding that she didn’t like it, dressed up again and went out.
"She didn't seem to bother being watched by anyone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underwear she'd tried."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underwear home that another person wore and that was not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, “As I found out, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went — which is just as good.”
"I would hate going home with a new pair of underwear and finding out that another woman was wearing them and pulling out again and they weren't washed."
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."
All products in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from weapons with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Whether you are approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the spit for your robber.
If one approaches you from behind, then you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and “go out of the shot line,” says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the waist and twist the gun out of his hands while the attacker curves from pain. hit him in the face with the run and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar – move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can’t shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of his handle before moving backwards and targeting the gun on him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.
But remember that in a robbery, it’s safest to hand over your money – unless you’re a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright squeezes his tongue for a guide in the dirtyest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and debris reflex – by dropping some of Europe’s dirtyest and most disgusting places.
Presentator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, swaddled his trail on a euro bill, a lander at the Piccadilly Circus, a wash button in a train toilet, and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before spotting each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to engage in.
But the experiment, filmed under the title “The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength,” brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of draining the wash button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be totally repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen wash.
On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he spilled left more than a bad after-taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public grounds in railway stations to washing buttons in toilets, the task definitely put his immune system to the test
In the film, he said, “As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, soil, worms and mud water.”
In the film, he earned his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample patch showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of newly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one in less than 60.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, “This comes close to the worst thing I’ve smelled in a toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty than that.
I’m not going to paint anything here because it’s disgusting inside.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Venice Senior President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We performed crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, “Let’s call Ian.”
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Rather than just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I told him to lick, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lure her and others where it was pretty difficult.
I’m glad that we’ve taken some of those dirty delicacies on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria especially with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they used at least occasionally products that contained attached lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroyed Before Delegating Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left their social home after being relocated with £50,000 in damages for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out of their estate in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed folded holes, wooden works were ripped, garbage was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was lubricated onto the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don’t have to live that way.
There are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is too.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball beats, intimidating neighbors, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrelling and curse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order in June for anti-social behavior.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage has been found
In the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden works were ripped
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcefully relegated her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended 11-week period to voluntarily withdraw.
The deployments were applauded by relieved neighbors who said their lives were turned into hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about anyone.”
We lived with them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we say to the police here are incredible.
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.”
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!
Now that you are finally gone, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, neighbourhood enforcement manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family would have failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down.
He added, “It’s a shame that the tenant failed to take any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a relocation is always the last step Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will comfort some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deployment
House administration workers will now have to clear the garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.
Skeldon was fined after acknowledging guilty of possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will relocate tenants who do not adhere to the House Rules
Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall said the deployment was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not adhere to the rules.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusation, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a low-lying military jet flew over the beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force made an incredible crash
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military aircraft flying almost tangible close over the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By on social media, said: “It really flew by very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing.”
Nuno Arroja added, “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me.”
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but the Air Force insisted that security was not at any time endangered.
This summer, fire has devastated parts of the Portuguese mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limited his sight.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Barca worried about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight on Sunday for the first step towards the first title winning in the new football season.
The Catalans will face FC Sevilla in the duel for the Spanish Supercup outside, the retreat rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must renounce Neymar in a power match with the inferior cup finalist and ruling Europa League champion, among others, who disputes the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
The goal is Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
The German suffered a banding in the knee during training, which clarifies the entry question with Barca at least for now in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for the status of number one for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far given up on a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but for this Ter Stegen in most other applications the lead.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4
Even at the 3:2 in the trial against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Sevilla, in turn, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in its own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "titel defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday (12,5,4,4).
Thus, the world-ranking first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and even Olympics.
Bronze was won by Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two players managed to reach the final as expected and won the title against each other.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic staircase was former SVS-NÖ legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between sets and time-outs, they had no coaches with them.
They had withdrawn to the tribune and left their defenders alone in a fair competition.
"The matches so far I played for my country.
“In the final I will play for myself,” Zhang said consistently.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral.
Ma had to really fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he determined the pace on the record and left Zhang out of there only a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were a lot of stunning ball changes.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-finals against the German European champion Dmitry Ovtcharov, was in medical treatment afterwards, had to settle "ultimately" with sheet.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had, by the way, become Olympic fourth in a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump Admits ‘Great Problems’ in Election Campaign
The US Republican leadership is plagued by massive concerns about losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former republican high fortress of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually generous and self-confident multi-millionaire expressed something like concern, as correspondents.
After throwing out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida and Virginia.
Guilty of false reports about his candidacy, he again took up his well-known media cover.
Republican high castles
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were equal.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s rise again: “Just as I have done so far.”
And pushed behind: “This will either be successful, or I’ll have a very nice, long vacation.”
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is okay, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party allegedly threatened Trump to remove funds to support his election campaign if he could not present better poll figures.
Instead, they want to take the Republican candidates for Congress stronger under their arms.
Olympia: Scam in doping tests
The IOC has set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya's athlete is threatening discomfort after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Following a fraudulent attempt at a doping check in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee called for the establishment of a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official said that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to attempt its own investigation, an IAAF spokesman said.
“Depending on the findings of the investigation and the IOC’s subsequent action, the IAAF will conduct an assessment,” it said in a statement.
“He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, passed the test and signed it,” said Stephan Arap Soi, Kenya’s head of mission.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, which was on the list for training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich won the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special surveillance at the IOC after numerous doping offences for a long time.
In the announcement of the more than 2,000 targeted doping checks imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusual to point out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted in particular.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping measures are compliant with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a big runner nation.
The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, accusations have repeatedly been raised that in Kenya doping drugs are easily accessible and there is a considerable mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It was demonstrated that doping was widely and systematically used in this sport.
Russian athletes were banned from the Summer Games.
West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare’s Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the “West Side Story” with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
It was a surprise for Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classics and fulfilled her youthful dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral grave the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he whispers.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their rhythm and melody.
It’s a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony with sadness, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically exceptional.
And then there would be Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song: “I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright.”
So she is clever, of course naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an incredibly generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Leadership is a necessity for him.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip W. McKinley, “West Side Story” is very current: “This play is about prejudice and fanaticism.”
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Rican went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as important today as they were then.
Fifty-five years later, the story is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS,ly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was suspected to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's main plant in the country, ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good thing is in it—as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone—to keep people from ever making that decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane toward Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain candidate for Supreme Court in case of election victory with Garland
Harry Reid, Democratic leader in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, being lackeys and assistants of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is inappropriate for the presidency.
Treats wants naked calendar for “women and men”
The Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to produce a Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old school playboys because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar does too.
"We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nakedness, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by those images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release released by the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass evacuation
“Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-related foundation Dialogue and World.
The Kurdish community in Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be “a few hundred thousand,” believes the federation chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh approach of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass escape to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey to come to Germany if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition,” said Ali Toprak, the chairman of the association.
Because the government already overwhelmed Kurdish fortresses with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey.
After the defeated coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be repressed in Turkey.
“It can’t be that a country that welcomes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The leader complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also Alevian cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
“They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years,” said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
He called for the German government to “position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters.”
There is also a "witch hunt" against Erdogan's critics in Germany.
For the first time in the last few months, I have not felt safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, mainly Kurds and opposition.
The fire marking as a Gülen support destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed bags, by the way, the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs, even before the coup, the Turks represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany.
As of June 30, this amounted to 11,386 people, which is almost 29 percent of all those recognized as eligible for asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those fleeing war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Asylum entitled according to the Basic Law are persecuted exclusively politically, i.e. by the state.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: “Go where it hurts”
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the parliamentary elections will not be held immediately at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it can not be duller than before: summer holidays, heat and country election campaign - that bites.
The locals who are supposed to be persuaded by the voters are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers who hang posters, blow up airballs, distribute flyers and eventually count votes are hard to push up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the election campaign just by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It becomes exciting to see how strongly the AfD cut off and what remains coalition-suitable at the end.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is running an almost undetectable campaign, one can see from his big posters.
He travels around the country, distributes roses and chats a little with people, just as his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff, did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the flourishing AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "We can do that" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to run an election campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to big rallies; Merkel's Bundestag electoral district is in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons there than Mecklenburgers and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, CDU secretary general in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently complained in the NDR.
But it’s not bad for anyone else in Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the northeastern CDU largely waives the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and air balloons.
This, Kokert says, only plays a “subordinate role.”
The Union has also noticed that its base is crushing away in the country, that it has to make a lot of effort to find a thread to the people again.
They are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly anywhere in the country.
The advice of CDU voter Kokert to his colleagues, however, is also self-disclosing: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: villages, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to conduct a dedicated election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were lastly behind their partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and only slightly ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag.
They make the holiday note a modern virtue and broadcast their election campaign largely on the Internet.
“Online election campaign,” says state president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners go in search of local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving through the Mecklenburg lakes with a house boat and still finds it beautiful.
Their impression: "Voting vacation in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."
B27 Restoration: Restaurants suffer from closure
The speed with which the B27 is being repaired is not to be disturbed.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5:30 a.m. and ends only around 8:00 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
“They’ve done it all pretty badly,” says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south as planned at the beginning of the week in the middle of the week, and by the end of October everything should be ready.
The responsibility of those responsible for the construction works is also praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of shelter entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
Citizens can now drive on both sides from Ofterdingen from the B27.
Traffic through the area seems to be declining.
“There were some significant complaints there,” said Florian King, deputy chief executive responsible for the repair’s traffic management.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise because many were looking for slopes and trusted their ship rather than the signage.
This caused some trucks to crash into residential areas.
As the speed limits were not respected, the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
“There were significant excesses,” says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There are two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was 77 km/h in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the building was completed, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen do not like to look at the cards.
But that the B27 renovation has led to revenue cuts in them leaves everyone who asks a glance.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, for whom the renovation has hardly any consequences.
Also at Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of "a slight decline", but also acknowledges that of course "there is a lack of professional expertise".
The most striking are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is existential threat.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it hard.
There were customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We have to be happy with every euro.
The sales loss is estimated to be “more than 50 percent.”
The road repair has dropped its operation "for two years".
Half of his employees had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, stating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27.
Göhner knows of other districts where something like this was handled more generously.
With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his hostel will continue.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to its long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now passing by less often due to the complicated traffic management.
If you can’t get there, it’s nice elsewhere.
That his regular client will return after the end of the restoration work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that’s brutal.
Laws are constantly being shrouded in the name of counter-terrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
What does tolerance have to do with terrorism?
What does the coalition partner say about this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are “politically reasonable” for the coalition partner, the German interior minister said in the presentation of his new security package.
You do not exaggerate anyone.
Other issues will first be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in this.
As the interior minister, however, he relied on results and on a “realisable consensus” within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has taken some time before presenting his conclusions on security in the republic.
However, these are now even more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, instigated: That a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communications is not new.
Also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second run for proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to cut off German passports from jihadists with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chances anyway.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have it in part: he plans to speed up procedures for deportations and more ways to detain people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted in the country should first have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
When it comes to the tolerance of refused asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than before – such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things seem unresolved and leave questions open.
And at some points – in the case of the inequality of treatment of the tolerant, for example – the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be denied that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be clogged out even during election campaigns.
Internal security is highly focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
The attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The EU and the SPD are increasingly engaged in the issue of internal security.
In recent days, there has been a high tension between the two parties.
First a hefty dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security-political collection of ideas by some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of departments also demand a burka ban and an abolition of dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for reconciling sounds here.
He has no intention of leaving the double pass.
We have settled the debate in Germany.
Reopening it doesn’t make sense.
And with a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually “reasonable” for the coalition partner is yet to be shown.
There is a lot in it that could cause a dispute.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
The leader of the SPD, Sigmar Gabriel, said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help to further increase security.”
Volkswagen is still going through.
Despite the diesel scandal, shipments worldwide are on the rise.
However, it does not work in all markets.
When it comes to recall, there is a whirlwind about a concept.
Volkswagen will start more productively in the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in the previous year despite the diesel deal thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened, mainly in Western Europe, and thereby again burdened the overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 449,100 cars in July, 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than the previous month.
In the German domestic market, deliveries dropped by almost a sixth.
Jürgen Stackmann, chief sales officer, reduced the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a retention in buying in some core markets due to "changing economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also stressed, a spokeswoman explained.
In the United States, where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a downturn.
The main support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony is still glimpsing through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is booked.
Fred Kappler, chief sales officer, continued to show sales growth from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in that period, worldwide 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with software.
In Germany alone, VW is recalling around 2.5 million cars for re-equipment.
In the course of the refurbishment, VW reaffirmed that the refurbishment of the cars has no negative effects.
After re-equipping the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer will issue a “warranty-like” certificate to customers after the refurbishment, but does not speak of a “warranty”, as it was called on Friday in business circles.
The reason is legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had that Volkswagen would now give its German customers a guarantee for re-equipped diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that the meeting took place.
“VW must fully meet the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA.”
"Distractions from this will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance do not deteriorate after re-equipment and that all vehicle type-approval values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term “guarantee” as it was called in business circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, a half year after the re-equipment, come to a workshop with a engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Also in the interests of customers, it is important to avoid that any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal lead to uncertainty regarding possible warranty arrangements, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term “guarantee”.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding penalty interest from rich savers in the future - as the second institution in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on tour or day cash accounts."
The Federal Federation of German Banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: normal savers should "not be afraid to pay penalty interest for their savings."
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they will have to pay a fine of 0.4 percent.
This fee will be recovered by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on turnover or daily cash accounts.
The first 100,000 euros are free.
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
He has been holding for some time 40 million euros, which could be withdrawn from day to day and which he could not use.
“They are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the cost,” the bank’s chief said.
“I can’t pay for every million euros.”
The cost is based on the polluter principle.
Just leaving the cash in the treasures of Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: “I’ve already experienced four robberies, I don’t want the fifth!”
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few of them moved to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Federation stated: “The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs to all banks.”
To carry them alone is "business-economically permanently impossible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account keeping, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest on deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land with its Skatbank branch had made headlines in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the banking association, said: “We do not expect private customers to have to pay widespread fees for deposits, in addition, the competition in Germany among banks and savings funds is much too strong.”
A banker said that at Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is somewhat more richly equipped with wealth."
"That can be a problem for a small bank" if it stores money for free.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region reside well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The co-operative association of Bavaria "is currently unknown to any other banks that charge a reimbursement rate for deposits of private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, president of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), stated: “The threshold to go negatively towards the private customer is very, very high.”
The competition is tough, and it threatens investors to move away from the competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this.
Destination discs: who actually buys sound discs?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to sow it under the nickname NotAllSelfSelfSelf with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of recordings is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobby collectors – it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and wildly styling before I stand, holding my hands and saying something definite like, “So, let’s take a closer look at it.”
So, let’s take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm – hotels, restaurants, and offices are now filling the buildings that once housed independent sellers – there are still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am standing close to different men in such shops and trying to estimate their age and mind by observation.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably around the 20s), is a day in London for a meeting and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector?
“I appreciate it,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These recordings, depicted above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn’t follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy items he sold when he was young and broken.
“Many of the things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, that appeared when I was 11 or 12.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my cargo.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media jump, people who have heard about the comeback and are motivated to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I’ve been conducting, people have usually left their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy them again,” he says.
That would explain the boom in supporters of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think that is the case with many people.
It is an easy way to engage mentally.
“We’re like your social workers!” a worker whispered from a record stack.
An ICM survey in April revealed that 50% of people who bought a record last month have not listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I browse through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophiest aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More productive, less musical.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a record player.”
These are younger people, not older people, who are only slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colourful audience as I enter.
There are couples around the 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drills out of the speakers – it’s good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look lonely, but chewing psychological trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes looking at the variety of plates on sale.
It’s more like a big shop than a big shop.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting plates isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of records is...” she drives away with a loving sufferer.
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
As I seem to pattern the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them—maybe because they’re purely decorative, some so far above that it’s impossible to touch them.
It is pure “plate art.”
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that one population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research found that YouGov’s findings are correct, at least in record stores in Soho, they ignore the large number of female collection lovers that exist in real life, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They won’t spend their Thursday tomorrow wandering through Berwick Street record stores and leafing through records while avoiding the stirring gaze of a terrible, 30-year-old false moderator who raises over the shoulders of nonsensical middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video review
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines sharks, says the record was in a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
During a trial this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be empowered to demolish 72 temporary stores where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which carries a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also concluded that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were “absolutely traceable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the downturn was the Jungle Book Kids’ Café of the camp, which is publicly operated and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as as asylum counseling for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure would be "a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge du Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 - the highest number to date - following a steep rise in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin continues to fight
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic season, professional cyclist Tony Martin does not want to let go.
"I continue to keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the Sugar Hut.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's timing," Martin said.
He must quietly analyze what causes the debacle.
At the time ride World Cup in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look closely at everything we've changed lately."
"This also counts for my position," wrote the three-time world champion, who lost more than three minutes on the 54.5 km on Wednesday to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis professional Siegemund missed the semi-finals
Laura Siegemund’s triumph ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: the 32nd World Rankings from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clear.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass her overturn once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hopeful Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the proposal round.
The winner of the Australian Open met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German professional tennis player, Tommy Haas won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games had last been there in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic semi-final.
Group Increases in Live Video Game Broadcasting Start-up
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend – and Microsoft wants to benefit from it.
The technology group is buying the startup Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money will be spent on the acquisition, Microsoft did not disclose on Thursday.
Beam launched its offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give players missions and confront enemies, as well as provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington, will move to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, California, Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi said.
For customers, there is nothing to change with the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Popular platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by Amazon in 2014 for $1 billion.
YouTube Gaming is owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet.
Here is the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s railers must adapt to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal states, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are designed to deliver speeds effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on highway construction sites or bridges to be repaired with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flash.
Permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: Its battery lasts for five days with uninterrupted measurement operation, and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measurement technology can also detect all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as transit prohibitions by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-risk state, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in measurement operation, so that the wheels in the armored and, by the way, fireproof exterior shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the flash from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested in various federal states, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: recently, France has ordered 100 units, after an order of 150 units last year.
Britain gets silver in 7th Rugby after Fiji wins Masterclass Gold
Britain’s impressive performance in 7’s rugby came to an abrupt stop in the final on Thursday evening at the final hurdle in the form of the Fiji when they were defeated with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, backwards, line running, and raw force to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal – Britain’s fourth on that day – and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boxers, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best shape in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB – but it probably won’t – that at least one British will be hanging a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind.
Eight years ago, they lost every match at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
You lost only one.
This trap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs kick off out of fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. felt like they were riding on a running bus. The World Series winners went up 5-0 as Osea Kolinisau rolled over in the corner.
With four minutes of playing time left, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he transformed.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A stunning tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reboot, and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou struck through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
So is it too.
GB made fundamental changes to the halftime, closing the Fijian gap for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant intermediate from Fiji.
Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, making a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long run in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, swung flags and danced on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-tuple with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pfiff sounded, the Fijians embraced and GB kicked devastatingly in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a short semi-finals match - Britain turning the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxing forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the positions in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning Inspired by Coach's Fight With Cancer to Ride Victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard hive entering history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
The echo of coach Robin Williams, was all-present when they rode to the second Olympic gold in a row without a taxwoman, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th unbeaten bet, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes slipping over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the kind of triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was nobody more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn’t know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that can be operated and they did.
If you do not, it will spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start their treatment in early 2014, outside of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station – 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
So it begins.
Riding in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediate victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was in a mission in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment, said, “I was an emotional wreck this week.
It just repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It’s been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so a huge thank you goes to him.
I could not have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a tough rhythm that their opponents couldn’t keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started opening up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called “stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It is really important not to get caught up.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing anything great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to score a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retired.
The association is considered “exemplary throughout Bavaria”.
A small drinking water package as a model for the large water producers.
This was stated some time ago in the original tone in a post by the Bavarian Radio.
Shortly thereafter, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken praised the purpose association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was considered “exemplary throughout Bavaria”.
Rupert Göller has worked for 31 years in the purpose association, including 28 years as Managing Director.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe, headquartered in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, funds approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 towns and villages with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn’s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired in 1985 as a water guard and was appointed as managing director of the purpose association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," she said.
As outstanding events she named the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the field of the new wells (1998) and compensation to farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the re-acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renovations of water pipelines.
There was no stall and there were constant innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Göller for his faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has devoted himself with a lot of heart blood to his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was able to present the successful concept of the Veitensteingruppe on nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a lot of praise and recognition for this.
For his part, Rupert Göller praised waterwoman Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He was the best waterkeeper and he was a loyal man.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment, however, was the pipeline breakdown at the high tank at Kirchlauter on a 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, they will have to work throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only beined once, because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with pipes.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeded Rupert Göller.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko openly deals with her son’s autism – and turns to other affected parents: “You have to have the courage to talk about it.”
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the illness was discovered in her son, she thought she had to die.
Tiago, now eight years old, has made good progress and is now studying privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: when I ask him something that goes back two years when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
He is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's association with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship situation in Bargteheide - man shoots on life mate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 in a family home in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) and wounded her deadly.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his life mate," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run and is being investigated publicly.
Meanwhile, all over Germany, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a glare.
Police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a slide.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could carry a gun with him, the police said.
Whoever sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police are talking about a “relationship state”.
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information about the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that one person was killed.
“It is a murder crime.”
"We do not say more at the moment," a police spokeswoman in Lübeck said.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operation Command (SEK) was on the scene.
Steel – the light for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains saved from additional costs in millions.
The financial burdens that threatened the industry from the promotion of eco-electricity are out of the table.
It remains in the exemption from the renewable energy burden in the stock plants for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really happy that we finally managed to this after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers who use gases from the high-speed furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to pay.
The steel industry was threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year, according to the German Industry Association.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG load of 20 percent falls.
It is also not used in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.
This largely defines the status quo of the existing regulation.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
“In view of our ‘Steel is the Future’ campaign, this is a first step.”
“Others have to follow.”
“Climate and employment targets must also be balanced in the emission trade reform,” said Jörg Hofmann, chief executive officer of IG Metall in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
The situation worsened last year as China, the world’s largest producer, massively dropped steel into the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed a little.
On the one hand, the imposition of import duties on imported steel has shown an effect, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has improved.
It is unclear how sustainable the price hike is.
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
At the end of the day, prices were stagnant again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not exclude the closure of individual factories.
At the end of 2015, about 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced 3.4 million tons of crude steel well six percent less than in the previous month, the Economic Association Steel said on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced has now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the value of the previous year.
The association expects to increase emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing Is Good for Seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching school she studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Songing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, cheerful, and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, it does something good for your health and your mind.
Because singing is, from several perspectives, a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the Deutsche Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular meetings, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve with age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also been made by Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To talk and organize, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."
Singing can be stressful in a positive sense, Hackler thinks.
For this reason, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who require their lungs regularly do not get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes toining the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On the elderly, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of Seniors Organizations.
In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observed that singing or listening to songs arouses many memories in older people, often associated with positive emotions of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia can recall long-standing events.
When singing, a special performance is also required from the head, Lenz explains.
Focusing on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm at the same time, while adapting to other singers, is a big cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not to focus only on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get by singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
Showing myself: When I practice for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond myself – that experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don’t sing alone – with 50 singing people, who can listen to it when a sound goes by?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, Hackler says.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in an elderly choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overview of the choirs in the area.
Anyone who wishes to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating – that’s true for any age.
Cats are more sensitive to cries than cats
Biologists in Hannover have studied the effect of cat babies calling on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Miauen did not leave the males cold, but they always behaved the same way unlike the females.
Female cats can detect the excitement of cat babies on the miaues of the little ones.
They respond ten percent faster to sounds from kittens who think they are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary College and the Medical College of Hannover (MHH) have found.
Cats also respond to cats’ calls, but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between miauing of less and heavily aroused young animals are either imperceptible or irrelevant to the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and tone of the kitten scream varies with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight female cats from the MHH livestock were observed.
On the one hand, they were presented with the calls of little ones, who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams from more excited kittens, who were extra lifted up.
The researchers consider their findings meaningful despite the small sample.
“All females, even those who haven’t yet had their own offspring, reacted differently to the scream,” Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when the cries of the much more excited kittens were played.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, Biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski attacked the Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, a major football match will be held in Turkey.
Before the rival duel between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual" is trendy.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July, the government insisted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt.
This is not stopped before football.
Former Starkicker Hakan Sükür has been arrested.
Accordingly, Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is believed to be a supporter of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still in place until October, it has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The night "democracy guards" in public places across the country Erdogan declared ended on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas Labour Club are traditionally not counted as friends of the president.
But what the majority of Turks unite in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coupons.
Even the fans agree, regardless of whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
The winner of the “Gala” will be Lukas Podolski.
His sporting value was demonstrated by the Cologne in the past season: With 17 goals and nine goals in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the club’s top scorer.
In the final game against Fenerbahce he scored the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He finished the season well and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season found a reconciling ending for the record champion.
After the preliminary K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also ran out early in the Europa League.
In the Super League, it was only enough to rank six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
“We did that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Masters Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season encounters as the Super League goalkeeper king.
This is also why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old’s return.
At the same time, the contract with AC Florence and only borrowed to Besiktas after the coup attempt, Gomez had announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his EM vacation.
“If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it,” said Fikret Orman, the club’s chief executive.
For this, however, the attacker would have to be prepared to give up about one-third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite doping, these athletes still have chances to win medals at Rio Olympics
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other persuaded athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The issue of doping is still in the headlines of the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had complained about her right to start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was grabbed and exhausted at her start (100 meters of chest).
There was a curious scene: with a smiling smile she was still proudly in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it became clear that she was not going to pick up gold, the audience burst into a storm of joy.
However, there are still many other athletes who are going to start the Rio Olympics despite a doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m season/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has been suspended for doping twice (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before, he is the world's number one over 100 meters in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month ban in 2010 after she was shown to take the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe tooth pain after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discussions/Croatia): 2011 Olympic winner of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion of 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the conscious intake and was imprisoned for six months.
The four longest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favourite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m squad/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positive in 2010 and was blocked for 21 months.
A means for penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt argued.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 meters is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerworf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has been deprived of so many medals subsequently.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after being diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old was also forced to surrender Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the EM title in 2006 for testosterone abuse.
He was also stripped of the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympics following a ruling by the International Court of Sport (CAS).
At 80.4 meters, it is ranked second in the world ranking.
Liu Hong (20 km Walk, China): The world record-breaker and gold favorite was only tested positive in May, but can still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a prohibited dietary supplement, the World Anti-Doping Agency’s ban fell mildly and lasted as early as July 13.
Bombing in Thailand: Austrian woman injured, several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, but has already been able to leave.
Her trip home was scheduled for early September.
Whether Austrian citizens were also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard.
In Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs were first detonated in a fireplace on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Two more explosions occurred on Friday morning and another person was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was in Phuket this morning.
In the detonation near the popular beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured, according to police.
In Surat Thani, on the southeastern coast of the country, another bomb then exploded, killing a city employee.
The explosive device went into the air in a flower bed outside the coastal police area, according to the authorities.
Lastly, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and Chumphon on the southeast coast left several injured.
It is believed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombing attacks carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
“We assume it is a coordinated attack.”
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police said the attacks were not linked to Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities had received intelligence reports in recent days about upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but were not informed about the exact time and places.
It is unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement districts.
There are small bomb attacks in Thailand, but they are not usually targeted at tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to strictly follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary trips to these provinces are advised.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will also give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military junta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody riots, claims to be beneficial in bringing the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to cope with the uprising of Muslim rebels, which has been raging in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing “Identitäre Bewegung” has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, constitutional defenders in the Bund also put the group under surveillance.
“We see in the ‘Identitären Bewegung’ signs of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order,” said the head of constitutional protection Hans-Georg Maaßen to the German news agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in extremist ways.
We are also observing the movement.
The “Identitäre Bewegung” is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes “multiculturalism”, “uncontrolled mass immigration” and “the loss of one’s identity through alienation”.
Constitutional defenders in nine federal states – Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NDR, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thüringen – are already watching the “Identitaries.”
Maaßen said his authority coordinated closely with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," he said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-friendly language, often with pop girl music.
Islamists and right-wing extremists do so.
This is not a good advertisement for your own business.
Propaganda is meant to address people emotionally.
Young people are especially vulnerable.
That is dangerous.
Recently, there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the “identitaries” with AfD politicians.
Maßen said he has no knowledge of this.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party – in this case the AfD – changes its direction by certain people who are extremist and thus becomes extremist.
It is therefore decisive whether such persons have controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
Given the significant increase in law-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not talk about new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group ‘Old School Society’ or the Freitaler group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming that plan attacks on asylum-seekers, on refugee homes or other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or European-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or on social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
“So many people have committed crimes who previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or have voted for CDU, SPD or left, for example, who have then radicalized through right-wing extremist moods.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros haste becomes the internet hit
Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This is demonstrated by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight Ethiopian swimmer swam so slowly that he was temporarily out of the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended his advance with a 48-second retard and took the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted a special start right from the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros’s Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media referred to him as the “Robel of the Whale.”
In reference to a "welfare stomach", the English bulletin "The Sun" made a joke about him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he hit only with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with “Eric the Eel” have also been drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani’s run caused media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to compete alone in an advance over 100 meters freestyle.
Moussambani was fired at the time.
The 22-year-old then learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store on the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsreeder had left her store on Monday at 17.30 am, while forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8:15 p.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the box.
Traces of the perpetrator were not found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the threat of election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the US presidential election fails, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
Then he is going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, he’t care: “In the end, either it will work out, or I’ll have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the U.S. television channel CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is okay, Trump said.
He called US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founders of the Islamic State (IS).
There has been increasing resistance within his party.
Post increases in electric transportation trade
The German Post’s electric car in action.
The interest of other companies is obviously high.
The Post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The company plans to start trading the car soon.
The Post will also offer its electric vehicles on the free car market from next year.
“We want to go into the sale to third parties,” a post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been considering for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages, to other as well.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes said there were constant requests, for example, from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group intends to enter the mass production of the vehicles soon.
In its own manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group would significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and target a complete transition to eco-friendly vehicles in the long run.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we are rebuilding the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on German roads since 2014.
GfK executive resigns after disappointing business figures
Consumer research company GfK is replacing its chief executive Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes more uncertain the longer the successes he promised are missing.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company’s management, the world’s number five in the industry is facing a new personal start.
The CEO of GfK plans to leave the company by the end of the year.
Arno Mahlert, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of GfK, is leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The leadership in the board of directors will take over the current board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as of 1 September, the company said.
He will officially take on the role of a “Council Speaker” until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignation, the company cited "different views" about long-term business policy orientation.
No details were announced by a company spokesman on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is currently unclear.
Investor circles said on Friday that shareholders were most recently disappointed by the continued failure of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the head of GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not visible even after five years," it said.
Given the recent bad GfK business figures, every shareholder will get upset at some point.
"If this was the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," he said.
After declines in the previous quarters, the company was unable to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016.
With €361.2 million, sales were 6.1% below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent to EUR 721.2 million.
The profit in the second quarter was primarily burdened by the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The necessary depreciation of the company’s value of €139 million in the Consumer Experience business unit resulted in a loss of €148.2 million for the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a profit of 19.7 million.
Bus crashes into crumbling corners in Graben: eight injured
In an accident of a tourist bus with 43 seniors as passengers on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district) eight people were injured.
Two of the passengers were seriously injured, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her information, had to evade an encountered cargo, which was partly on the opposite track.
The bus dropped to the right of the street and slipped into a pit, a police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
Firefighters released the occupants.
Six ambulance vehicles and an emergency car arrived at the scene of the accident on Landstraße 2.
The uninjured passengers were brought back by a bus to the district of Pewsum.
There you should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of wastewater will be 3.44 euros for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl as of 1 October 2016 instead of 2.10 euros; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (until 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (until 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an exaggerated calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU), when the budget was approved by the council of Kulmbach, it was determined that coverage for these sewage plants was opened.
Based on legal grounds, Market Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost-covering basis.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to grasp their wallets more deeply.
The tax increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Chief Administrative Officer Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or sub-coverings from the previous calculation period will also be compensated.
Schmidt argued that all three sewage plants are relatively small plants with a very low amount of sewage, which is between 6,800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the wastewater intake in all three plants decreased slightly.
Furthermore, during the previous calculation period, all three installations incurred significant renovation and repair costs, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the 20-year-old transmission plants had to be overhauled from scratch, and in the Lopp pond cleaning plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first cleaning pond had to be removed, the cleaning sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility installed in order to be able to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: “To these extraordinary expenses came the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period.”
The same applies to electricity costs, which at the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still well below the current level.
Stone Houses made it clear that with the low amount of sewage in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance will "fullly hit".
In doing so, Schmidt added, the market community has been saved from large maintenance costs at the sewage plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the aforementioned plants will continue to be precarious in the long run, according to stone houses, especially since the supply area of the wastewater association Friesenbachtal cannot be expanded by these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation rate of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%, measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0,2%.
In July 2016, the prices of the following consumer goods groups increased compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %); transport (1,8 %); leisure and culture (6,3 %); restaurants and hotels (1,2 %); various goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices dropped for clothing and shoes (2,2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0,5%); health (0,1%).
Prices remained the same as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat criticizes “anime” effect as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it’s insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders absurdity.
You can turn into an ananas, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blurred, distorting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All mistakes come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past, accusing them that the Blackface app would promote or propagate white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed a filter this week to some users that would give them slick eyes, fake teeth, and open cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians – “yellow face.”
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: The filter was meant as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were widespread, wrote that the filter was “harmful and mildly uncomfortable.”
She added that “it’s difficult to argue with the contrast between a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-faced has been drawn to the deterrent extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people – who are more diverse in race than their older opponents – might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat’s filters generates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it was before,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, urging others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she doesn't have a diverse representation of people with different skin colours in her workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with different skin colours working there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a HR manager focusing on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said she would be leaving her Snapchat account closed and added, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, Congress committee finds
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual circumstances on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigation committee said in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, abbreviated Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence information typically retrieved by senior Centcom commanders regularly produced a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the actual circumstances on the ground would have allowed, and was consistently more positive than the analysis of other intelligence services,” a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts in training the Iraqi armed forces.
Although it does not provide direct indications that heads of government under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves under pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom family member has publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under the control of Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the heads of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the Task Force after analysts appeared to be concerned about the manipulation of reports about Islamic State.
The report, published on Thursday, will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
Additionally, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Defense Ministry’s Inspector General are underway.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," the top Democrat in the committee, House member Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, “delayed the publication of intelligence reports,” damaged the morality among analysts and “gived excessively little room for diverging opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of the White House interfering with the Centcom analysts regarding a “specific political opinion.”
The preliminary results of congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times investigations by the Pentagon’s inspector-general, which were launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on congressional reports while the inspector-general investigation is still ongoing.
But he also stated that “experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important national defense issues.”
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful U.S.-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by an increasing number of Defense Ministry officials).
But last year’s accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the classified information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the controversy of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then administration under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only planned a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government agencies, the team around Mr. Hooker found that, contrary to government statements, airstrikes against the Islamic State-owned refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
This finding, however, was not published, the Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation during a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain is ahead
One day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women’s field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that won the Americans 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she can’t remember ever doing that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I am not one of those people who keep their gates in memory.
She knows this, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British women in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will each win the first and second place.
The first-placed will go a little further away from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Whatever the match ends on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising twist through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey beak in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became the U.S. national player, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she was unable to qualify for the team.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the national team’s coach and things began to turn to the better.
“A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change,” said Bam.
We didn’t have the workload in London we have now.
We were able to turn the wheel completely around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough, holding the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and kicked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Same as Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, there are the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and inevitable, a racing race between competition and pursuit.
It’s like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod stretching from wrestler to swimmer to turner to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor talking in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is attending the Olympics for the first time and a women’s sword with dwarfs, could have been among those well-known names being broadcast to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, turner, or even fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, bowling, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I should humbly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so rarely over the last 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who did it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians the ones for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has some outward charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an enthusiastic enthusiast.
It has humorous potential – the cartoonish shake of its never-ending shock – but also the grace of turning and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "springboard."
Ascending winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air, and need a series of falling movements (turns, hikes, and salts) before landing on their feet.
They are rated according to the official Olympic program by performance, level of difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
In their quest for gold, medallion hopers have to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playing field.
Not only are they chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but in television broadcasting they are also chasing another abominable target: the world record or the Olympic record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it’s enough to even stir a viewer to tears.
But it’s also what I feel a bit tired even when watching these games.
The trampoline provides a breath break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she crashes off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It’s as Zen as competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13:00 Eastern Time; the men’s on Saturday, also at 13:00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14:00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.
If awareness-raising can only be achieved by invoking and objectivizing male athletes – as the male U.S. turner recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley is expecting his air-ringing new crowd of fans.
"A Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed in shootings during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
The government’s response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Circulating videos of the protests, presumably from last or early this year, show security personnel beating young people with sticks while they were forced to take a handshake against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights agency is now demanding a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, in Somalia.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable rate.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically – there is a new pendling train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was nothing more than a model of democracy – human rights organizations have continuously led the government’s repression – the opposition in the country has been narrowed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven to the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
“If you repress people and they have no other option but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protested.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to the grip on the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this dull, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less repressed in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and re-armed themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of boiling under the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have very many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones are becoming more and more common and Internet services are improving.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathering to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But this is also changing now.
"We are about to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublished illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was skilled at detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to handle opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this fundamental skill,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, appeared to have been spoofed by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal resentment of the Ethiopian government.
It takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara city, attacked run by Tigray, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
“This,” said Mr. Abdi, “is a very thin gray hike.”
Donald Trump says Obama’s allegation that ISIS was founded was “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by stating that his repeated claims that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terror group were not seriously meant.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also puts his colleagues, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the hint at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump roared back on the claim on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the day before, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was taking the accusation completely seriously.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know anything about it.
The latest storm of criticism is blowing down on Mr. Trump as he has tried to shift the focus of his campaign to the economy due to falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this topic.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already introduced sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he attracted strong criticism when he argued that the Russians should hack Mrs Clinton’s emails, but he later explained, “Of course I meant it sarcastically.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then roll back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are captured by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, ‘clear’ depending on how the response goes out,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.
But I also think he’s clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways.
Rather than sharpening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has taken an even more sharp tone as his poll scores have further declined.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with great advance in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he has been increasingly in the focus of attention during the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal counterparts in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments,” Mr. Giuliani said, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump’s statements that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbone, completely wrong, and that it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania election campaign on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He defamed the “poor, miserable” television experts trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”
Some of the Democrats laughed at Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once overpriced from the market, coffee comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, which did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were displaced from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, “I know New York is changing, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, except the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap business.”
But if New York is change, then it is also invention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funding for a new outpost, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, has contributed a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for which the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with speck and cheese, and there are garments such as capers and sauced onions.
There are natural trails.
The cafe no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
“Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg,” he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb was closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was on coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she’s drinking coffee again, even though she ordered a Blended Chai Tea that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same.
"I came quarter by seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he exchanges his everything bagel with speck, egg, and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no resentment that the soap business had taken over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the coffee’s cold-brushed coffee as an ingredient.
“I think we will still accept their offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to display it soon so his new neighbors will feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold-brushed coffee in a bottle.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the room and ordering a new coffee felt like going home.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The Depressive Eating of the Economic Crisis in "A Rich Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt ate his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a tasty, President Roosevelt had a flavor for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was somewhat more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purry and a plum pudding as a dessert.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe’s last book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman, in her book, “97 Orchard,” tells about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, A Decent Meal, which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, clockless snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with pieces of olives, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato purie and vegetable blend.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
“Rich foods were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe was laughing.
“It must have laid in the stomach like lead,” he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women were cooking for male field workers and fresh baked pastas were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways the country managed to deal with no longer being the shrimp country.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe began explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods like breads and casseroles became basic foods, casseroles as “a wonderful way to recycle food residues,” Tiegelman noted, as chefs could hide unhappy ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Unique mixtures were tried as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to lunch,” Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.
It was typical for many of the home recipes.
As never before or since then, household economists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 — have driven the country’s eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “household politicians” and meet the challenge of turning pommes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic delicacies.
Particularly tasty are the reports on the government’s response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumbersauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost golden dining room and wore a smoking.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn’t asked him to statue with his stomach.
As described in the book, Mrs. Roosevelt’s hiring of a housewife with no interest in flavors resulted in the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most reluctantly prepared.”
Many of the ways of dealing with food from the era of the Great Depression were discarded as soon as the land came back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
In writing the book, the couple said they better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother-in-law—for example, how she couldn’t throw away food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “She actually made people sick.”
There was the wind turbine.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe drew out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called Prune Whip,” Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss out on modest recipes for a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone sinked somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the thick, brown glimpses.
Surprisingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe got a follow-up three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he said to his wife, “A few cracked walnuts would help.”
Killed in bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has been killed in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has saved 60,000 lives so far, according to Bild.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of destroyed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the war heroes in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector showing him rescuing an 11-hour baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a bright symbolic figure in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said according to the picture: "For me, this is the real jihad."
“When I die in order to save lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the recent bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime’s deadly bomb was meant to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
A rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
The shark was allowed to return to the sea on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims at about 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, reaching an average of 1,220 meters in an hour.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to just 2.6 km/h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a barley.
However, this lifestyle characterized by slowness seems to be a pattern recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
“Crazy,” Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this lifespan, which is a world record for vertebrates.
Evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland sharks are stoning.
Only the evidence was lacking.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the Ice Sea off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in the winter.
Researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their pace of time when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
Sacrifice does these sharks do anyway: in the stomach of one animal, researchers found the remains of a frog, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young icy bear.
They may be hunting for sleeping animals or patroling at the bottom of the ice lake, looking for corpses that torch down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 outside Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters in length, while the largest was 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the shark lens nucleus using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is formed before the sharks are born, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth was therefore supposed to be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests dumped larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In contrast, in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, which is believed to have celebrated its 50th birthday when it was investigated in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed a age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502-centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.
It was known that female Greenland sharks only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now, the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals, 392 centimeters tall, was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks seem to be able to reproduce for at least one and a half centuries.
This is currently a world record for vertebrates.
That such methals live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale with a 120 year old harpun spike on its neck, was also caught outside of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on fire.
They mature later – and age more slowly.
In order to stay warm in the cold water, the animals also often become especially large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
Therefore, the heat loss of a gram of mouse is much greater than that of an elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"Therefore, a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Construction in a double pack
The issues surrounding construction have been focused on in the recent meeting of the municipal council.
With relief, the panel accepted the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that “the commercialization of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin.”
After the land, parceling and expansion issues were clarified and the applications for measurement were submitted, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - extension section 1) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau are equally attractive to young families and comfortable seniors.
As it was said, people willing to build can now report at the town hall, the award of the plots is expected to be discussed by the municipal council in its September meeting.
In order to meet requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises associated with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan, which was first drawn up in the spring of this year, in partial areas.
Thus, in the area of under-temporary larns, the already designated commercial area will be expanded by two parcels in the direction of State Street 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies relocated from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," said Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London to finance transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, it is sufficient for them to be admitted to the UK.
This is used by major US banks.
Several banks have already announced relocating jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects to create 10,000 new jobs in the mainland within five years.
Frankfurt is headquartered by the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites responsibilities for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision Authority (EIOPA) and the ESRB Risk Board.
Although the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisory authorities," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg has a large funding sector, but, like Dublin, it has a worse infrastructure performance.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city scored with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris, it’s not that easy to find free high-quality offices,” says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg is ranked 19, Dublin is ranked 33 and Paris is ranked 37.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
But London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Brexit vote, according to economists.
In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, at the end of 2015 there were around 144,000 people working in the banking sector, while in Frankfurt there were 62,500.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of legal costs incurred by it in the hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempt from paying $200 million in damages for violating two of Merck’s patents related to Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of misconduct on Merck’s part, including honeymoon and other unethical actions.
U.S. Attorney Beth Labson Freeman said at the filing of the lawsuit on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to relief of costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which is dominating the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left it, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently striking the city after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij military council, allied with the DKS, told Reuters.
“The city is now under complete control, but we are currently doing cleaning work,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned 10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which gave the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband a income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clinton donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned $5.3 million in remuneration; the former Foreign Secretary $3 million in revenue from Simon & Schuster for her book about her term in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton’s vice president candidate, Virginia senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton are publishing their tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They are on the train," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax checks have been completed.
Trump’s critics, including Republican 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already said that his refusal raises questions about his wealth, his donations to charities, his business practices, and various other ties, with Russia.
Clinton has already stumbled onto the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republicans urge Trump to publish his tax return.
She also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan on Thursday.
“He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns,” she told the crowd.
Politico has that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industry conglomerate is headquartered here, called for Trump to hold a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he has also been subjected to a tax check by the IRS and Trump is "fearful" of the voters, not the tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clinton, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40,5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that they only received $100 of their income as a salary, unlike most of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton’s dividends and revenues of $109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements – they throw condoms filled with chilipud on them.
The method has proven effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has, along with the U.S. Nature Conservation Agency, intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with them being much more confident that they can keep the elephants away from their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body in a condom, the end of which is turned up to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom breaks up with a blow and sprayes fine dust of chilipudder into the air.
A breath quite usually already out to chase the elephant.
A final possibility is a throwing machine that fires a gold rainy fireworks in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk construction on the St. Goarer Rhine
Typically, St. Goar’s investment projects are accepted by business operators with a handy hand – but it is precisely the retail in the city that is considered to be significantly expansive.
However, the request for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction was now unanimously rejected by the city council.
“In principle, we welcome new business operators, but this kiosk does not fit in this exposed location on the Rhine,” Hubrath told the CDU group.
Jewish director crushes Berlin hotel because Israeli prefix was removed on “Arab” request
A French director with Jewish roots sparked a media outcry after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli prefix because Arab guests had "requested" it, according to an official.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s list of countries.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the move was “a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind this sparked even more anger in the director.
“The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the prefix be deleted,” Lanzmann’s official said.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this happened in Germany in this hotel chain is even more shameful.
This does not need an explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked a fairly large resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski Hotel had "abandoned" the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
"Shame you," it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, stands near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly denied all the accusations and called the incident a "mistake" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel on the list of fast voters," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their outrage over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti on walls against interim President Michel Temer.
The most recent protests took place days after mass protests took to the streets in support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to remove her.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70,9 percent in the year-to-year comparison.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are building existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boost was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office issued approximately 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witness sought: Drink market in Waldbröl assault
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the custody of a gun, three dark-dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded cash from the beverage market employee and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-colored VW Golf.
How much money was stolen, the police do not say.
The perpetrators were between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, which is relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
After the assault, the perpetrators must have fled in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and from the Schotter parking lot opposite the parking entrance with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (about 19.45 am) should immediately report to the police.
Games and fun in the summer
Eight beautiful and joyful days were spent by the children and youth of the social-educational day group/social group work of the Nagold Children’s Protection Federation with their caregivers during their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet Hardtwäldle leisure camp, the lively group was locked up during the first week of school holidays.
Several day trips were on the program.
First, we went to Bretten with a visit to the Streichelzoos.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children’s guide in the world famous monastery.
The third trip was to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group had fun at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plunge.
Culinary, children and caregivers were spoiled with their own prepared meals such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, the Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and the Tübinger Bolognese.
At workshops, batik was done, beautiful jewelry was created from pearls and stones, or a Roman mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Colore Evening".
On the day of the trip home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna spiritual care unit were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were accomplished together.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministers to Rome in two years, the Round of Chief Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Different pilgrimage destinations were examined and the final decision was made for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the gate of Mercy opened at Freiburg's Münster.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set out.
The evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small feast in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage cross and gave the pilgrimage blessing.
From Horb, the railway was taken to the starting point of Villingen, where a Münster of Our Lady also stands and thus the pilgrimage from Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse of various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But even on the way, the minis always rested at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song of a dedicated pilgrimage songbook.
For the nights, parish houses of the local parishes were available.
At the stage targets, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and rejuvenating dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went through Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the toughest route, had to descend about 500 meters in height at first, and then climb again.
The winning reward was a common barbecue at the bathweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, we thanked God.
At the evening mass in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by Cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristry and the high altar.
The next day, there was time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scottish Callum Skinner storms home as Brite catches gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner rose to fame last night in the men’s team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his countrymen Sir Chris Hoy had made for himself. The Jungspund made the legend proud as he stormed home to capture a victory from the favourite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after only getting a modest sixth place at the Rail World Championships in London in March despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the rider Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as Hindus appeared.
Hoy’s retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scottish now unfolding.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was slightly behind after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change in strategy made a big part of the transformation, where Hindes ran in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they climbed the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I’m just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph alongside Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, “It feels like London with all the GB flags on the tribune.”
We have been together as a team over the last three months.
We got so bad at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If that’s a barometer of our progress over the past five months, that expect us to be successful five days in the Velodrome.
With Kenny’s form, it’s within the range of possibility that he will repeat Hoy’s victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a harvest of six gold medals and one silver medal.
It would come from today.
Kenny is next to take part in the sprint, which starts today and will run over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I just enjoy this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
They arrived at 3:51,942 at the end.
The world record, which won London Gold in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be the focus.
He had argued with officials yesterday before qualifying when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women’s competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railroad team to dominate the mid-term of the Olympics and pick up a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary demonstration of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio fell.
Dramas took place in the background, including the resignation of technical chief Shane Sutton in April amid accusations of sexism and harassment, as well as the retirement of figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GB, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland smelter questionable due to cancellation of energy contract
The future of Portland’s aluminum melting facility in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the facility operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus terminates all supply contracts, the energy supplier said.
This move followed the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to operate the plant.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs are at stake at Alcoa’s Portland plant.
Not less than 2,000 jobs – both direct and indirect – could be endangered by a closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Melting Factory, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland melting plant loses money and risks closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, lastly, due to the price of electricity for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it is expected that three more owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is mostly owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
“AGL expects the plant in Portland to continue operating, which means further physical demand for electricity from the melting plant,” the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts are so-called “security transactions” that should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the 17th fiscal year," the power supplier said.
All potential impact on revenue on AGL from GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of strong wholesale electricity futures markets.
AGL said it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual statement of $187 million in “expecting termination.”
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts would not impair Alcoa’s “capability to operate the melting plant or ensure the power supply to the melting plant.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, although it still owes an explanation why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are warning about the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry’s poor economic conditions.
Referring to the analysts’ statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as a producer of electricity, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The disclosure of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the all-popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sister’s cover and ending with a classic turn: they’ve all planned a surprise party.
That represents the cliché-captured plot of almost every birthday episode of a children’s show (Seacrest brought the phrase, “Did you think we’ve forgotten you?” with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in that publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has begun.
Kendall’s older sister Kim may have beat her on Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on the cover in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine’s September issue is a league in itself.
The September edition is Vogue’s best-selling edition of the year.
With a scope more like a tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of the 832 pages of the Wälzers were advertising).
The revelation of his cover star is expected so eagerly that in the last two years, the magazine’s images have been scattered even before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more “celebrities who model” than “models who are celebrity” on the cover.
Oscar-winning and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner – described by the magazine as the “breakthrough model” of her generation – falls into the previous category, she’s in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or today’s teens who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if all of this is true of Jenner).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria’s Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them “the stuff of the moment.”
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the cover of Vogue.
But riding around the resentment seems to go by the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
In the real sense of the word, she is a supermodel.
She is running for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises for her foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her paintings of Cindy Crawford’s daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time she’s on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centers remove 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s most needy are rejected annually by municipal rights centers, while the industry is facing the impact of further fund cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unfair delegations and the like — are already rejected when they apply for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services in the municipality, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
James Farrell, director of Queesland’s community rights centers, said the latest survey by the National Association of community rights centers found that thousands of people are already being dismissed each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being rejected from essential services you need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with overwhelming and oppressive debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unjustly fired – all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately lift these fund cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of municipal law centers and their client communities and that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after employee allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inactivity after being informed that its North Carolina campaign leader targeted a gun on an employee while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday at the Charlotte County Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he had waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "it't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, placed his right index finger on the pull, and struck the run in Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his charge.
Having complained to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
“Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment people” — gun owners and gun friends — should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental injury.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, was unable to reach for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
Calls from his consultancy, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.

Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) feature significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This was revealed by representative polls of the opinion research institute INSA for the newspaper "Bild" (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could rule in the north a little further, this is not possible according to survey figures in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have good chances of continuing to hold the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party is only slightly ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the Left and the AfD.
The left would reach 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the Landtag with 19 percent for the first time.
The Greens return to the Schweriner Landtag despite slight losses with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
The NPD and FDP would not be represented in the National Assembly with 3 percent each.
In the Berlin parliamentary elections, the SPD, according to the survey, would only get 23 percent (elections 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
She is thus still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and the Internet in the loop of time: 20 years ago, Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it was not well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would now be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone will now be delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet.
Twenty years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer exhibition Cebit in Hannover as "the office in the west pocket format".
In fact, the new cell phone could do a lot for then-standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was reachable to the Communicator.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, though tormentingly slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, or about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
The market today is dominated by providers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online everywhere and everywhere is everyday for many people today.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion units were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million units.
The worldwide turnover of the devices is approximately 400 billion euros.
Additionally, the well-run business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easily operated via a touch screen.
Apple’s victory began, and today the iPhone is still the group’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the look back.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and other Asian vendors such as Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
“We all have to learn to put the smartphone off,” said Janina Kugel, head of staff at Siemens.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, that was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we made a lot of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.
And they will this again by creating new opportunities for locals and near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport area.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be ashamed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong in Heathrow too.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not for individuals.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 – which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row – to the T2, built in the middle of the world’s two busiest slopes.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It’s time to drive that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, one of the software makers says attempts to bypass ad blocking are equivalent to a “cat and mouse game.”
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post announcing that users could upgrade their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of go-and-go battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the outdoors has been ongoing since the invention of ad-blockers,” and that it’s possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as many as in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has focused on ad blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large percentage of revenue, so Facebook seems worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it would update its “advertising preference tool” to give people more control over targeted ads.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
“For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesman said in an email.
Ad blockers are a dull tool, which is why we’ve instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was struck by several vehicles on a highway in the early morning hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in Canton Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman, who was crossed by several vehicles, including a truck, tried to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to the incident to report.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
It remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will appear.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor must decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases – where a person ran in the dark on the highway – it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing after riding over and killing a man who lay on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and lost consciousness on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman — who had responded to an emergency call — was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a “completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere, could have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still slowly rotated.
The model also highlighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet presumably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
“In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those on Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once thought to be habitable, Venus — over the course of several billions of years — was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen was lost, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the findings of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to too little participation in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado’s Alternative President/General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, what it needs, and bring it to a higher level.
To this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have the right to participate in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are not currently fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me today about this decision,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Awards as the league’s best coach during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and first in the Central Vision, but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and start strike
Working struggles over the salary for North Sea oil workers are suspended as all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oil field service provider Wood Group have been conducted sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the settlement process of the current dispute,” it said in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will begin early next year to re-address the issues.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates on its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate reduction follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give the company the space it needs to get through the market slump.
For its part, Shell has fired thousands of people and announced plans to shut down its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its business as a result of its Megazus merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was aggravated by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers’ leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that has taken place in the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many, not just a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most comprehensive catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and how rotation periods are related to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our findings with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are turning the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot, such as a solar spot.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars rotating slow pirouettes than smaller ones.
“In the ‘ballet’ of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,” Rebull said.
Because the star cluster is so close to the Pleiades, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiadian star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how, when, and why stars slow their rotation rates and so to speak, hang their “dance shoes.”
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiadian rotation rates in three newspapers that will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran for Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in the best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional announcement of resignation, the 41 year old professional will face the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12th for the last time to wear his New York Yankees shirt.
“I love this game and this team.
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star player of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player of the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of his contract on 31 December 2017, he will continue to serve as a consultant and youth coach – with full pay.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees, he made some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the main statistics.
However, in the baseball Hall of Fame, the 41-year-old is not likely to be admitted.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, it was blocked for 211 batches due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect for years receiving performance enhancing drugs from an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could have even done me a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
His farewell days are also silent.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
“My job does not involve a farewell tour.”
“My job involves trying to win every game,” Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have a relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy statements from fans from the Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the fans sang in the 4–9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first cases of doping
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete would have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases became known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically curled athletics competitions, these news come out of time.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Justice for Sport (CAS) on Friday confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old took the fourth place in the final on 100 m butterfly, missing the bronze medal by only 0.09 seconds.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to take part in the prelude over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and to be heard.
The national federation takes the matter “very seriously and asks Chen for full cooperation in the investigations,” Xinhua quoted in a statement: “We will cooperate with the International Sports Court and will accept the verdict.”
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news of the positive test passed on Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the offensive.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,” she told BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-test should also have been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately criticized the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doped nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both refuse to take, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, especially the case of Danekowa is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
The IAAF had banned the start of the entire Russian team except for one exception due to systematic doping, even the runner-up Kenya produced many bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, previous crimes in China had also caused fierce clashes between athletes.
Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
“Sun Yang pinked lila.”
“When I see the podium over 200 meters freestyle, I want to surrender,” Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters,” he said.
Sun was tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but only had to sit a three-month ban.
How hackers blackmail their ransom
Ransomware programmers are currently targeting – and are successfully doing so.
According to a recent survey by Malwarebytes malware defense specialists among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of a ransomware attack at least once in the past 12 months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware blackmail.
40% of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators to reuse the systems and data attacked.
The perpetrators specialize in their ransomware, according to Malwarebytes’ observations, looking at attacks on corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the potentially blackmailed ransom will be significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware," Malwarebytes chief executive Marcin Kleczynski told The World.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks took place frighteningly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works in a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it targetedly searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the original permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the end-encryption code to the files, the victims will need to transfer money – mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are talking about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Consequently, the damage will be higher if a ransomware attacks.
22% of German firms affected loss of revenue due to ransomware, 13% even had to completely discontinue business activities, in one case people were in danger.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks several times, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
“We always say to the victims: don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” Kleczynski explains.
However, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try their best to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to get more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay with Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And if individuals are redeemed after paying a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing the job, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware about within a week.”
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software build-up to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"A customization tool is included so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then search for other hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in to one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
“Typically, the criminals then commission spammers to spread it,” explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies who better back up their data.
More than 50 percent of enterprise IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to counter ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Therefore, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“When data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful blackmail, the perpetrators are instead threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price estimates,” said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes.
This means that the potential for damage depending on the type of data is still many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on entirely new targets on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, unlocking such a blocked heating system could be worth a ransom for so many victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire manufacturing route in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become a problem in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
It sounds pretty overwhelming, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the back, it doesn’t seem narrow anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and look pleasant, only the top of the cockpit falls off a little.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage space.
Not only is there a luggage compartment of 453 l for elevated and 1026 l for folded back seats, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear seat can be folded up like a cinema chair, thus providing storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The luggage can be loaded well, but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very strongly thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He would do his job a little more quietly.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another engine: a 1.5-liter petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The direction is a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Braking Assist (working up to speed 32), the Collision Warning System and the Track Stop Assist.
The collision warner is sometimes irritating because it rated many obstacles as "approaching objects" when ranking.
The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent time controller responds to traffic signal detection and reduces speed if necessary.
Full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are underneath the sleeve and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach.
The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will get the gasoline from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standards.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers that are typical for air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The man broke a knee in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it is a general risk to life, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay compensation to the man.
Disease case: When will the organizer pay
Sick vacationers will only be refunded after their trip if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests showed the same symptoms.
In the case negotiated, one family was severely ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness was attributed to the holidaymakers to a faulty cleaning system that allegedly contaminated the sea water.
The family was of the opinion that the trip was inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the prosecutors did not succeed.
The cleaning system was actually defective.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiff left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was fine.
He did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
No contaminants were found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - is part of the general life risk.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people are concerned about further attacks.
The state must respond prudently and decisively to terror threats at the same time.
Certainly, our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals were to leave the country faster, it would increase security and also strengthen the public’s approval of the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals before the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "at an average four-digit size over several years."
Advertising for terrorism should be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, weapons law is to be updated so that it is especially difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The latter much-discussed duty of silence for doctors should beined, according to de Maizière.
However, in dialogue with the medical team, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens, he said with regard to psychological disorders.
In order to counter the radicalization of refugees, the Minister considers a better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To track down criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly expressed his opposition to actionism.
“That was an earring for the sharp-makers in the CDU/CSU,” Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke media group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general ban on full cover-up to be a constitutional problem.
You cannot ban everything you reject, and I reject wearing the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, on the road or for witnesses in court.
Green leader Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate action and capacity with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: “Float speeches and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring security to the people in this country.”
Improved traffic flow on the highway
It regularly stumbles on the bypass road - here is a picture from November.
But this has to change: the legal trail is to be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are in traffic jams on the surrounding road every night when they cross the highway carrier (A 43).
The state-owned road construction company will extend the right-hand runway by 700 meters on Tuesday and Wednesday (16-17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße departure.
Drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer Road to the right.
The big advantage is that traffic is divided earlier, improving overall traffic on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation of Münster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the Zubringer irritates drivers especially between 17 and 19 o’clock.
On working days, the retreat extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Way and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle hole on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is directed only through the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary carrying power to take on heavy freight traffic on a two-way basis.
How long this congestion and the associated working day congestion will last, the competent state operator cannot say.
However, it is expected to be years: because the bridge has an official residual service life until 2034.
For the extension of the legal track, the state operator has deliberately chosen the weaker traffic time in the school holidays, because disabilities can be expected.
Traffic will pass by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima’s and the Young Theatre are now planning a musical project.
The association Nima’s enables young people with migrant and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play "Das unsichtbare Haus" by the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the “Intercultural Journey” initiated by the Nima’s association, 19 students aged 11 to 15 attended the stage in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the youth in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they have been able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the young theater Münster.
The club Nima’s, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people between 14 and 20 years of age with and without a refugee or migrant background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language instruction are in the planning.
The “Intercultural Journey” project continues.
Given the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of star rains: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the starshot viewers in southwestern Germany in the night of Friday a slide through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was poorly suited to observe the sky spectacle due to clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies in the night of Saturday.
If the weather is good, we will see a lot of stars in the sky.
The star clusters are Perseids, which are among the fastest star clusters with 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they appear to come from the constellation of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Recovering Night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, in the night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep long before the alarm clock.
This is anything other than relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not resting.
What are sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the Board of Directors of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood is insomnia, i.e. an insomnia disorder.
It is precisely sleeping that many people find insatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors of the German Housekeeping Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also drugs.
Not uncommonly, sleep disturbance is the expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially with depression," says Weeß.
And it can be that different factors condition each other.
For example, those who have a disc injury can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and may begin to grumble about everyday problems and worries, Weiss gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When to go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Those who do not sleep well for at least three nights a week for a period of one month and are impaired during the day should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment can look very different: you are depressed, tired, sleepless, have difficulty with attention and concentration, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications – classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any sleep doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the family doctor, Weeß advises.
It can be examined to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in the case of snoring with breathing suppressants, in the case of sick daytime fatigue, in the case of sleepwalkers, or if the cause of a sleep disorder is not found, Fietze explains.
There is no need to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Please don’t go to lunch,” says Fietze.
After the wiring, you go to bed at your usual time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose glasses, a chest belt and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling captures the sleeping person.
How can those affected manage the problems?
There are quite a lot of standing screws where you can start for a better sleep.
Regular sleeping and rising times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is not entirely beneficial.
What the Jungle Camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook about the disappointing defeat of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the short track world championships in Doha, while setting his first world record.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has via Facebook defended himself from his critical ex-team colleagues.
“In a country where an Olympic winner receives a prize of €20,000 and a jungle king has a prize of €150,000, no one should be surprised by missing medals,” he wrote on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming sports is poor, but the doping controls are very good.
In this way, we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at, or even do, doping.
“I’m not saying that controls should be stopped here,” he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be to the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA) nine months before his first launch.
The same should be done with countries.
“Those who cannot be controlled by independent controllers of the WADA/FINA for a certain period of time before the World Cup/Olimpics cannot participate,” says the hamburger, who now runs a ice shop.
Airport: Baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf airport
Dusseldorf police arrested two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 on Thursday.
The suspects committed several baggage and baggage thefts.
Around 21.30 a.m., civil officials in the area of the Düsseldorf airport identified a gang known to police officers from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had acted in a collective, laborious and professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they stole more than 15,000 euros.
Ancient buildings, a few linden trees, a remnant of stone plasters in the meantime: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem so at first sight, but the police count them among the "Dangerous Places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass through playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
At the façade of a grey house someone sprayed "ugly!"
In contrast to a Lidl, which is also expected to be demolished soon, it is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rented apartments will be built here.
Articles about this "trendy district", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, in recent weeks preferably depicted with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but in the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
In particular, the Berlin interior senator Henkel had repeatedly expressed his support for a harsh policy approach against the project since the beginning of the year, describing the area as a “no-go zone” for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After cleaning the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, on June 22, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the spot, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the applause of sympathizers and locals.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before late.
Close to the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many locals: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are mostly upset by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share concerns about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a kiez who mostly sought police protection from the vandalizing left.
The grave that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house occupants and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which still today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
Housing occupations and the resulting housing projects have also long been part of the kiez: in 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße near Rigaer.
While the Mainz had been cleared in a real street battle under a large police effort, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them now local residents from the GDR times and former house occupants share their kiez.
This is also evident in rents, which have increased by 60 percent in new rents since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: you can recognize them on thrown discs or freshly painted façades thrown with colored bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words “left autonomous violence.”
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: Crimes such as bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
The majority of crimes are material damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
When it comes to acts of violence, she is reassuring: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who must not have been.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer directly in Rigaer.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."
Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Rigaer Street - and remained.
That’s why it was so important for her that the locals would get their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed interpretative rule over the district.
But in the eyes of residents like new farmers, the street is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately property apartments, which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well printed are more likely to live here," she says.
“I can absolutely not approve of violence and destruction.”
But what do you do if no one is listening to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For traitors who are upset by colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left-wing scene were part of the kiez.
Those who move out should be aware of this – just like someone who moves into a pub neighborhood can complain badly about noise there.
All persons presented only by first name have asked not to be named by their real name.
Annika Deuschle is the new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact for all stakeholders: refugees, refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunde from the workplace suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-leading wool milk sau, which above all has a problem.
Thus, some — less ridiculously than targeting the multitude of desired tasks — had meant when the administration wanted to write out the job.
A managerial professional with a talent for languages and people, coupled with years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, just an egg-leging wool milk sau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
First and foremost, it is about organization, work with people on the ground and also behind the scenes, and networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
A 50-percent position is limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and official actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be on the road.
For some time now, it has been a serious problem to find housing for the connected refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for subsequent accommodation.
They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from the council office to the municipality and the job center.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for a while.
De facto, the administration does not find private housing.
It does not work so far, depending on private housing, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, communal houses must be humiliated, as it is so beautiful.
Soon new containers will be installed on the road.
But this is not done with housing.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
“More seats would be good,” says Regine Kunde.
Many work in the estate or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is “no employment therapy.”
Work does not mean only work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
This includes administration and volunteers.
It is crucial for refugees to feel welcome and desirable in Germany.
The length of the procedure is a problem.
They must explain to refugees that it takes time and that they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he can’t help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
However, there are also problems, says Customer honestly, "people with whom nothing works at all".
This is a “mammut task.”
A difficult question: Are the two, after the recent events, afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine Kunde says very clearly, "which some may call naive."
The helpers are aware.
This issue is also concerned with refugees.
They are afraid that the assassins will bring them completely into disarray.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
A lot of people would like to stay in Urbach.
Therefore, the main and volunteer must be on the lookout for activities on site and in the region.
At the same time, they always have in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a border?
To answer this question clearly, politics are afraid.
In fact, it is unfair to place helpers on the ground.
“In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we wanted to go,” says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would soothe the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already busy integrating the previous people reasonably.
There are about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no easy answers.
