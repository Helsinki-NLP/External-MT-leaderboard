Not only does this prove that some dinosaurs had feathers, as the theory had been widely accepted, but it also sheds light on details that fossils generally cannot reveal - such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on the upper surface and pale orange on the sides.
The discovery could also provide insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur dinosaurs do not have a well-developed tongue, called a stalk, but have other features of feathers - feathery fibers and plumes - researchers have concluded that stalks are likely the result of later evolutionary development in comparison.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was not used for flight but for temperature control or to attract attention, and the researchers found that although this is a young dinosaur tail, the specimen is a reference to an adult feather, not a feather from a drawer.
The researchers suggested that although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen was showing adult feathers, not juvenile feathers.

In France, voting is traditionally done with little technology: voters lock themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed ballot paper in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter will throw the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope in them before voting and that only duly registered and authorised voters can carry an envelope.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor all the steps of the process, and votes are counted at night, following well-defined procedures, under strict supervision by volunteers.

Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit him, none of them were hurt.
The driver, however, suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged by the Edinburgh Magistrates' Court with the murder of his son.
He's in custody pending charges and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised because his profile has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of the photographs potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at Dundee University, says: "Journalists are on a dangerous path when they publish photos or other information about suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service has told reporters that they will not be discussing the case again until after the arraignment.
According to leaked information, the document refers to the territorial claim that Palestine has based on the borders of the pre-1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PH is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control experiment were kept under strict control by the rangers, as the experiment was observed and evaluated for effectiveness.
NPWS and the National Shooting Sport Association of Australia (NSW) have recruited trained volunteers to the NSW Shooting Sport Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, executive director of the NPWS Parks and Heritage Department, the four shooters selected for the first launch operation received comprehensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in to a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasional violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the accident involving the 27 devices.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overdrive, which the company described as "not serious".
"In response, the ministry called the postponement of Apple's announcement 'truly regrettable.'"
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday, 7:19 p.m. Greenwich time) and was followed by a second earthquake at the same time in the same area.
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Office has reported no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Monitoring Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
A number of hostages were rescued, but at least six others have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took over the position of an elderly lady, because the lady had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as a midwife and began work at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins, while working at the hospital, started investigating preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone could accelerate the development of the baby's fetal lungs.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremity, my first manager, she died two nights ago, she was very special, just like you, a strong woman".
"Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was at least as weird as I am... "maybe even more so... "I love her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place now".
In the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the percentage of 1,400 people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during her 2010 federal election campaign argued that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the voters share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last ruler of Australia.
According to the extreme values of the opinion poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal swimmer was set to compete in the 100- and 200-meter sprints and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints have raised doubts about her strength.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to fight the pain because it's banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
A number of people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, which was then reported on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were the largest suppliers of water to Earth, along with the organic materials that make up proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, after comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political babble and stupidity".
Some say he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide more precise information to pilots.
There will be no additional transport facilities, the surface trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and P+R parking spaces will not be available.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the game being played behind mandatory closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsalai University in Sweden have reported the appearance of a new species that was formed by the crossing of the native medium ground spider (Geospiza fortis) with a new species, the large cactus spider (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into any shape, even to the tiniest degree.
It's a thin, easily twisted and threaded string, which allows for forging or rolling into sheets.
It can be very thin and it can be applied to other metals, and it can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH, and you can make an indicator out of the red clover extract.
The color of the cabbage is determined by the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons formed by electron transfer (since the hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then squeeze them into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in our hands reacts with the outer layers, which gives us a strange sensation and creates a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of chain systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China all had toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women mingled together.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the transmission and sends it back to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space on a rocket, and scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has brought incredible changes to the world, and the biggest thing we have done with the wheel is make transportation much lighter and faster.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, many small cats (including the pet cat) eat a great deal of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the niche concept, a special activity that every cat follows, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
The herds are made up of one to three closely related males and up to 30 females and their young.
Females tend to bond more closely with each other, being big sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave in surprisingly similar ways to wolf packs or dog packs, animals that are similar in behavior to lions (but not like other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (genus Panthera) is a member of a group with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and is the only one of the four big cats that can howl.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-blown roar, but more like a sentence made up of words whispered together.
The ocelot eats animals, and if it can, it will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals it hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots find their prey by following the scent of the animals, sniffing the ground.
They have excellent night vision and are stealthy, so they see well in the dark, and the parrot cat hunts by blending in with the environment and then striking its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, by crossing a mountain or a river, or by crossing a new island and not being able to easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it came from.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population must have different characteristics or must adapt to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be before.
The original population has not changed, but they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it will become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which is the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants, we make our clothes with plants, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but another mosasaurus.
Its long jaws have more than 70 razor teeth and a row of teeth on the palate, so nothing escapes that gets in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a fork-tongued creature, feeding on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, even cannibals.
But it attacked anything that got into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't match it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent, the peanut pellet.
The other difference was that while the poor men and women sat at the table eating their meals, the rich men liked to have feasts together, where they sat side by side and talked.
Ancient Roman food did not include foods that came to Europe in later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples to all their gods, viewing them as the home of the gods.
People offered sacrifices to their gods and priests and tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was only open to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for the deity.
The warm climate of the Middle East meant that the house was not as significant.
Most of the Hebrew families lived outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open-plan counters facing the street; the houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan had no large forests, so the tree was considered a very precious treasure.
Greenland was a sparsely populated land, and the Norwegians say that Red Hen was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each of these countries was Scandinavian, the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed in many ways.
If you've seen the movie "The Golden Nation", you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a back cover, it is not a treasure map.
"The words 'The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776' are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, the text being written in reverse at the bottom of the document".
Although the identity of its author is uncertain, it is known that the large (29.5 inches long and 24.5 inches wide) parchment document was unrolled and stored shortly after its completion.
So it's likely that the mark was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
This was ruled by the Vichy French, these were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, an invasion known as Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that is shared within a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, civis, and civitas, which mean citizen, citizen, or city or city-state, the latter of which determines to some extent the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations, and the civilized crib involves the transmission of knowledge over a few generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence behind, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the 13 states first established a weak central government - with Congress as the only constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and there was no national executive or judicial body to enforce its laws, which were often left to the reluctant public authorities.
It did not have the power to override tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The amendment of the Constitution required the unanimous consent of all the states, but the states did not take the central government seriously enough that their representatives often stayed away from the meetings.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national football team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
"Because of its grouping of islands, Japan is often called an 'island' in geographical terms".
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name - Ilha Formosa - meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, reformed the native grain-producing methods, and employed Chinese laborers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western part of Taiwan and the northern coastal areas, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, giving Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main parts, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Faced Temple.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work is still underway.
For example, the most common still-film format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the dawn of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but what's important is that it's been taken over by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36m wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (after division by 12 to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) can therefore be set to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are equal to or approach this aspect ratio.
The often misused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamism while maintaining the measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective place for the main theme is the section of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under the thumb of the dictator.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together, despite differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used specifically for this purpose.
The church's central authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has caused many to question its basic doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated the general international rights enshrined in several international agreements over the previous two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing behavior of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job in New York City with the Edison Company.
When he arrived in the United States, he had nothing but a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former boss).
Ancient China had a distinctive way of representing the different eras: every era and every powerful family in China's history had a distinctive dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles fighting for the throne fought fierce battles with each other.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest seat in the palace of Xi'an.
There's a lot of social and political impact of the ten-pointers, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and a belief in the country as the people and not as an independent ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to overcome.
The same is true of the military, since instead of the rank of the army being determined by the class, it is now based on the rank of the service.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed members of the working class in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Mohamed showed a deep interest in things beyond the world, and he regularly visited a cave on the "Noor" (light) mountain, which became known as a place of meditation, "Hira".
It is the cave itself that has stood the test of time and gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the outside world.
We're more than easy to find, even if you knew it existed, once you get inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
Nothing else can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, a world rarely seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), as well as several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid of Khufu, several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' mark is a V-shape, and the 'down' mark looks like a peg or square with the bottom missing.
Up means that the mount should start and press the bow, down means that it should start from the sleeve (where it holds its hand on the bow) and pull the bow.
"The 'up' pull usually produces a softer sound, while the 'down' pull is stronger and more distinct".
Feel free to mark your comments with a pencil, but remember that the printed signals are there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market-goers.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
Suddenly, in front of the frightened queen, a member of the crowd shook the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war costs of US imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover most of the cost, and the bonds were funneled to Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that came from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, they were the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the circumstances that led to the formation of the order.
The era of events is usually referred to as the Late Middle Ages in European history during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends about 1500.
Technological determinism includes a wide range of ideas in practice, the advocacy of technology or technological imperative is strictly based on the sense that human destiny is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that on the other hand, technology has ""impacts"" on societies, and these effects are inherent rather than socially conditioned".
For example, there is a view that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable with few cars, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car crashes also lead to high road accident rates, which in health care stimulate the invention of new techniques to heal injured bodies.
A significant part of Romanticism was shaped by cultural determinism and was inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geographically-bound customs and culture developed that, in harmony with the location of the community, proved superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the world of its time, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Famous as the epicentre of luxury, it began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 B.C.
Its position deteriorated in the 12th century, primarily because the Crusaders rejected suspicious gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued above what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this time that Paris won the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 11th century.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine Eastern culture.
However, because of the slow methods of communication, the styles in the West may have been lagging behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments that resulted from the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to secure their clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses conserved seeds and rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow for self-esteem.
Subcultures can be characterized by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of its members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership with a recognizable style symbol system that includes fashion, behavioral patterns, and the use of slang.
One of the most common ways of showing the importance of socialization is to point to the example of some unfortunate children who, through neglect, misfortune, or premeditated abuse, were not allowed to socialize with adults in their adulthood.
Some of these children were separated from their human parents, often by their own parents, and in some cases, the child's abandonment was a parental rejection due to severe intellectual or physical disability.
The children who were left behind may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others are said to have been raised with animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by animals that are not fully human, a child in the wild, with physical limitations, will almost entirely adopt the behavior patterns of the animal that cares for him, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the platform goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that provides support to those who are engaged in a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
"The stands can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of 'stand' and the little man with the little stick in Microsoft Office".
The virtual workstations were built into the software to question, to question and to explain the procedures that would have challenged the student to do the task on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
A child should never be allowed to grow up without a nurturing, caring, and nurturing environment, but it does happen.
We consider foster care a safe zone for these children.
The goal of our foster care is a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and a reliable health care system.
The orphanages must provide all the needs that are lacking in the former home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in terms of the model of use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also new motivational factors in Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study, which focused on audience response to web pages.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-facial expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Especially when it is claimed that some can correctly tell when someone is lying by certain facial expressions.
In his essay on the President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out that people with brain damage, who cannot interpret speech, have a very good sense of sincerity.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior is found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two variations of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation provides the opportunity for new genetic variation, and selection removes the variation expressed from the population.
A mixture of segregation and recombination, the back-and-forth variation between the two currencies for each generation.
Outside the savannah, primates with human-like digestive systems have difficulty meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant resources to access would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (cloves, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large supply of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
So, all things considered, it wouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to how chimps do it in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the deliberate awakening from a normal sleep cycle and the process of falling back to sleep within a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring it to a state of alertness without waking it up completely.
If you reset the clock in your sleep, put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluids (especially water, tea, which is a common urinator) before sleep, forcing the person to urinate at night.
The measure of inner peace that a person has is the opposite of the measure of tension of the body and the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and the opportunity for each person to rest in perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that can prevent us from achieving that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the way of love in the Mahayana and many techniques originating from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it's a path of Kundalini yoga, meditation and all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga is used to awaken the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is on the deity-yoga, wherein the visualization of many deities clears the energy channels, activates chakras, and illumines the consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and at the end of the war, the two countries were thrown into conflict as a result of differences in systems, methods and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
For the next 40 years, proxy armies clashed in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization through the Romanian bridgehead.
At the same time, these plans were declared obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and large amounts of goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that the country has the ability to move people and goods while impeding the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to bring people and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy tried, mainly by submarines, to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for their readily available source of milk, as well as for their fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that migrated over hills or other pastures, often under the supervision of child or adolescent goatherds, similar to the more widely known herders, and these grazing methods are still used today.
The first racetracks were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the rails were only parallel-paved, they allowed the horses to pull faster and carry more than the relatively few winding roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used quickly enough to hold the track in place, but they also slowly realized that it would be more efficient to put a piece of iron on it.
This became a daily practice, but the iron made better use of the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking on two feet about two million years ago, around the same time as Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not yet able to walk upright.
The bipedal tree formations are found in the fossil record of Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to some extent, to reduce the suffering of the future.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we want to go beyond a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and fix it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of man's advances in science and technology, and problems have become more and more acute because of overpopulation and man's luxurious lifestyle.
After its July 4th introduction to Congress, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now called "Dunlap prints".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read by his New York team on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that still exist today are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and that is the birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Birds also look a lot like dinosaurs.
They have spiny and pointy legs, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, which we call binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in the official sense of this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that have adapted well to parasitize humans.
Both robber and bed bugs are nest-builders, that is, they are suitable for nest-building or use the host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby
In adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights to another couple to raise the child.
The main goal of science is to use scientific methods to find out how the world works, and this method is essentially the basis of most scientific research.
But it's not just that, it's experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is designed to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to observe, which also helps scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek language proficiency declined, the West cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The majority of physiological and behavioural rhythms in most cases depend significantly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production during the biological cycle.
In most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, periodic rhythms are observed, which are not mere reactions to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that cycles freely even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence for the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out in which DNA of the rod was marked with radioactive phosphorus or protein of the rod was marked with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in the stem cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in and enjoy natural sites, including flora and fauna.
On-site programs include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park tours, and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from rural towns to work, passing by people whose workplace is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting, somehow everyone is connected to everyone, and it supports a transport system based on the use of private cars.
Science suggests that this huge carbon dioxide release has separated the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone has complaints about them.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or breaking bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems generate these complaints, why do they fail every day, are the transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range; thus traffic processes generally have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in roughly any order.
To better represent the flow of traffic, three main characteristics were correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links help in the design, construction and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings along their bodies.
It gives them more places to hide from predators.
Today, only the stork and the crayfish can't fold their hind wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and, indeed, the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth spinning, do you?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, and its water supply is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide in places.
The Amazon is the source of 20 percent of the river water that flows into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and architectural excellence of the Pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their ancestors, who were by then well over a millennium old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest and least populated independent country in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of the state's workers, while Latin is used mostly in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known since ancient times about such basic chemical elements as gold, silver, and copper, because they are all found in nature as raw materials and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought these would become new materials that we could see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals, and it's important to note that there are a lot of chemical elements in the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium and other elements are considered metals, but there are other metals, like silver and gold.
Some alloys may contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as coal.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a billion of them could fit at the end of a sentence.
So when the pencil came out, it did a lot of good for a lot of people.
Sadly, as new writing methods developed, the pencil was downgraded and used less.
People are texting on computer screens these days, and they never go near a mountaineer.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like if they come up with some new development.
The fission bomb works on the principle that the collision of the nucleus with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's like driving a heavy truck up a mountain, and the re-splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that sometimes they split up on their own or with little effect.
The moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner below the tides and thicker below the plateaus.
It's possible that there's more black rock nearby because the crust is thinner, so the lava is easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what piques their interest.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during adulthood.
These theories look at what it is that makes certain people want the things that they do, and what in their environment makes them do or not do those things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can develop when leaders start leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum is when they try to stay ahead of the guys"" (or girls)".
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering disciplinary procedures, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that everything the group has created has to be changed and made his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often creates conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
The excellence of virtual teams is measured by the same benchmark as that of traditional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often act as a liaison to the physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which the local management may not understand.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique characteristic of the virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leadership team to which the members report. The invisible team sets the standard for the members".
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organisation?
When all available resources in an organization's functional departments are used efficiently, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome obstacles creates a new innovative process within the organisation to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organizations achieve greater performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and so it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the scientists' observations.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and even cause changes in certain mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to observe structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
And this provides us with a wealth of information and material that we can use to build simulation models to understand what's going on in our minds.
Despite its strong science fiction connotations, AI is actually a very important branch of computing that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as in many home computer and video game software.
Class trips are a big part of every classroom, and teachers are often happy to take their students to places where bus trips are not possible.
Technology allows for virtual excursions, allowing students to see museum art, visit an aquarium, or admire any artwork while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual sharing of class field trips is also a great way to reflect back on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their visit to the state capital, and they revise the website every year, but they keep the old versions online as a souvenir book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the appearance of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger considers developing writing skills to be key to avoiding criticism.
At the same time, blogging forces students to better understand the world around them.
Blogging is a tool to inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs can prepare students to become more analytical and critical; active response to online material can help students to define their own position vis-à-vis the writing of others and their own view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, and it has a number of art galleries and museums that tell us about Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, the untamed natural beauty of Muskoka.
These, along with many other things, make Ontario look unadulteratedly Canadian to foreigners.
Farther north, vast areas of sparsely inhabited land and sometimes almost uninhabited wilderness can be found.
A demographic that surprises many people is that there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Archipelago lies in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most continental continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and conquered considerable territory in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is bordered by the Sahel, the western and southern parts by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women travelers are advised to refer to themselves as married, regardless of marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something they may consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stand on the edge (cultural differences here or there are not acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century C.E., and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it, rebuilt it as Casa Branca, and then abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan, Daru l-Badya, rebuilt the city, and Spanish merchants named it Casablanca and established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tazin, charcoal, leather goods, water pipe and all kinds of snacks, but here everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, before visiting Goma outside, one should be aware of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is the starting point for climbing Mount Nyragongo, and it is also one of the cheapest places in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
Bodas can be used for transportation within Goma. The usual (local) fare for a shorter journey is around 500 Congolese francs.
The relative isolation of the region has led to the metaphor of Timbuktu being used to describe exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation has given it a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations in the Henry Louis Gates PBS series of the Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arab than African in tone.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Krokodil River to the south.
The park covers some 7,500 square miles (19,500 square kilometers) and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each home to a different species.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is the flagship of the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
As in all South African national parks, the nature reserve and admission fee must be changed.
"It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows you to enter selected South African parks or all South African national parks".
Hong Kong, named after the island of Hong Kong, is a focal point for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that form the silhouette of Hong Kong resembles a glittering colonnade diagram, which is further enhanced by the Victoria Harbor.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across the way.
The urban part of Hong Kong Island is mostly concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site occupied by the English colonizers, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching 50 miles [80 km] from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Indian part of the forest is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are also home to some of the last remnants of the once-vast jungle that covered the entire Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans is a 3850 km2 area, of which about one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
The Sundarbans area has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is estimated to have 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses often fill up, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese shore buses, which are comfortable and have a high capacity.
The shuttle taxi is a quick and convenient solution for visiting places nearby, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge across the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83 m], with two traffic lanes measuring 1,100 feet [378 m] long and 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs clearance points are estimated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic life of hunting and subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua tribes, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as Paraguay, was a vast Indian province that was created in the 16th century by the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year will be in December at the Las Cañitas horse racing track.
At other times of the year, less prestigious competitions and matches can also be viewed here.
For news about the championships and to buy tickets for the T-shirt matches, visit the Asociación Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Currency exchange is only possible at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and surrounding areas, and Stanley cards and US dollars are often used for payments.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and American currency may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so change money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is found on the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold - temperatures rarely go below freezing - but combined wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly wet and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to interacting with humans, the wild world is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authority says to keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife.
As permissive as they may seem, buffalo, rhino, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are vulnerable.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so we have to give them space to move around.
It is also important to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so be careful not to cook or bring food with strong smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British battleship, with about 200 Americans and Germans dead.
During a struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, a grand chief, was assassinated at a peaceful gathering in the city.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is connected by two harbours, and the most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the sandy beaches are safe to swim on, and most provide shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with all kinds of businesses lining the beach.
"The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'".
There's plenty of French wine to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better for the journey.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians, with the short black called 'espresso', the cappuccino being stacked with a lot of cream (not foam), and the tea being served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but of the highest quality.
Many visitors come to the reef year-round, and injuries are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, follow the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, the hedgehog has been found near beaches and river mouths between October and April, and occasionally elsewhere during those times.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and prefer to stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean, their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have special offers for certain hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as a camping site.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They may keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) necessary for the destination.
Any changes or requests should be sent first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At certain music festivals, a significant majority of the attendees choose to camp on-site, and in fact, most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get to a campsite close to the music.
Remember, even though the concert on the main stage is over, there may be areas of the festival that continue playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, watch your cabin's position, because sailing through the ice can make a terrible noise to those who are too close.
The tour of St Petersburg is part of the sightseeing tour.Visa-free cruise passengers (check conditions)
Casinos generally make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and in the room.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages at the expense of the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and any good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
All drivers on high altitudes or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive on them like you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, as much snow can fall as much traffic in a very short time.
The visibility may be limited by snow or snow blowing, snow falling or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic is uninterrupted throughout the year.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and provide outstanding experiences for visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to trips on land to see the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, venture close to cars, so they are easy to observe with average equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they're better seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalking safari, hiking safari, or trekking safari) consists of a series of hiking trips of a few hours or more.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events being held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may find yourself in a strange situation.
Cancellation terms vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation terms do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that tickets will generally cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with ticket prices typically around ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes helps with drying. There are ironing boards and ironing boards in many hotels that you can use even if you don't have one in your room.
If you don't have a cast iron or don't like to wear cast iron socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Care should be taken not to allow the tissue to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, irritation).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes longer.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they may not have encountered in their homes before.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, and spread poison or infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free purchases are purchases of goods at certain locations free of duty and surcharge.
Travellers to countries with heavy tax burdens can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on alcoholic drinks and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging for driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, which often passes through isolated, backwoods areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: steep climbs, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are the hallmarks of the road.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than those for the previous and following sections  generally 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is of paramount importance.
Interestingly, however, the area is much stronger here than on other parts of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery is very good, and in Bavaria it's quite rich and varied, in that it resembles its southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked all year round, and cherries and plums are baked in summer.
Many German baked goods, however, contain almonds, nuts, and other nuts, and the more popular pastries often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but tasty cakes, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, made with meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be either 'dry' or 'soupy' depending on how much liquid it contains".
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is often used, while in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used to make curry.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that covers the vast array of cuisines found in the country's landscapes.
However, when used without other qualification, the term refers mostly to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is widely present throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes, with Javanese flavors dominated by peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is supported by two hinged legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but their use raises safety concerns because the rider's foot may get stuck.
If the horse throws the rider, but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can pull him along if he continues to ride.
First, most competitors wear flat, narrow-soled, heel-heeled riding boots.
Then some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety rods that allow the saddle to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back while falling.
The Cochamo Valley is a prominent mountaineering destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various large granite walls and fissures.
From the tops of the mountains, breathtaking views are seen, and climbers from all over the world continue to create new routes on the walls of endless possibility.
Slip-on snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, including skating on snow with skis or snowboards attached to feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fan base, fans are sometimes referred to as ski lovers, and entire vacations are planned around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backcountry skiing: Backcountry skiing is also called skiing, backcross, backcountry skiing, backcountry skiing, backcountry skiing, or backcountry skiing.
It is associated with but usually not accompanied by an alpine-style ski or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and with much tighter skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover more distance than you can walk - but you will rarely reach the speed needed to ski without a heavy backpack on the groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small number of independent countries, and normally, crossing several countries would mean passing visa and passport checks several times.
But the Schengen area, in this respect, operates somewhat like a country.
While you are in this zone, you will not normally need to pass through any new passport control points when crossing borders.
Similarly, a Schengen visa eliminates the need to exchange a visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition of which manufactured objects are antiques, although some tax authorities define antiques as objects that are over 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical location, with some places having a shorter age limit than Europe, such as North America.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar products produced in series.
Reindeer farming was and is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding the business sector is important for many other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer mostly as drovers.
Today, many Saami people work in modern trades.

If you plan to visit a war zone, you may want to take some professional training.
If you search the internet for the words "Hostile Environment Course", you'll probably find an address for a local company.
The course generally covers all the issues discussed in much greater detail, in most cases with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes gun training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Passengers planning non-rehabilitation surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The attitude of individual governments differs as to whether they are willing to issue a passport with the gender not marked (X) or a document containing the new name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is just as variable.
Security checkpoints became more disturbing in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who are about to have surgery cannot expect their privacy and dignity to be compromised when they go through a body scanner.
Returning currents are the returning currents of waves breaking away from the coast, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology has caused the return flow to be compressed in some deeper sections, and a fast flow may develop in deep water there.
Most deaths are from fatigue when trying to swim against the current, which is almost impossible.
Once the current is out of the way, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than it was in the mainstream.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be dragged again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, it's worth waiting for rescue.

After a period abroad, he returns home to adapt to a new culture and abandons some of the customs of his home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people may have been patient and understanding with you, recognizing that travelers in an unknown land must adapt.
People probably don't think that returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most interesting sights in the neighborhood for children.

The sphinx provides the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries and this area has the most bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The group of islands lies 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among them are Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter of which has a spectacular natural harbor, flooded by a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge with the plains and then rise again, forming the 200-mile chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, topped by Mount Vinston at 4,892 m (18,932 ft).

Participation in these education programmes is usually tuition-free.
"Finland is a great boating destination. 'The land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of small islands in the lakes and coastal archipelago".
In the world of islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for yachting, smaller boats or even kayaks can provide other experiences.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and one in seven or eight people own a boat.
This is also the case for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise rather unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one in forty).
Most prominent Baltic Sea routes offer a long stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days, spending the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore for boat trips, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some of the brochures also mention Berlin, Germany, as shown on the map above, since Berlin is not near the sea, the cost of the trip is not included.
Flying can be daunting for anyone of any age and background, especially if you have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There's no shame in that, it's the same as having personal fears or not liking something -- a lot of people have that.
For some, a partial understanding of the operation of aircraft and of flight events may help to overcome the fear that is rooted in a lack of knowledge or control.
The courier companies pay good money for fast delivery, and time is a key factor when it comes to business documents, goods, or urgent repairs to parts.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and with smaller companies, there have been problems.
If you send things by air freight, some routes might have days to unpack and clear customs.
We're offering it as checked baggage for faster transit, but the airline rules don't allow a package to be sent without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a hefty bill for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
But it is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay four times the usual fare in business class and eleven times the usual fare in first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats between points A and B.
Airlines know that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a large sum for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a corresponding fee.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the self-proclaimed Republic of Moldova in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but the country is not recognized by any UN member.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
In Moldova, Orthodox Christianity is the main religion.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.

We ask that you treat this place with the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not distort the scene by drawing graffiti or scratching into the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population speaks Catalan, most of the population understands it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are in Catalan, which is the first official language according to the law.

The system announcements in the metro are only heard in Catalan, but the unexpected disturbances can be heard through an automated system in several languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is still to behave in the best way possible: as someone bien élevé (well-educated), which will make things much easier.
The crude behaviour of the Parisians will quickly disappear if a few basic forms of politeness are observed.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is a very forested area, mostly of beech, spruce and coniferous trees and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly diverse plant community, due to its microclimate range, different soil types and different altitude levels.
The area was also home to a great variety of animals and birds.
Rare fauna is found here, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, hippopotamus, wildcat and deaf-mute, as well as many other more common species
Women must wear a knee-length skirt and shoulder-length covers when visiting the monasteries.
Most convents provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a bright color, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.

Nevertheless, people who know a little Spanish will quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and are becoming museums or educational sites.
In their heyday, light pollution was not such a problem, so they were mostly found in cities or on college campuses, where they were more accessible than their modern-day counterparts.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in a remote area with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

Japanese work culture is more formal and hierarchical than what Westerners are used to.
The suit is a business attire, and employees call each other by their last name or by their job title.
Harmony at work is crucial, so it is important to focus on team efforts rather than individual achievements.
Employees must seek the approval of their superiors before making any decision and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
