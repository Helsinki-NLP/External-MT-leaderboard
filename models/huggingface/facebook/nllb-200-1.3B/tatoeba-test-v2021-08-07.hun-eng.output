I should go there.
I should have asked Tom first.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been more focused.
I should have been more specific.
I should have been more thorough.

I should have done that with you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I never should have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should have denied doing that.
I should have seen this coming.
I should have stayed out of it.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should have counted on that.
I should have taken your advice.

I just want to know what it's about.

I sleep with two pillows.
I slept for an hour after midnight last night.
I fell asleep, I was late for school.
I slept for nine hours.
I slept with my boss.
I've been up to the turkey.
Mary is Tom's mother?
I'm going to smoke.
Monday is good?
Do I make myself clear?
I clicked on a picture.
I snuck into the house.
I ran into the house.
I was just doing it.
Is that okay?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't that a little bit of a pain in the stomach?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I get sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
How far is Paris?

I stayed.
Tea is more expensive than milk?
Are you allowed?

A secret?
Is that right?
Is that intentional?
Is that fly in the picture or is it photographed there?
Is that fly in the picture or on it?
Is that my cup?
Is that a public record?
Is that a problem for you?
Is that real money?

I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
I remember it clearly, it was seven or eight years ago, where exactly?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to enjoy.
There's still one or two things to put in the suitcase.
I have to get some breakfast.
I still think it's the best option.
Is Tom a Christian?

I stood by her.
I stopped by your place today, but you weren't home.
I stopped to talk.
I study for about two hours every day.
I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I assume you're packed and ready to go.
I must have heard that sound somewhere before.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?
Are you doing dangerous work?
Is your mom home?
Is your mom home?
No doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're over it.
I'll take your place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
He just came out of nowhere.
You'd be better off with your sister.
It goes hand in hand with the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
This one costs two euros.
There must be a problem.
It's got to be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all that work wasted.
It's obviously freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
It's not stopped snowing.
It's not stopped snowing.
I'm not sure if you're coming.
He's not doing anything.
It doesn't matter who started it or why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it was poured on me.
I realized I misunderstood him.
It snowed the day before.
Thanks for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
It happened earlier last week.
That was the day we were married, darling.
There had to be a reason for this.
It was sudden.
That was when he was out.
It's happened to me a few times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat person should diet.
I think everyone is hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think I dropped some film blocks.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I could kill.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm going to die.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I guess I need more time.
I thought I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's all right.
There's very little chance, in my opinion, that you'll be able to do that on your own.
I think he's going.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.
I think it is.
I think it was Tom who helped Mary.
I think you'd better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I find spiders to be sweet.
I think she's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about that.
I think that would explain everything.
I think, so I drink.
I think, therefore I am.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think you did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's going to be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve that problem.
I think Tom's been there.
I think Tom is a turn-on.
I think Tom is still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tom wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tom is winning.
I think we can handle it.
I think we should be patient.
I think we're headed in the wrong direction.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all screwed now.
I think you've dialed the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Tom's girlfriend's name is.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I think you'd like it.
I think you've got it all wrong.
I think you should go in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you're doing a very good job.
I think you smell good.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I guess you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought maybe going out to eat would cheer you up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought I was clear on what I wanted.
I thought my head was going to explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't turn out to be so.
I thought Tom was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
That hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under the influence.
It had a big impact on me.
This is dangerous!
This is a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what you're talking about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I doubt it'll work.
It's getting very late.
She's gone. She's not here.
It's half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time for you to start a new business.
It's important to propagate our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
She's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's the south.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be turned off.
This is not the best solution.
This is not the right way to go.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying to you.
It's not proper to speak with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Wow, the weather is really bad today.
It's very expensive.
It's about 30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
That's useful information.
It's hot at night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you change the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's going to be dangerous.
It'll be dark by the time we get home.
It'll be ready when it's time.
It'll be ready when you need it.
It'll take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
He's going to be gone soon.
It'll work if I switch the polarities.
It therefore appears larger.
It looks good.
I guess I'm not needed here.
You could use a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling very well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what counts.
That could be a long time.
It could be a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
I might be late.
I need to wash it.
It must mean something.
It must have been love.
It was definitely stolen.
It needs to be fixed.
He never existed.
It should never have happened.
I lied to him even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do my best.
I told him to come.
I told Tom not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you wouldn't listen.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tom.
I have a question for you.
I took a long bath.
I was in the tub for a long time.
I've got it covered.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you'd be on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It's probably cheaper elsewhere.
It started raining yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I train two hours a day.
I've been all over Russia.
I've been traveling across the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tom.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'm trying to keep up with the news.
I'm trying to get my head around this.
That's a good flag.
A cat with a big fur.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
This is a dictionary.
Good plan, on paper.
It's a gray stone building.
This is a guard dog.
It's half an hour until lunch.
It's a hot day.
This is a kitchen knife.
It's totally dark out.
This is all mine.
It's all right.
That's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
This is all your fault.
It's already 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's already ten o'clock at night.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a stream.
It's always the same note.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's a nasty business, Watson, a nasty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a pity.
I'm sorry I was late.
It's a shame Tom is leaving.
That's a pretty big stick.
That's a rumor.
It's freezing cold.
It's as much art as it is science.
That's in the past.
She's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where a little mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a funny question to ask.
This is awful.
It's been a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
It's a tiring day.
It's a rough day.
It's happened before.
It wasn't just any week.
It's been two years since you left.
That's better.
It's better to water the garden at night.
It's hot.
It's a fire.
It's cheaper to take the bus.
That's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in here.
It's cold, I'm a little gray.
It's cold out there.
Why don't you get a sweater?
It's well known that bears love honey.
It doesn't matter whether Tom did it or not.
That's perfectly normal.
It's all right.
It's dangerous out here.
It's deep here.
This is delicious.
It's finished.
It's easier to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave by far.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mary.
It seemed like a lifetime to me.
It seemed like the bus was late.
That sounds completely ridiculous.
It seems like it was only yesterday that we went to school together.
It seems like nothing's changed.
He looks really weird.
It seems so.
He seems to be lying.
It seems Tom isn't in a hurry.
Like you don't want me to get it.
You seem honest to me.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're having a special guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
It's expensive.
It's fair that they get equal pay for equal work.
It's not even close to perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is yours.
You know, it's funny.
It's starting to get crazy.
It's getting serious.
It's going to be a rough winter.
It's not gonna be easy.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for studying.
It's great you could make it.
That's good, I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to believe it's been so clear and sunny all this time.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench to sleep on in this town.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's incredibly beautiful.
His head is disproportionately large.
It's high.
The kids should be in bed.
Stop wasting money.
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's against the law.
This is important.
It is important that parents be on the same page when it comes to raising children.
It's important to help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You're going to have to choke in here.
There's no air in here.
It's impossible to live up to your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
You never know what tomorrow will bring.
It's unbelievable, you know?
It's not going to happen.
This is inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just getting further away.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's pretty heavy.
That's pretty relevant.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's very kind of you to say.
It's late.
It's laundry day.
It's like an underwater field, and the turtles, rays and sharks are above it, like flying creatures.
This is locked.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
This is me.
It's pathetic the way he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
It's my turn now.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
That's not a bad idea.
This isn't a bank.
It's not as gruesome as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
You can't change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
There's no point in whining about it.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to a priest if you don't repent.
There's no point in being bitter about the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's obviously impossible.
Obviously weird.
Obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay to be gay.
Three months have passed and Tom says he speaks fluent French. Well, he's at the top of his game. What's the top?
Just three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
That sounds good.
It's over, right?
It's over.
It's personal to me.
It's pouring like a sponge.
She spread her wings.
It's really amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple, you know.
It is quite obvious that the aim of these misanthropic theories is to show the working class' self-esteem, to absolve imperialism of responsibility for the bloody wars it has instigated, and to refute the idea that the endless wars are caused by man's innate aggressive tendencies.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, right?
That's a really big number.
It's right there.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit, you!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston right now.
It's so good to be home.
It's still moving.
This is suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem as before.
That still needs an answer.
It's time to get our tents.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
It's time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should get my hair cut.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's about time we did something about it.
Tom has his birthday today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tom's word is against Mary's.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive for me.
It's too hot for that now.
It's late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn weather.
A cold sucks.
It's ugly, it's rusty yellow, and it doesn't match anything, but at least they don't get lost in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It's unlikely anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you if we go there or not.
He's very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's a lot of fun.
It's expensive to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's the deal.
It's your only chance.
It takes about 10,000 hours of study to master a language thoroughly.
You have to be brave to succeed.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It hit everyone unexpectedly.
It took exactly an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from the cold.
Tom took a long time to pick out a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but we finally found him.
I turned into a small alley.
I did.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was really good food.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was awfully weird.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful evening.
It was chaotic.
It was clearly very enjoyable.
We had a good time last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and humid.
It was hot, and it was humid.
It was just a little trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
I wanted to.
It was almost dark.
It was not long before John had an idea, and John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy keeping my promise.
That was a low blow.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who sliced the door open.
It wasn't my fault.
I didn't mean to.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
It wasn't the first time they'd done that.
It wasn't Tom.
It was a joke.
I only knew his true intentions when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It rained last night.
It was kind of weird.
That was really interesting.
That was really fast.
It was really sad.
He was successful.
That was great.
That's all I could think about.
It was the worst pain I've ever experienced.
Tom followed.
They kept it a secret.
