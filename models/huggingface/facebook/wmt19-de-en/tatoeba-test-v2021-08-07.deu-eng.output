The main task of the kings was to build a tomb, which was thought to be as timeless as the stars above the sands of time, where everything else sank. Planning the afterlife was more important than the life itself, which was only the way to it.

Certainly, much was embellished, and in later times even battles were depicted that had not taken place at all.
