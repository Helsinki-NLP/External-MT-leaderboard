Stay here with them.

You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You are wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.

What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other people's business.
Who's the one in the blue shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for the eyes.

How many pens!
Mary, are you in the proper mood?
I corrected the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom did 20 push-ups.

You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.

Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.

I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting in my chair?
It sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy that.

There are always a lot of vehicles on this road.
You fooled us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.

I'm really hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom takes care of the horses.

I showed my friends these postcards.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.

Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in the horrible, from the point of view of the Jews, Galilee dialect of Aramaic instead of Hebrew, thus showing the unwarranted claims about the existence of any sacred language, the use of which in prayers especially brings us closer to God.

I tried to wake Tom.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we were late because of the heavy rain.
She seems to be in good health.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Watch your little brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on Saturdays?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympics.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do it together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.

You having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.

How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more complex it seemed.
His gray eyes sparkled and sparkled, and his normally pale face came alive and covered with a redness.
What kind of pizza do you like best?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Have some more.
I'm looking for my passport.

The typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Can anyone here speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me get your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Tom has the power.
I learned to practice and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?

We're not afraid of battle.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's get out of here!
Do it before it gets dark.

Bring your wife.

You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom is wearing a pirate suit.
That's the truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.

My work is my passion.
Why didn't you ask me?
Tom should be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We're proud of what we've accomplished.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a mailman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know this man is who he says he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald the Blue Tooth, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia. I'm not going to Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost all were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad has happened.
It's been a very hot couple of days.
He put on a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Tom never saw Mary again.
You're not allowed in this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hesse.
To tell you the truth, I never spoke Portuguese.

This fruit is very sour.

Another day has passed.
You have to do this right now.
I have to go for an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, hurry up! We're going to be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is world famous for its hamburgers.
Tom made Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have an opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock is broken.
Diamonds are precious stones.
Enjoy the cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's going to be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was that too easy?
What Alice encountered while waiting for an answer was a sudden cry, a loud noise, so sharp that it tore her drum bridges apart, and so loud that it reached the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he came into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary put her things in the car.
You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
If he calls, he'll answer.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried banana pie?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Well, isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
Rich people sometimes look down on poor people.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complex.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president is in office for four years.
I'm glad you're happy about it.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have on you?
Can you solve this problem?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
The building is 20 stories.
If you're not going, I'm not going.
Do you happen to know when Tom is coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you hold on a second?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not gonna fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had taken my advice then, he'd be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as a donkey.
I think you're a reliable man.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a hunch that Mary was going to bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl answered.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom that you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom has small noses.
Did you understand what she said?
You're a little distracted.
Don't be mad at her.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe that everything's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom has to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on foreign soil.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
Don't you know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're already done here.
How do you like your new class?
Be afraid of your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept to him; he always had enough to eat.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
I was poisoned.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
He looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her feet hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
Can you give me a minute, I need to talk to you about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to a hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do that again.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure what size it is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll leave as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
You want to try again?
Just a little while.
What are you so upset about?
Milk can be used to make butter, cheese, and many other things.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, remember those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, right?
You are drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He blinked in response.
Tom said Mary was pleased.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Did you think about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's hungry but me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in the avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll take care of this.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
That's a spit.
I really liked this book.
You are important.
When ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay overnight.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was in pain.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at that guy.
Will it hurt?
The girl was wearing a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who's Tom playing with?

What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane has crashed.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any friends in Indonesia?
You might have to help her.
Mary fainted.

Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You are photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hello", Tom said shyly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in a lot of pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
They're running.
The road doesn't match the number of cars that pass through it.
You seem to be afraid of my dog.
On the attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new sentence is like a message in a bottle: one day it will be translated.
You're not gonna get a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
You were loved by everyone.
We are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.

Where did you go skiing?
You were at the barber shop?
The prospect is depressing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ballpoint pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.

Don't look at me like that.
The road at this point bends to the right.

I'll never listen to you again.
I'm sure you do.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.

Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of himself.
How do we do that?

Don't let them in.
It's all in the cards.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.

I'm going back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog's yours.
What do you mean, "I'm sorry"?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to come by his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what's happened?
I didn't want to disturb him.
The officer was inspiring his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking of trying something similar right now.
I'm not much of a hunter.
This is the first time I've ever made grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You are a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom is about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I knew that already.
I never dated Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.

Tom should be home.
She was the one I thought she was.
Tom showed the police his driver's license.
I get my hair cut every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.

Bring your best game.
We take checks.
My bike is gone.
The stars were twinkling in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
"Hey, you're so boring". "Hey, my boy, this is the world everyone is looking for". "Here I am!" "Your Majesty, Ganon and his minions have taken Corridor Island". "Hmm. What can we do?" "As it is written, only the Link can defeat Ganon". "So what can we do?" "Hello! I'll grab my sword!" "No sword!" "No sword!" "Here's the one with the skull". "No sword!" "What about "Ah, Dad!"

It's gonna be up to him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our town was covered in smoke.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two large coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, food is not food.
It's going to snow tomorrow.
You should have quit smoking a long time ago.
Stop playing around!
Some of my classmates are complete noobs, they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like the bike?
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping.
Tom wasn't allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Please hurry! Tom is waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.
I know who we can turn to for help.
I'm stronger than you.
She felt deep regret, looking back on her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.
I really loved him.
Tom and I nodded in agreement.
In politics, respect is hard to earn, but easy to lose.
Stop acting like a child!

They start believing their own lies.
Don't pick him up.
Tom wants to dye his hair.

If your answer is right, then mine is not.
Are you sure Tom can do that?
F = ma  is a recording of Newton's second law.
What do you have against her?
He likes to sing.
I have some tails to clean up.
Is Tom all right?
I said yes.
Fortunately, Tom is much better today than he was yesterday.
I don't know much about Tom yet.
I can't pay him today.

You don't have to go.
Put him on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You're not using it, are you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
How long are you planning to stay?
We ate quickly and left immediately.
There is a big garden behind the house.
You are stubborn.
Be careful not to drop anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.

It had to be you.
Mary left her hat in my room.

She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you like to eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing that or not.
I'm going down.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
She learned to ride a bike last year.
Help us out here.

Have you ever had these symptoms?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say happened?

I don't have to put up with it.
Always give way to the right obstacle.

I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like the rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
You still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to be sorry about.

You are so impatient.
You said you wanted this.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?

Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my cutting knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You'll soon adjust to the country life.
Keep a bucket of water nearby.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.

Look at that cat.
I'm divorced now.
This is extremely interesting.

Is everybody having fun?
Tom is watching figure skating on TV.
We'll have to sleep outside tonight.
Did Tom show Mary how to do that?
It's amazing, isn't it?
I'm shrunk. I'm not sure.
The school is only five minutes' walk from here.
Tom put a spoon in his pocket.
Is that all you care about?
Do you see the rose?
Mary tried to hide her tears.
Self-confidence is the key to success.
I just want to be a good father.
I'll send you the link.
I lived in Japan three years ago.
How many other people know about this?
I got high.
We didn't meet in Paris.
Are there any volunteers?

Tom didn't say when he'd be here.
Tom likes you very much.
Can you do that for me?
There's a little I can do for you right now.
I'm here because I was asked to come.
A man was seen behaving suspiciously shortly before the explosion.
He's sitting with his legs crossed.
I definitely heard a scream.
Asakusa is full of foreign tourists.
I wrote this for Tom.
You're not married?
Tom must have been drunk.
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
He's not richer than me.
If only I could tell you!
She missed the train.
In summer I go to the sea, and in winter to the mountains.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
You know everything about me.
The old man lives alone.
You are so stupid.
He almost never gets angry.
You're a little tense.
I don't know how to do that.
What would make you happy?
I'll be here on Monday, Tom on Tuesday, and Mary on Wednesday.
Is it safe to eat raw eggs?
What's the height of the Empire State Building?
Hey, how are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary did anything illegal.
Unfortunately, that is true.
Can we lock this door?
I don't know what to say.
What are you all doing here?
The police arrested the robber.
Keep Tom in the dark.
I'm not going to school today.
You two come with me.
Tom drank red wine and Mary white.
I read the article.
It used to belong to them.
He doesn't even notice me.
He's a disgrace to the whole town.
You're not going to quit?
The pigeon was whining.
This is my favorite.
I don't think anyone noticed what Tom was doing.
I'm not gonna sell my soul.
This is not my house.
They should have moved fast.
I think you paid too much for that.
I'll take him.
I wanted to eat pizza.
She said she didn't want to sleep.
You don't have time.
You're above all of us.
I was born here.
I asked my boss to raise my salary.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused?
Could you walk me?
Mary covered her face with her hands.
What if he's wrong?
Tom is a little like his father.
We never talked about that.
I know what that means.
I should have acted quickly.
Mary said she'd do it herself.
Don't you remember how I told you all this?
These girls just want to have fun.
I spoke to the doctors in French.
Robots are used to make cars.
Tom was never very punctual.
Tom and Mary are asleep.
They were all amazed to see me there.
Drink to my health!
He cut himself yesterday.
The singer suddenly switches to falsetto.
You don't have a fever.
Thank you so much for that information.
I can't afford to buy a new bike, so I'll have to do with this old one.
Tom doesn't think there is life on Mars.
I can't stay here all day.
I became a lawyer to help people.
I went to see Dan.
I met him a few months ago.
These gloves belong to him.
She doesn't look more than sixty.
Can you trust her?
She's a talented singer.
I've done this many times.
Don't play poker with them.
Tom is very upset about something.
I'll call her right away.
I want to dedicate this song to Tom.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
Tom held the rope with both hands.
Tom doesn't pay attention to Mary.
Tom lives in the same building as me.
Don't blame others for your mistakes.
I thought Tom was coming to see us.
I never lied to her.
Tom burned his fingers on the stove.
They took her.
Mary could have done it if she'd tried.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go for lunch.
Can I have one too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his homework?
Tom likes oranges.
That's the current plan.
We want Tom to say yes.
I think about them all day.
I can't read or write.
How is Tom now?
Tom left on time.
Tom stayed there for a few days.
X-rays showed two broken fingers.
Tom said Mary was very hungry.
Tom should have gone there.
It was a fantastic day.
I said good night.
Try to escape.
Let's wait a while.
The law must be obeyed.
Tom made Mary wait a long time.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I'm doing this for the money.
We were just talking about you.
Excuse me, can I get the check?
I thought you'd laugh.
Mary put on two sweaters.
You'll understand when you see Tom.
I want to hire them.
I'm sure he's smart.
Which way should I go?
You were born there?
My hearing is not the same.
He said it was nine.
The butterfly flew.
There's no time for that.
Both of these suitcases are mine.
Prices are going up.
She's not wrong.
Today I'm finally going to tell Tom what I really think of him.
Don't be mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like to sing?
I like winter.
Show me her picture.
They trusted you.
He was born in America.
Tom doesn't think so, of course.
He called me just as I was about to go to bed.
If I can do it, so can you.
The sun was warming his skin.
Tom promised to come back.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
