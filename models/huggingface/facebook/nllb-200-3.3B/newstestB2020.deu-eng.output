Fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, the prefecture of Normandy said on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was on duty with about 200 firefighting vehicles.
The Fire Was Contained
The European Union has also adopted a new approach to the situation in the Middle East, with the United Nations declaring that the situation in the Middle East is worsening, and that the EU is not prepared to accept the new approach.
The plant employs around 400 people and has been the subject of headlines in the past, including in 2013 when a leak in the plant leaked methanethiol, causing the surrounding area to smell of rotten eggs.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing dog for 57 days
A Washington woman spent two months looking for her missing dog, and she quit her job to do it. The seven-year-old border collie ran out of a hotel room while on vacation in Montana. The dog was missing for 57 days, but Carole King didn't give up.
"It was horrible. I felt sick", Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left their dog, Katie, in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They searched for the animal, but to no avail.
The dog had panicked
Hoping that Katie might still be staying at the hotel, Carole King went to the reception desk. "The clerk said, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago,'" Carole King recalled to the Daily Inter Lake. "When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately.
With flyers and calls to Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope", Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call from a man who said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go", King recalled, according to the Daily Inter Lake. "The tears flowed. People stopped in their cars, and they kissed and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her".
German losses: machine guns disappear without trace
The Commission shall submit the following information to the European Parliament and to the Council:
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns.
The Bundeswehr has lost 39 guns, 39 parts of guns and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition since the beginning of 2014, according to a list of the Federal Ministry of Defense classified as a classified matter, reported by the Editorial Network Germany.
According to the paper from the office of the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 rounds of ammunition have been recovered so far. Among the weapons and weapon parts still missing are, among others, six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six signal pistols and two pistols of the type P8.
The extent of the loss of weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "alarming", said Martina Renner, a member of the Left Bundestag, and this was all the more so because little had been found during the investigation. The Left politician spoke of a "dirty balance sheet". Renner criticized the fact that it was not clear whether the missing ammunition included the one found in connection with the investigation against the suspected terrorist, Federal Army officer Franco A. "Although a supporter of A. was recently convicted for the possession of this ammunition", said Renner.
The oil tanker Stena Impero has left Iranian ports.
More than two months after being seized by Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday, according to ship-tracking data from Refinitiv, leaving the Iranian port of Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was supposed to have been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters for the time being, the shipping company said, pending an official announcement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on 19 July, accused of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker off the British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world's most important sea routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have been escalating in recent months. Merchant shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Merkel praises the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has paid tribute to the commitment of the people of the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago in the peaceful revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a celebration of the Thuringian CDU faction for the upcoming German Unity Day in Erfurt. The chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "The state security was taken by terror", she said.
Musk is aiming for a delivery record.
Tesla's quarter may be a record, despite a delivery boom, the electric car company recently posted losses.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a big boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The Commission has also proposed to extend the scope of the existing aid scheme to cover the costs of the new plant, which will be built in the area of the new plant.
Investors loved it: Tesla's stock went out of trading with a gain of over six percent, the biggest increase in the stock's price in nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered just over 95,000 cars, setting a new record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. To do this, he needs six-digit figures in the current and next quarters. The cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were also losses.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebellum prevents people from tickling themselves. This was found out by scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. In this case, progress was also made in the question of why children fight against tickling so fiercely, only to ask for more.
Finally, it was shown why the mere approach of a tickling hand triggered laughter even before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebellum that already triggers laughter when the tickling is expected.
The report said that previous research had shown that rats responded with "laughter" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans, and that this "laughter" was mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that was central to haptic processing.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
The researchers concluded that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - and therefore humans could not tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found in experiments on rats that laughter and the activity of the corresponding area of the cerebral cortex were suppressed during self-touch. This was also true when living things cleaned themselves. During the time of self-touch and tickling, the scientists had enhanced the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh.
But if self-touch and other people's touch occur at the same time, laughter is suppressed, too, which suggests that the rat brain simply cannot distinguish between self-touch and other people's touch, and the new findings suggest that humans cannot tickle themselves because self-touch activates a brake in the cerebellum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves, but in the experiment they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely, showing flight or stubborn fear, an ambivalence similar to that of children, and the ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral response similar to that of rats and humans.
Catastrophe averted: Fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which was considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, the prefecture of Normandy told AFP news agency on Friday.
The authorities said that no substances harmful to health had leaked out of the building, and that the samples taken did not give cause for concern, as prefect Pierre-Andr√© Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were asked to stay in their homes, buildings within 500 yards were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
The factory is owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett's Lubrizol.
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants.The plant belongs to the company Lubrizol, owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett, and is subject to the EU's Seveso directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical plant has been the subject of headlines in the past - for example, when a gas leak in 2013 leaked methanethiol and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first sitting of Parliament after the lifting of the moratorium on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country out of the EU on October 31 without a deal if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, it is unclear how he intends to achieve this.
Speaking of Cox, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country back together would have been to exit the EU". Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorandum of Oslo and Ut√∂ya attacks is revealed
More than eight years after the Oslo and Ut√∏ya attacks, which left 77 people dead, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday.
The project, designed by artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud, is now to be unveiled at the same venue - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
The right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo on July 22, 2011, and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers Party on the island of Ut√∂ya.
Iran releases British oil tankers
The UN General Assembly debate failed to resolve the Iran conflict, but now one problem has been solved: the British oil tanker Stena Impero, which was detained in Iran, has been able to put to sea again, and it may be a piece of the puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Rouhani.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, has returned to international waters after being released by Iranian authorities and is now en route to Dubai, according to Stena Bulk.
The Stena Impero has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now headed to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said Erik H√•nell, the ship's chief executive.
The Foreign Office in London called the seizure of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to preserve shipping and international law", it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard detained the tanker on 19 July on charges of violating the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, H√•nell said. They have behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and stressful situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to reunite them with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that the detention of the Stena Impero was a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar, where a supertanker carrying oil from Iran, which was supposedly destined for Syria, was chained in early July.
The European Union has been the first to take action against the use of chemical weapons in the Middle East, and the United States has been the first to take action against the use of chemical weapons in the Middle East.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world's most important waterways. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have been greatly heightened in recent months. Merchant shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
The US has been pressuring Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a more stringent and expanded agreement. Iran has so far resisted the pressure. The US has been pressuring Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country.
The Stena Impero dispute and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia have prompted the United States to work on a coalition to provide military protection for merchant shipping in the region.
The Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz to the UN General Assembly in New York, and with the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protecting powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India is the likely "war winner". In view of the punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign manufacturers in the People's Republic of China are forced to make adjustments. In a UBS survey, CEOs of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country cite India as one of the preferred alternatives. This is not only due to the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war, but also to the fact that India has a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, which seems to have been created to play a more important role in the global production of large-scale chains.
But now India itself has become Trump's focus. Dismissed by the White House as the "kingdom of tariffs", the US has withdrawn trade preferences on 2,000 products from the emerging country in early June. The US is charging India with prohibitive tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, liquor, motorcycles and more.
The trade war is a world map, but the friction with India is only a side issue. America also looks at the world's largest democracy through the lens of security policy. Delhi and Washington are united by concern about China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this backdrop, a wave of American tariffs against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who has just begun a second five-year term, is therefore likely to feel safe.
The problem lies elsewhere: the empirically-hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a hard time in the socialist Republic of India. Even under Modi. His reformist agenda is aimed mainly at the bureaucratic madness that stifled the entrepreneurial spirit in the multinational state for too long. Companies now receive faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for more rapid liquidation of bankrupt companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, India has improved a lot in the first five years of the Modi government. But this does not apply to trade policy. Inspired by the need to protect internationally competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi is the symbol of the energetic reformer who is radically renewing his country's economy. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what vocabulary pleases Western managers. In essence, the "India First" advocate never retreated from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the closing of their industries are among the progenitors of the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and briefly applaud this modest policy.
The funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French president Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported, citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will be held in the close family circle. A public funeral was scheduled for Sunday at the Invaliddom in Paris, according to media reports.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships .
The world championship was already in the goal, when the down-cooled Khalifa International Stadium played out in the heating scenes. In the first preliminary round of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to waver dangerously. He could hardly hold himself on his feet 300 meters before the finish line, running in an unhealthy posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undercame him and dragged him to the last half of the stadium round to the finish line. The strength was enough for both of them to stop the armrake running through the finish line. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same", said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly drew the attention of the gathered journalists. He was shy at first, did not want to talk about his heroic deed at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he would not have even been able to start. "That's why I am proud to run here for my country", he said.
He did it with a lot of force that night, and with a lot more intensity than he would have thought, because this heroic act will be remembered, especially since Dabo even let his rival Busby take the lead in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won that preliminary. It was all for nothing in the end, because Busby, who only came to the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Athletics Federation for that very reason.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies in Lisbon, was competing to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, he managed to do it with 18:10.87 minutes, but he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes". However, only in training, since best times do not count.
Millions march: Egyptians prepare for a day of violent protests
Security measures in Egypt have been tightened in anticipation of possible anti-government protests.In the center of Cairo, a police presence was observed on Friday.Several subway stations remained closed, and roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
In recent days, police have stepped up their street checks and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, hundreds of people took part in protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansoura against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has been criticized for corruption and mismanagement. Egypt has not seen such an open protest against the political leadership for years. Egyptian entrepreneur and actor Mohammed Ali, who lives in exile in Spain and started demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million march" on central squares in the country on Friday. Ali calls for a "popular revolution".
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise, according to two monitoring groups: the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday; the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported more than 2,000 arrests; these figures were not independently confirmed initially; the government did not confirm or comment on the figures either.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW said, citing lawyers for those arrested. According to their lawyers, the charges against those arrested range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist organization". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, uniformed security forces, as well as civilian-clad security forces, interrogated and searched passers arbitrarily, HRW said.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, which has seen the government in Cairo block websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: easing the way for retailers to donate returns
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods, resulting in about 20 million returns that end up in the trash.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies cannot be exempted from sales tax on donations in kind, the ministry said in response to a question from the Green Party parliamentary group, which was reported by the newspapers of the Funke media group on Friday.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg have found that German citizens return one out of every six packages ordered on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - end up in the garbage. Under current law, donating them would cost companies additional money, because the financial authorities evaluate donations in kind as sales, which are then subject to sales tax.
The Green leader Katrin G√∂ring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to issue a decree to clarify that companies can value unsold products accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations.
Banksy art auction: there's never been a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of street-art star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is due to be auctioned off soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work highlights "the return of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy to the animal and tribal basic attitude". The painting is due to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital from Saturday until its auction on 3 October.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of the UK, where Banksy lives, and was re-exhibited in 2009 to coincide with the original Brexit date of 29 March, when the work was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The painting could change hands for a million dollars.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover the whole of the European Union, including the European Union's accession to the European Union, and to extend the scope of the directive to cover the whole of the European Union.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has been involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in the south-east of England, he painted a picture of a man who uses a chisel to break a star of the European flag. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the work every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a walk in the park
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on anti-Brexit members of Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday. "We're enjoying it. We're going to get out (of the EU) and we're going to win".
Johnson had attacked opponents of Brexit in parliament in recent days, accusing them of "treason" against the people, among other things. He dismissed as "a hoax" accusations that he could put the MPs in danger because they could become the target of death threats.
The only way to restore calm, Cummings said, was if MPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU.
In the face of the heated atmosphere, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect", said one statement. "And we should listen".
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
In an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, has again called for the UN to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
In the event of a new war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India, Khan said Friday at the UN General Assembly debate in New York. "If it goes bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst". The United Nations has a responsibility for Kashmir.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. In early August, India had stripped the Indian region of Kashmir of its autonomy, thus increasing tensions with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is responding with a hard hand to the current protests in Egypt. It is firing live ammunition at the population, over 2,000 prisoners are joining the 60,000 political prisoners who are already serving time in prisons. Protests have never been safe in Egypt. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything possible to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring.
But one of the things that triggered the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation, the poverty, the lack of perspective, the feeling of being suffocated by your own government, which drove millions into the streets, and this is a problem that even the Sisi regime, no matter how hard it is against opponents, cannot control, and it has actually gotten worse.
Today, one in three Egyptians live below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, and the inflation rate is at 10 percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who you want to finance: Nestl√©, Coca-Cola, or the military. The latter is not only responsible for repression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, and this dilemma is also an old one in the supermarket. It becomes critical when large sections of the population have difficulty affording a bottle of water at all.
BER chief: No more 'showstoppers' for the capital airport
The complex network of BER fire protection systems has been tested for two months to see if it works together.
After large-scale T√ºv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control board.
Airport manager Engelbert L√ºtke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there were still deficiencies in the terminal to be worked out. "We have many details, but we do not have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
The construction work is to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 and the building permit is to be submitted to the building authority, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of electrical cable defects are still to be addressed, and T√ºv intends to test them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work on the defects must continue", said a written statement.
L√ºtke Daldrup said that in many cases it was a matter of lack of evidence, less of new cables, and that there was no clearance for all the cables on which the cable trusses were attached.
The fire protection system at the railway station crossing under the terminal is not working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke screens, which are closed like a canvas in case of a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there should be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
The airport was originally scheduled to open in 2011, but fire safety issues, construction problems and planning errors delayed the opening of the airport for years, and the cost has risen from two billion euros since construction began in 2006 to an estimated 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the airport authorities are planning to expand the airport.
The airport is now looking for two new managers. Heike F√∂lster, the head of finance, will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, and Manfred Bobke-von Camen, the head of personnel, will retire next year, as Bretschneider said.
Chemnitz: Police arrested man after drug vending machines were blown up
He needed money for drugs and blew up several machines in the Chemnitz area!
In the last two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply, causing a million-dollar damage!
After two explosions at the end of May in the B√ºrgerstra√üe and in the Furtherstra√üe in Chemnitz, the police arrested a 33-year-old German.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the introduction of explosive explosions in the Tate unit with a particularly serious case of theft, which was conducted by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion was confirmed against the 33-year-old".
Faced with new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer has now confessed to eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently used the loot to finance his drug addiction". The bomber had blown up parking meters on B√ºrgerstra√üe four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage caused is at least ‚Ç¨60,000!
The suicide bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation is continuing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for other automatic explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA to take over Eurowings from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. Amid the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA will take over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", a spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed to APA on Friday.
The Vienna base of Lufthansa's Eurowings passenger jetliner is thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "wet season", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in the future, which are to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter planes to holiday destinations.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, the spokesman explained.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna is only a "production company" for the group's sister AUA. Barcelona and Rome, among others, would be served with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings equipment. The onboard product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings.
The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would increase its fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer.The Irish low-cost airline is sending four Ryanair aircraft with crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a circumvention of the collective agreement.
The campaign rhetoric of Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years, was countered on Friday by AUA chief executive Andreas Otto: "We will remain the number one location in five, six or ten years".
The Queen's granddaughter, Princess Beatrice, is engaged to be married.
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: When they were children, the cousins were best friends. Now marry the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
The palace announced on Thursday that during their holiday in Italy earlier this month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 34, reportedly proposed to his girlfriend, Princess Beatrice, 31.
"We are extremely excited to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to begin this adventure together and can't wait to be actually married", the couple, who have been together since October 2018, according to British media reports, said in the official announcement.
And he goes on to say, "We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will help us greatly in the years ahead, full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie took the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also posted on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is set to take place in 2020, and details of the date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the wedding of the ninth in line to the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a similarly big party as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study of the causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, poor diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but what really triggers heart failure or a heart attack?
By analysing the genetic material of 9,000 people, scientists in Hamburg and Switzerland are trying to discover the causes of cardiovascular disease in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) said on Friday.The K√ºhne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros.
The researchers are now looking to compare the complete genetic material of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Centre at UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes have known of possible disease-causing changes in their DNA - so-called mutations - and about 200 are being added each year, the clinic said.
The aim of the five-year project, according to the initiators, is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks.The data could also be useful in the research of other folk diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Cardiovascular Centre.New insights into the interaction between the heart and the brain, the heart and the kidneys and cancer are possible.
The chairman of the K√ºhne Foundation, Klaus-Michael K√ºhne (82), also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The foundation's clinic in Davos deals mainly with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created. In justifying his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on three years ago in Hamburg on an open heart and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers who are also taking part in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world according to the clinic. The encryption of the genetic material strictly respects the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital of Zurich.
The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on October 1, and all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian Police Free Hundreds of Abused Children
In Nigeria, police freed more than 300 boys from a Koranschool who had been tortured and abused. Following reports from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were minors, said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught the Koran and "improved", but in fact the boys were held by their teachers in "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", Sabo said.
The Koranschool had reportedly been in existence for about ten years. Residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the establishment. Parents had shown shock when they were informed about the conditions in the Koranschool, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koranic schools, which replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, over 40,000 people have fled across the border into the neighboring state of Niger in the past 10 months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police rescue 400 children from school
Police officers have rescued nearly 400 students from horrendous conditions at a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that suggest torture", said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children were discovered on Thursday in an Islamic school, where conditions were "inhumane", officials said, arresting the school's headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held in their schools like slaves and chained, some sexually abused, and television images showed emaciated and injured students in obviously poor health.
The European Union is a global player in the world of football.
Football "Signature not valid"
J√ºrgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe were awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After the Nicaraguan captain declared that he had never voted in the World Cup, other countries are blaming FIFA. Egypt was not considered at all - with a curious reason.
Many things have been discredited at FIFA in recent years: the World Cup bids, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. The FIFA World Player Election has not yet been suspected of being unfair - if you exclude the fact that the national coaches and national team captains of the member associations who are entitled to vote often vote on sympathy rather than on objective assessment.
But after the Nicaraguan captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, other inconsistencies were revealed: Egypt complained that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
FIFA apologises for the fact that "the signatures on the voting forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid" and that it contacted the Egyptian federation several times to clarify the situation - without any response.
Sudan's coach also surprised
The Sudanese Football Association (SFA) has also expressed concern over the vote, but while the situation in Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Football Association (SFA) has stated that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was ultimately expected: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second and Sadio Man√© in third.
The Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera also made accusations: "Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details of my vote are wrong, thank you", he wrote.
The statement came Friday from the association: "The election documents were filled in by mistake and were signed by Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan team, but the choice was actually made by the second captain Manuel Rosas. We take responsibility for the administrative error", the statement said. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte voted for Messi, "as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases are being investigated by FIFA, but the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
Ukraine: Republican leaders call for an official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly called for an official investigation of US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important", said Republican Governor of Vermont Phil Scott. "Where it goes from here will be determined by the facts that are established". He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had revealed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower scandal, but few have expressed any discomfort about it. Scott's comments are now the first indication of this in Trump's party.
Another senior Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, also spoke out in favor of the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation", Baker said. "The right course of action and the responsibility of Congress now is to investigate and get to the bottom of it".
Scott and Baker, as governors of states, have no formal say in the case against Trump, which is being decided in Congress. Their comments are therefore primarily symbolically important. However, first Republican senators have also expressed criticism of the situation. Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, too deeply disturbing". US media also reported that the first rifts were appearing among the Republicans.
The affair could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump, with Democrats in the House of Representatives announcing an investigation into the alleged abuse of power by foreign powers to influence Trump for political gain.
There is no specific timetable for impeachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could attempt a so-called impeachment. The decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. No US president has ever been removed from office by impeachment proceedings.
Were there any torturers on board Rackete's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for allegedly raping and murdering people in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain, Carola Rackete (31), was arrested in June after she illegally entered the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyan refugees on board.
Now new serious accusations against rackets are being made. Three men, who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps, may have arrived in Italy on the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information about it", said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country - Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24) - had been raped, tortured and even murdered.
NGOs and aid agencies now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports", Neugebauer said. "Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. It is therefore very important that this is followed up".
Italy's right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini demanded an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk is aiming for a Tesla delivery record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a big boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The company said that the demand was strong enough for Tesla to have 110,000 orders, and the challenge was to get the cars to customers quickly, so Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors loved it: Tesla's stock went up by over six percent, the biggest increase in nearly four months, and in the second quarter, Tesla delivered 95,000 cars, setting a new record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be obtained in the current and next quarter. Mostly the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
The US budget dispute: only one more bridge financing
The new fiscal year in the US will begin on 1 October without a regular budget.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States is once again without spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year beginning on October 1.The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and passed a continuing resolution (CR) until November 21.
Shutdown averted
The federal government is being funded at the same level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 that ends on Monday, because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending bills that will allocate funds to the various departments and agencies, and the federal government cannot benefit from the expanded spending cap for the new fiscal year from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve bills in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. But the spending bills reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending bills more or less ready, which are barely able to have a majority.
The Republicans in the Senate are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the wall, one of President Trump's top priorities. Democrats are concerned about the wall and its funding, which is actually for other military buildings and projects. The controversy over the wall escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
‚ô™ The walls are where the ghosts are ‚ô™
The Commission has already set up a working group on the implementation of the new rules on the financial sector, which will be composed of representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission.
In light of the ongoing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending bills in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process are gaining popularity.S. 1877 to prevent shutdowns would automatically continue funding the federal government at the previous year's level, suspending the travel of members of Congress and withholding their salaries until the new annual spending plans are in place.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination is to be made available to single women and lesbians: the National Assembly in Paris voted overwhelmingly in favour of a government bill allowing all women to have access to in vitro fertilization, which is expected to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still needs Senate approval, but critics on the right have warned that in the future many "children without fathers" could grow up.
The new regulation is the core of a bioethics law, which the Minister of Health, Agn√®s Buzyn, defended as an "opportunity" for society.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband still prohibited
The Commission's proposal to amend the directive on the protection of the environment by the placing on the market of products containing harmful substances and to amend the directive on the protection of the health of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens and mutagens is not acceptable.
Many members of the ruling party La R√©publique en Marche (Republic on the Move) of President Emmanuel Macron and opposition MPs, on the other hand, had spoken in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be subject to a 'double mourning' if her husband's death also meant that her desire for children was not fulfilled.
The initiators of the now-failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can in future be fertilised with the sperm of a stranger but not with that of her own partner.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the rules on the protection of the environment are respected, and that the Commission is prepared to take action to ensure that the rules on the protection of the environment are respected.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for a levy on universities are growing
The universities are flying a lot, so the country wants to have a climate tax there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The European Commission has proposed a new directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens.
The discussion on a climate levy on flights by universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum again. After the state rectors' conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-W√ºrttemberg universities and a pedagogical college plead for compensation for business flights. This is "urgently necessary" as a first step, at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, it says in its opinion. The original plan in the July cabinet is on hold for the time being, because the CDU has not yet clarified the situation of the Green.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB, the arrested men were illegally fishing in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen had been arrested. At that time, there was an exchange of gunfire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no injuries, it was said.
The North Korean fishermen were reportedly in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian coast guard is said to be patrolling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
The Commission has also been asked to provide information on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment, and to provide a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment.
The Russian fisheries authority had also failed to issue fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, following complaints from local entrepreneurs.
Georgi Martynow, the head of the Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorye, recently complained about the environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen who use narrow mesh synthetic nets, which are banned in Russia, to catch small creatures from the sea, and also to throw the nets into the sea, where they take 200 years to decompose.
The EU has a long history of supporting the poor and the underprivileged.
The "greatest nation in history", Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials at the White House.
The world's richest country is closing its doors to asylum seekers: the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms that the legal refugee ceiling is being further reduced, with the aim of granting asylum to the most vulnerable believers and Iraqis.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at most 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department stated. In the now almost expired fiscal year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the number of asylum seekers from around the world in recent years, and the previous administration of Barack Obama had imposed much higher admission limits.
The targeted cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980, yet the State Department called the US "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a phrase that strongly resembles the language of the incumbent US president.
The EU's "responsible approach" to refugees is to allow them to return to their home countries to help rebuild, Trump said.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selensky affair and a possible threatened impeachment proceedings.
The US government intends to focus on two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have been put in danger, according to the State Department statement.
The United States wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular seek asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has signed migration agreements first with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orang-utans from zoo
The animal was taken on a direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andr√©s Gil Dom√≠nguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms human ape is unable to adapt to life in the wild, it will live in the future in the enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", former pets of pop star Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, "Sandra" must still undergo a quarantine of about 40 days in Sedgwick County in Zoo Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 lawsuit for "Sandra" by animal rights activists has helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education center for the preservation of biodiversity is to be created there.
Swiss record for extreme climbing: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Extreme climber Dani Arnold has won a new horse race on the almost 3,000-meter-high Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double-floor or other means, the Swiss overcame the 550-meter-high north wall of the Great Quarter in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, a T-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb the mountain, beating the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the Free Solo Speed record holder at four of the six major northern European circuits.
Nike is benefiting from new online marketing strategy
The US sportswear manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion (almost 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter, which is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the group announced on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three months to the end of August, with Nike's sales rising the most in China, up 22 percent, and the Beaverton, Oregon-based company also benefited in the People's Republic of China from its approach to direct-to-consumer marketing via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to drive the sportswear maker's "digital transformation" with strategic investments, thus increasing its competitive advantage.
Life-long stadium ban because of racism in Italy
Brazilian defender Jesus was insulted by the fan on Instagram, and Jesus posted the private messages and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am", wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Roma since 2016.
The club responded late on Thursday, reporting the fan's account to Instagram and the police, and saying the Roma fan should never attend a club game again, the club tweeted.
"We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. Those responsible must be identified and thrown out of the stadiums", said FIFA president Gianni Infantino at the weekend.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 fans of record-breaking Juventus Turin from entering the stadium, four of them for a period of ten years, the police said.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against 12 leaders of ultra-fan groups in the Juventus environment, accused of, among other things, severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence.
The Ultra leaders are said to be behind the black market in tickets, according to Italian media reports, and they "militarily controlled" the ticket sales for the fan curve, and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole generations are given names that are catchy, but if you look closely, the labels are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the way young people feel about life?
"The Crab is Coming!" This call officially launched the Gucheng Lake Crab Catching in Gaochun on September 21, and the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern outskirts of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in ecological terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields".
The people of Gaochun started to raise crab in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a major industry that generated high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as a technology-based crab farming.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services", and carefully built the service network for "authorization under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network of services, a platform for lending", in order to comprehensively optimize the environment for permitting, services, and development.
Gaochun is taking full advantage of the local advantages of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and is using the development zone and its status as an international "Slow City" as a flagship to attract high-end intelligent manufacturing enterprises, biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, culture and health enterprises, and ecological agriculture enterprises, which are leaders in the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism zone covering all areas and types of tourism of national importance. Gaochun has further enhanced the ecological and cultural resources of the countryside of Gaochun, the state of the citizen services and public services for the future, and has developed the "+2" tourism to the "+2" level, and has been able to develop the "tourism" to the "+2" level.
Iran-US conflict: Rouhani says sanctions will end - Trump says otherwise
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has spoken of a supposed US offer to lift sanctions after returning from the UN General Assembly, saying the United States had offered to end all sanctions in exchange for talks with Tehran's leadership, Rouhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift sanctions against him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no".
"And America says, 'I will lift the sanctions,'" Ruhani added. "The type of punitive measures that should be lifted was up for debate, and they said clearly, 'We will lift all sanctions.'"
The EU's position on the issue of the EU's role in the world of the media is that the EU should be able to play a more active role in the world of the media, and that the EU should be able to play a more active role in the world of the media.
The European Union's Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York earlier this week in the hope of saving the nuclear deal with Iran, which was negotiated with Russia and China.
A major earthquake near Istanbul - nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes shook western Turkey in a short period of time, fears of a catastrophe are mounting: 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday, and nearly 200 aftershocks have occurred since the previous day's quake, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, raising fears of a catastrophe.
The Turkish government has announced that it will appoint a commission to prepare the country for future earthquakes, Oktay said.The 5.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the Marmar region outside Istanbul on Thursday has caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Turkey has not been adequately prepared for earthquakes for the past 20 years, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The city itself has repeatedly ignored the latent danger. Each year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - including many that are destroyed by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as renowned architect M√ºcella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces registered as places of refuge in the center have long since been built.
The epicentre of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara off the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometers, according to the disaster management agency Afad.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tweeted that no injuries or damage had been reported initially, state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of their homes in panic, students were evacuated from buildings in the Silivri district for safety reasons, and some students were crying as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake-prone. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian fault, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is rocked by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers are worried that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when it will happen is unclear.
Companies are designing emergency plans, individuals have ready-packed go-bags with all the necessary supplies at home, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people were injured, some buildings suffered minor damage, and Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was monitoring the developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom), which said two minarets of mosques collapsed in Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social media, many users are reporting panic, with buildings shaking, schools and hospitals evacuated, phone lines down, and more than Tuesday's strongest, one user wrote.
The time of the earthquake is officially given as 1:59 p.m. (local time), but according to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first quake, there was a aftershock that was given a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
The earthquake was felt as far as Istanbul, Turkey, on Tuesday, after a 4.6-magnitude quake struck the Marmara region, whose epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis of millions, the disaster management authority Afad said Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later, a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high, and scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
"These could be the signs of a bigger earthquake", Ersoy told CNN T√ºrk. "Sooner or later the big one will come".
The European Union is also concerned about the situation in the Balkans, where the Turkish authorities have been unable to provide adequate support for the victims of the earthquake.
Parliament: New fuel in the Ukraine affair
Two documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment process, US Democrats are emboldened: The complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous whistleblower and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president provide important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself more than once as a victim of a "witch hunt". He also questioned the credibility of the whistleblower.
United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - flight diverted
A United Airlines flight was diverted because a passenger was trapped in the onboard toilet, according to US media, after the toilet door was blocked on Flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco.
The woman was finally rescued from the cramped cabin on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, where she was trapped for about an hour, according to U.S. media, citing other passengers.
A video that has been circulating on the Internet, and which US media claim is from Flight 1554, shows several people trying to free the woman. "We're working on opening the door now, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man. The airline has apologized to all the passengers. It was not clear at first whether the woman will receive compensation.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He's writing a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous short story "The Transformation", British bestselling author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" will be published in German on November 27, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) reported. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now suddenly the most powerful man in Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to translate the will of the people into action and is fiercely determined to let nothing and no one stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying, "When parliament is shut down so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers are lying shamelessly like Soviet leaders used to, when Brexiteers in high places are bringing about the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to that: write".
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, tells of Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning to find himself "turned into a monstrous insect", gradually excluded from family and society, and finally destroyed. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands on its head", the Diogenes Publishing House said.
EU invests ‚Ç¨9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are being fitted with whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains, and sections of the railway lines between Graz and Gy√∂r and between Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are being modernised and electrified.
The EU authorities say this will make traveling more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until October 31, 2019, a day after its bankruptcy filing.
The company also said that bookings of Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, √ñGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or fully paid, were affected.
The German company Thomas Cook, which is part of the Neckermann Reisen, √ñger Tours and Bucher Reisen group, employs some 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to start sending money to hotels now.
However, as of this Friday, hotels abroad that are currently hosting Thomas Cook holidaymakers will receive money from Zurich insurance.
Based on the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travellers are not immediately asked by these hotels to pay individual hotel invoices or otherwise be coerced", spokesman Bernd Engelien said.
The insurance company was reacting to reports from hotel guests who said they had been forced to pay for their accommodation on site, with some having to pay more than ‚Ç¨1000.
The Commission has also decided to initiate a procedure under Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the granting of a licence to a shipbuilder for the purpose of carrying out a shipbuilding project in the port of Zurich.
The insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The newly announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance will only help travelers who are currently on the move, however, and the outlook is bad for Thomas Cook customers who are still planning to fly for their holidays.
The company left open the status of trips starting from 1 November 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it was said. Basically, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has been stopped.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by Kaera.Customers could find out on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and could claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys landmines in Angola
Prince Harry has long carried on the legacy of Lady Diana, and in Africa he is now following in his mother's footsteps.
Wearing a blue flak vest, Britain's Prince Harry has set off and destroyed a land mine in Angola.
The incident took place on Friday morning in front of a live TV camera near a camp of the British Halo Trust near Dirico, and the device exploded in the savannah, without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his Africa tour, Harry wanted to walk in the city of Huambo, directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997), with the same bombmaster who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to follow the path she took.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been on a ten-day African tour since Monday, which started in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
The EU is also a major player in the EU's energy sector.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that he would not be the one to guarantee a third delay in the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made by polarizing Britons for a long time. The latest ruling by the Supreme Court in the UK is like a sword of Damocles hovering over the blonde's head. His suspension of Parliament to be able to carry out his Brexit course stubbornly until the exit date was annulled earlier this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks until October 31 in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However, Johnson had always categorically ruled this out.
Boris Johnson still thinks a deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to have gone away on Johnson, who has hinted during a visit to a hospital that he would support extending the negotiations until the end of October if the agreement is not signed:
You know, we're gonna follow the law.
But at the same time, we are confident that we will be leaving the EU by 31 October.
And I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And the time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators have about six weeks to prevent a British exit from the European Union without an agreement. But the recent talks have not achieved a breakthrough either. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new postponement of the exit date is in force. The opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this connection, the US health authority CDC said. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have been more than 900 cases, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage has been reported in Europe. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared millions of times online, with the Spanish-based construction contractor and actor calling for a "people's revolution" and calling for more protests on Friday against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement.
The security authorities are on high alert. In central Cairo, a heavy police presence was already observed. Several subway stations remained closed, and streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. In recent days, police have increased their road controls and searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, hundreds of people took part in protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansoura, the first such open protests in Egypt in years. The security forces reacted with similar force. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since last week, many of them arbitrarily - simply because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW said, citing lawyers for the detainees.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country, with the government in Cairo blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi, who has ruled the country since 2013 after ousting the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday, and was greeted at the port of Hamburg by among others the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic on the racing yacht "Malizia".
In recent months, Fuchs and a team of scientists have been exploring and documenting the effects of global warming on the seaboard of his sailing vessel, the Dagmar Aaen, off the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, the polar researcher said. He has waited for years for the young generation to speak. We have known for decades that the earth is warming. Yet many acted as if there was a Planet B.
"What happens at sea is often behind closed doors", said Fuchs, who and his team wanted to educate people about the effects of global warming and marine pollution, including drones that have been used to scour Greenland's glacier ice and nets used to fish for microplastics.
"For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example", said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades".
Spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
Two Japanese tourists found the price of two plates of spaghetti and fish at a modest restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome to be too much.
"These cases are damaging to the reputation of Rome, and we are asking the police to investigate whether this is a fraud", said a spokesman for Federagit, the association of tourist guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The restaurant owner's reaction was immediate. The Japanese had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the owner of the restaurant justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the hostess said.
A phone call in Ukraine and everything is ruined? US President Donald Trump could actually be facing impeachment proceedings after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to test this as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - it's a matter of weeks before a decision would be made.
The beginning of the scandal is supposedly the phone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who finally made the conversation public out of concern for the national security and for the democracy of the USA with his complaint, is monstrous: the President abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He exploited the dependence of Ukraine in blackmailing and thus forced them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not give the full text. The July 25 phone call is only one episode of a much larger story, in which Trump is the center of his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story, from the public's point of view, begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports about Rudy Giuliani's plans to travel to Ukraine to meet with the newly elected President Zelensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation that we have the right to", he tells the newspaper. "It may seem inappropriate, but there is nothing illegal about it". Giuliani wants investigations to be conducted in Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very helpful to my client and could turn out to be very helpful to my government".
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that have been fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to create a pretext for the Russia investigation in the US.
The investigation is precisely the one that Trump will be talking about so prominently on the phone with Zelensky in July. Giuliani and the president's version is that former vice president and currently a promising candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration's Ukraine adviser, pushed for the dismissal of then-Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin in order to stop the investigation he was in charge of into the gas company, whose board of directors included his son, Hunter Biden, senior, and that Biden had extorted money from Ukraine to cover up his family's corrupt dealings.
In fact, the process was somewhat different: when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, but Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Moreover, Shokin was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was far from the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disruptions to Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media is down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are especially affected. On the website allest√∂rungen.de users report that Facebook has not been loading since about 3:30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not so far to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more likely to be affected by disruptions
This is not the first major disruption this year, with services having been down for several hours in March and July, and as in previous cases, users are turning to Twitter to air their grievances.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force. They were traveling in a lifeboat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour was needed for the Chilean rescue helicopter to rescue them.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we got the message, at 10 minutes past ten we started, and 20 minutes later we were over the lifeboat".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER be charged without a cable
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technique via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
With the recent launch of several new smartphones that support wireless charging and sell very well - the new iPhone 11 models in particular - we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July.
Higher temperature is killing the battery.
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. This is extremely harmful to the devices according to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up within three hours to 27 degrees. With wireless charging, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees even with perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is located next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives up the power consumption.
Capacity and service life
The researchers say that the temperature is a decisive factor in the battery's durability. Each degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also lasts less overall. The lifespan is therefore shorter. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery change in modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this may be a helpful tip. According to Apple, the cost of a battery change has recently increased even once again - and that is for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a suitable charging pad - these are now installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without the hassle of cable wiring and a tedious plug finger. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transfer) is a worldwide standard, which, exceptionally, even Apple is involved, there are few restrictions.
Everest Stau photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the world's 14 highest mountains in just six months, setting a record for the highest person to reach the summit of Manaslu in Nepal, Nirmal Purja, 36, said his expedition's organizer.
Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: a photo of climbers queuing on Mount Everest went viral in spring.
The image of the mass exodus sparked a debate about increased security measures on the 8,848-meter mountain, the world's highest peak, where eleven climbers died in May in a few days.
Purja's challenge to climb the 14th eight-thousanders may be a problem: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the ascent of the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet, citing bad weather among other reasons.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
A pregnant elephant cow was among the dead animals, a police spokesman said Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned".
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and popular rock fortress of Sigiriya, and the police spokesman said the animals were believed to be between 15 and 25 years old, and an autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year, often by farmers whose land the animals used to live on harmlessly, and about 50 people are killed by elephants each year, mostly when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
Sri Lanka is estimated to have only about 7,000 elephants left, and killing them is theoretically punishable by death.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas, more than two months after it was docked by Iran, the maritime authority of Bandar Abbas announced, according to the news agency IRNA.
The management of Thomas Cook in the criticism
The House of Commons's economic affairs committee is set to investigate the collapse of travel giant Thomas Cook, including the salary packages of its board of directors and the question of why the British government has not given financial support to the struggling company. "We are interested in the supervision of the company as well as the control by external auditors", said Rachel Reeves, the committee chairwoman, in London.
Experts say that genes are overestimated in the risk of colorectal cancer
The role of genes in the familial increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion of researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are therefore likely to be more serious than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colon cancer, emphasize the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk is pushing Tesla's stock to the top
In an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek", Musk wrote that demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular said.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, and to do that, Tesla needs to provide as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the news: Tesla shares were up more than six percent, the biggest increase in nearly four months, and the company delivered 95,000 cars in the second quarter, setting a new record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, in the current and next quarter six-digit figures must be obtained. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses in the end.
The UK government wants to bypass Brexit law?
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not sure whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law recently passed by Parliament to prevent a no-deal Brexit, but he told reporters on Friday that his government would abide by the law.
The law provides that the government must request a delay in the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had on Thursday suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, using a procedural trick to delay the entry into force of the law until after the UK leaves the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a deal with the European Union. "We are confident of leaving the EU on 31 October and the best way is to leave is with a deal".
Iran apparently ramping up uranium enrichment
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European partners in the dispute over the salvation of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states are showing an inability or unwillingness to take concrete action", Rouhani told a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday, and said that if they did not live up to their promises, "further steps" away from the agreements of the 2015 hard-won deal would be possible.
The US withdrew from the deal in 2018 in order to force Iran to change course in what it considered to be an aggressive Middle East policy with "maximum pressure". The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now back on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded by resuming the enrichment of uranium limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing to use the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium.
The European Union is also calling for the EU to take action to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme is implemented in a way that is consistent with the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia, which he says are not part of the Iran-Contra alliance.
However, the situation has changed after an attack on an important oil facility in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the UK followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack.
"Those who make such accusations must present evidence", said Rouhani, which European leaders did not know during their talks with him at the UN General Assembly, but instead said that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out such an attack.
The EU's foreign minister, Hassan Rouhani, said that the US administration's wide-ranging sanctions must be lifted before talks with US President Trump could take place.
Comet from another star crosses solar system
Astronomers are observing a comet from deep in space, and it's the first time they've done that, and it's leading to clues about other solar systems.
What was once just a guess has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest is passing through our solar system, the comet from deep space has been named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has sparked the interest of astronomers around the world.
The most distant comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations by various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be observed during a transit of our solar system, after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get close-up views of an alien solar system before it disappears forever. Early observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those in our own solar system, as reported by the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun at this distance", said Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency NASA in a statement.
The comet is in a hyperbolic orbit, which leads it out of our system, and is clearly of interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar comet, which was initially listed under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was designated 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was observed on approach, giving researchers many months to study it. "The object will reach its maximum brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
The comet was first observed by the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, which determined that the comet was between 2 and 16 kilometers in diameter, and that the comet was moving in a direction that was not previously known.
Researchers from the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias (IAC) have already obtained the first spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which provides a fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar", reported IAC researcher Julia de Lic√≥n.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to study certain processes in other solar systems.
The agency plans to station the three-piece Comet Interceptor probe on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028, either on a fresh, untouched comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua, according to ESA's science director G√ºnther Hasinger.
The first landing at Beijing's new mega-airport, Daxing
Just in time for the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, the first passenger plane of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega-airport south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
The new airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers annually by 2022, and 72 million by 2025, according to the Chinese President Xi Jinping, who personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project.
The complex has four runways, later to be extended to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automated air traffic management system.
The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 and is much smaller, has been repeatedly postponed.
New hypersonic aircraft to fly from London to Sydney in four and a half hours by 2030
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is the UK Space Agency's dream. A special propulsion system (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by Oxfordshire-based Reaction Engines is to make this supersonic flight possible in the 2030s, reported CNN. "This is the technology that could definitely do it", said agency chief Graham Turnock. "We're talking about the 2030s for entry into service, and the work is very advanced".
The British space agency is working closely with the Australian space agency to advance the project. A flight from the British capital to the Australian capital currently takes about 20 hours. The only supersonic passenger aircraft to date, the Concorde, had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until its discontinuation in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", Reaction Engines writes on its homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that is five times faster than the speed of sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, thus enabling the "next generation of truly reusable frame vehicles".
Trump wants to track down anonymous whistleblowers in Ukraine
In the Ukraine affair over the possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information", Trump told staff at the U.S. Embassy to the United Nations in New York on Thursday, calling the person involved almost "a spy" and saying that in the past, the way people dealt with such people was "a little different" than today.
The event was not public, but several US media outlets distributed audio clips of the speech on Friday, and Democrats reacted angrily to the president's statement.
Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday that they were preparing to impeach Trump. Their accusations were based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who made serious allegations against Trump and his administration.
In the course of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government employees that the US president is "using the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in the US 2020 election in his favor.
The allegations center on a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in late July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate matters that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, including the former dealings of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of a cover-up in connection with the Ukraine phone call: senior government officials had made an effort to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the covers. As usual, an electronic transcript was prepared. This was removed from a customary database by White House lawyers after the conversation, but instead was stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough transcript of the conversation has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, but the New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
On Friday, Trump again questioned the credibility of the source, tweeting that the so-called whistleblower had leaked second-hand information that turned out to be false, and that there may be no tip-offers or spies.
The president's comments in New York about those who leaked information to the whistleblower sparked outrage, and the speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted with concern, complaining that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting investigations into Trump and his entourage for months now, and in light of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with new vigour with investigations to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a road map for our investigation", said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff, accusing him of misrepresenting the facts, and again demanding the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly berates Schiff, and had already called for his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials in the fields of security and foreign policy, many of them under Democratic and Republican presidents, said in a statement released Friday that they supported the investigation by the Democrats into possible impeachment proceedings, which, if true, would be "a brazen abuse of power" by Trump.
There is no exact timetable for the next procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. No US president has yet been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW works council: jobs are being "sneakily" cut
The VW brand's plans to further reduce production costs could come at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the carmaker's works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. Of which 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
The "Zukunftspakt" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be reduced at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, an employment guarantee applies until 2029.
As our newspaper learned from the work council, however, jobs in production which were not actually available were being "sneakily" eliminated by another route - i.e. bypassing the official course.
The works council has no means of forcing recruitment in these cases. Meanwhile, many jobs are lacking, the workload is increasing, and worries about a gradual decline in the number of vehicles are growing. This is also causing concern that vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW said only that "an adjustment of the employment volume is being made as agreed along the socially acceptable demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and to control new projects centrally. This will also reduce costs and speed up decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production chief Andreas Tostmann said at a manager's conference in Berlin: "Just as in uncertain times from Brexit to the threat of a trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof".
The production of the Golf 8 will be reduced by 1.1 hours, according to Tostmann, who told reporters that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter produce components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars must be built annually in order for the plant to be profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining demand for diesel and the problems in switching to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas test method.
As production manager Tostmann announced last year, a million cars are expected to be produced in Wolfsburg, which should make it possible to concentrate Golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant will give the Golf production to the location for the production of e-cars by converting it into a production site.
The Volkswagen Golf 8 is the first car to be produced in Europe, and the first to be produced in Germany, and the first to be produced in Germany.
Forced into prostitution by voodoo: Trafficking convicted
Young Nigerian women have been trafficked into the Ruhr, where they have been subjected to a number of oaths and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers are facing prison sentences.
Six Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to eight years and three months' imprisonment on Friday in Bochum for trafficking young Nigerian women into the Ruhr area and forcing them into prostitution, after they had to make voodoo priests swear an oath to compel them to obey them.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean in rubber boats with the help of Libyan smugglers. The dream of a better future was not fulfilled, however. Once in Germany, they were distributed among different brothels to work off the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25 000 euros. The wages were therefore completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - admitted in the trial that they had smuggled and distributed the young Nigerian women into brothels. "The work made it physically and mentally difficult for the women", said Judge Isabel Hoffmann when she pronounced sentence. "Some were rightly disgusted".
The convictions are for the forced entry of foreigners by trade and gangs, human trafficking, pimping and forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In a continuing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants' union Ufo has threatened strikes again.
The Commission has also taken a number of measures to ensure that the EU's air transport sector is not left to the exclusion of the airlines from the EU's competition policy, and that the EU's air transport policy is not restricted to the airlines' own air transport services.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened by a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to have it established that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is considering whether to appeal against it. "I think it is unlikely that a second court will see the matter in a completely different way", said Ufo's board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt for judicial review of Ufo's status as a trade union, arguing that the union had not appointed a representative board of directors for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
The union had been in the throes of a leadership dispute, in which numerous members of the executive and advisory board resigned, including long-time union leader Nicoley Baublies.
The EU is also working to promote the development of a common European policy on migration.
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but that is about to change as the Persian Gulf country is introducing new visa requirements.
The Saudi tourism commission said that Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists with a new visa system and to increase the number of international and domesticvisitors to 100 million per year by 2030.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country", said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has been a difficult country to access for tourists, who usually get visas for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visits with relatives in the desert state.The new rules are expected to boost the kingdom's tourism revenue.Riyad says it is aiming to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones struck two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field.As a result, the country's oil production plummeted, and oil prices skyrocketed.It is likely to take several weeks for the kingdom's oil production to return to its previous level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are getting ready for their wedding party.
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) in which she is seen in a white wedding dress. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to People Magazine.
Justin posted several colourful suits on Instagram, including one with banana printing, and asked his followers to "help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding".
The Biebers signed on to a recording contract in New York City a year ago, the biggest party ever.
In a recent interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey stated that after initial problems, the two had found a common ground: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two killed in Czech plane crash
Two people were killed in a small plane crash in western the Czech Republic, the wreckage of which was discovered in a forest area near the city of Mecin on Friday, police said.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent a distress signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also used in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of Europe's tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, exotic species, unsustainable logging and urban growth are also the causes of the threat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported in Brussels on Friday. It has examined the stock of all 454 known tree species in Europe, 265 of which are found on no other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus are on the verge of extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories, ranging from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "endangered", and "extinct in the wild" to "extinct".
The wild and feral red chestnut is threatened
"Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the conversion or weakening of their habitats".
The wild Common Chestnut is also in poor condition. It has been classified as "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan miniature moth, next to a fungus. It has spread from southeastern Europe across the entire continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. The IUCN estimates the number of wild chestnut trees (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to be less than 10,000 specimens.
The species of tree and the moose are also endangered
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrews and moose.More than a fifth of molluscs and moose and almost half of all shrews are threatened, according to the IUCN.This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change.Molluscs such as snails play a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, which form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet", said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We need to limit the impact of man on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".
34 injured in Istanbul earthquake
Turkey's vice president Fuat Oktay said Friday that 34 people were injured in the latest earthquake, but no one was killed, dozens of people had to leave their homes and 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged, and nearly 200 aftershocks have occurred since the earthquake the day before, after a 5.8 magnitude earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region outside Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
The government now wants to set up a commission to prepare the country for future earthquakes, said Oktay.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly seismically vulnerable, as a section of the North Anatolian Rift, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates, lies beneath the Sea of Marmara.
One of the worst earthquakes was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul, with an epicenter in G√∂lc√ºk, southeast of Istanbul, killing more than 17,000 people.
On Tuesday, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region around Istanbul, and authorities urged residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will host the Super Bowl halftime show, the singers announced on Twitter. "It's not getting bigger", Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez.
Jennifer Lopez stated that she has dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - when she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina". She can't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira said in a statement that she feels honored to be standing alongside another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the US and around the world. "And then on my birthday!" the main sponsor of the event tweeted that it was the first time the two "queens" were on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fighting against falling viewers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season, and the game and the halftime show are among the most-watched television broadcasts in the U.S. Even if you look at the recent drop in viewership, this February, the show attracted the fewest viewers in the U.S. in more than a decade, but still averaged nearly a hundred million people.
The halftime show of the last Super Bowl had been rife with controversy: In the dispute over the treatment of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, media reports claimed that top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 hosted the halftime show - the critics were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had kneeled during the 2016/17 season before NFL games during the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump sharply attacked the mostly African-American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been unsuccessful since March 2017 and has not played an NFL game.
Hotels get money from insurance
The failure of travel company Thomas Cook is likely to cost some banks dearly, according to a press report, and there is a risk of large write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, the Financial Times said in its Friday edition.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse could face total write-downs of up to 1.8 billion pounds (around 2 billion euros), according to the report, according to estimates by the consultancy AlixPartners.
The paper's expert said that borrowers would have to accept write-offs of between ¬£900 million and ¬£1 billion, and lenders between ¬£550 million and ¬£825 million, with the actual amounts to be written off likely to be at the upper end of the range.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should be consulted on the proposal for a directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, and on the proposal for a directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, and on the proposal for a directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information", said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, to the dpa news agency.
The European Union has also been called upon to take action to combat the spread of the disease, to help the victims of the disease and to help the victims of the disease, and to support the victims of the disease.
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants into the port of Lampedusa on June 29th, and had hit a ship of the Italian financial police.
US warns German government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting Chinese network equipment manufacturer Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great", Pai told the Handelsblatt, looking at the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
The FCC chief added that the law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to require suppliers to provide a "declaration of trustworthiness".
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of European citizens who are eligible to vote in the European Parliament.
Pai doubts that this is possible.
The software is particularly important in keeping the equipment up to date, and it consists of billions of lines of code that change over time", said Pai.
It is "very hard to imagine" that any government agency, "anywhere, would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks", the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership structure is opaque and the employee association that is supposed to own the company is not necessarily independent of the government", Pai told Handelsblatt.
The US has intelligence that indicates that government employees are stationed inside the company.
Chemical plant burns in northern France: Schools closed
A giant wall of fire lights up the sky above a chemical plant in northern France. The fire was put out after hours - but the cleanup could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and kindergartens in the region remain closed.
In 12 municipalities, the prefecture said that the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, and that the Ministry of the Interior had urged people to stay indoors as much as possible and not to expose themselves to smoke.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday night, the prefecture said, adding that the fire was still in danger of spreading after the extinguishing of the fire, according to the prefecture on Twitter.
A giant plume of black smoke had risen from the chemical plant earlier, French media reported, with huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol plant, which produces additives for oils, a production facility a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy, according to the authorities, belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-Andr√© Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that "high toxicity" had not been detected in samples initially.
The fire broke out at around 2.40am, authorities said, but the cause was not immediately clear.
French Finance Minister: 'Germany must invest now'
French Minister for the Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better", said Le Maire on Thursday evening, presenting the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone was weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to worsen before making the necessary decisions".
The Commissioner said that the EU had to take action to ensure that the EU was able to meet its commitments to the EU.
The Commissioner said that the Commission had not yet taken a decision on the application of the new rules on the application of the rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the application of the new rules on the new rules on application of the new rules on the new rules.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to increase public investment to stimulate the European economy, while German politicians have repeatedly called on France to bring its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides tax relief for households of more than nine billion euros.
The French government is reacting to the protests of the yellow vest movement, which are expected to reduce the debt to 2.2 percent, down from 3.1 percent this year.
He is still trying to trick me: Johnson dodges question on Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson is sharply critical of the "capitulation law" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician avoids this possibility when asked.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping his head down about whether he wants to implement a no-deal Brexit - despite the latest law passed by Parliament that is supposed to prevent that from happening.
The law requires the government to request a delay in the withdrawal date if no deal is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticises as a "surrender law" that would make negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday suggested that Johnson might try to use "political bullying" to circumvent the law, and that the prime minister could use a procedural trick to delay the law's entry into force until after Brexit.
Mr Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, said he saw the Brexit political debate as a 'walk in the park' and was confident that the EU exit was still possible: 'We enjoy it, we will win, we will exit, don't worry' Cummings told the Telegraph newspaper at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the "Vote Leave" Brexit campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now the chief strategist at Downing Street, the headquarters of the British government, and is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has put the prime minister in an almost impossible situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers, but it doesn't always have to be the big glamour.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until her death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the pre-Instagram era, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film".
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, always had her camera with her, and she has taken thousands of Polaroids, several hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
"She wanted real moments", writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his introduction, "and of course, there is always one in the spotlight: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in a bathrobe with a bag over his head, or wears shabby moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in the south of England or in Scotland. So, according to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that as a baby she slept in a bed her father had made out of old potato boxes. And the McCartneys didn't always have it tidy, either.
Like few other media, the Polaroid camera captures the immediate moment, and the footage of Linda McCartney is certainly a kind of family diary, but it's much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to know when a great photo is in front of you, and then you have to snap it at the exact right moment", Paul McCartney said. "If you snap it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo". And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing the exact right moment. "She just knew she had it", Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The lighting, the composition, the cutting and the colours are just right, which makes The Polaroid Diaries not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes can sometimes look like abstract paintings, the perfect complement to the newly released Beatles album Abbey Road, which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighbor despite US sanctions on Iran, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there", Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey has problems importing Iranian oil because some companies "have backed off because of the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and many other issues", said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since it withdrew from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, claiming that Iran is pursuing a secret nuclear program and is not abiding by the agreement.
The sanctions have led to a collapse in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
US government wants to restrict refugee admissions
The U.S. government is seeking to drastically reduce the number of refugees it accepts, with the State Department saying Thursday that the annual cap on resettlement programs will be cut from the current 30,000 to 18,000, a 40 percent cut.
The State Department said that while the United States remained committed to supporting refugees, its most important mission was to protect and serve U.S. citizens, and that the U.S. immigration system was currently overwhelmed.
The US government intends to focus on two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith, and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger, according to the State Department statement.
The program, which was established in 1980, will select refugees from UN camps around the world and resettle them in the U.S. The cap of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 fiscal year would be the lowest in the program's history, while the current cap of 30,000 is already a low, and when President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
Aid agencies were appalled by the announcement of the lowering of the cap. "This is a very sad day for America", said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, adding that the US would further damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States, both legal and illegal.The US government has said it expects 350,000 asylum applications for the next fiscal year.These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Get close to an informer"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of spying. "Anyone who leaked information to an informant who accused him of abusing his power is a close second to a snitch", Trump said in a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday, according to multiple US media reports.
Trump then spoke to the staff of the U.S. mission to the United Nations. When asked who had tipped off the whistleblower about controversial White House activities, he said, "That's close to a leak". Trump then added, "You know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and the treason, we used to do it a little differently than we do now".
Observers assessed the latter remark as a possible reference to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticized Trump's remarks, accusing him of intimidating witnesses, and of trying to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment case against him, the chairs of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees wrote.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now-published complaint of abusing his office to request interference by another country in the 2020 US election, specifically his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested to him that he launch an investigation against his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is not yet clear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are, but according to the New York Times, the whistleblower is believed to be an analyst for the CIA's foreign intelligence agency.
Baby and toddler drown in Aegean Sea
The European Union is also working on a new programme for the protection of the environment, which will be implemented by the European Commission in the next few years.
The Greek coast guard has reported that seven migrants were killed when a rubber boat sank off the Greek island of Chios, including a baby and four other children, but that four children, three women and five men were rescued by the crew of a passing ferry.
The victims included a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning, trying to reach the small island group of Inousses in the north-east of the island of Chios, which lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The countries of origin of the migrants are not yet known, but hundreds of migrants are currently travelling from Turkey to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean, mostly in far too small boats, and last year 174 people died on this route, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The Who are breaking up the show
A concert by the American rock band The Who ended abruptly due to an illness of lead singer Roger Daltrey.
Lead guitarist Pete Townshend apologized and said that Daltrey was "really not able to speak right now". Townsend promised the audience that he would pay for a makeover concert, but a date has not yet been set.
The Who's scheduled shows in Dallas on Friday and Denver on Sunday have been cancelled, and will be rescheduled for a later date.
WeWork is shaking the real estate market
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork has risen from a small startup to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis, with landlords fearful of losing billions in revenue.
The crisis of office tenant WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world's largest real estate market. The company recently fired founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed its planned IPO, and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet to executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork rents large office space long term and rents it short term in some small units to members. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company posted a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs have increased by an estimated 2.5 billion dollars due to the rental of new large areas. To limit the loss, the new company management has now pulled the emergency brakes and stopped renting new areas with Wirkung sofor.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases with a term of up to 15 years, which result in liabilities of more than $40 billion, and these huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork leased nearly 300,000 square feet of office space in Manhattan, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, in the past 24 months. WeWork's new leases alone have seen the demand for office space in New York exceed the amount of new space that has come on the market in that time. Without WeWork's expansion, office vacancies in the US metropolis would have risen during that time, Alpert wrote in Business Insider.
The balance of the property market in the British capital could also be seriously upset if the aggressive startup does not expand further. e prime tenant is WeWork, in an office building in the centre of the financial metropolis bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost ‚Ç¨100 million.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet WeWork's requirements with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would have to write off some of the billions in revenue they had hoped for. They do not have access to WeWork's already scarce reserves despite the long-term lease agreements. Because the rental of WeWork's individual sites is usually done by subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company has only limited liability.
Russia arrested many North Korean fishermen again
The Russian coast guard has taken action against North Korean fishermen again, arresting 262 other poachers who illegally fished in the waters in recent days, the Russian FSB said on Friday, according to Interfax.
The North Korean government has said that it has arrested 161 fishermen in the past 10 days, and that three of them were injured in the previous shooting of border guards, but that no one was hurt this time.
The North Korean fishermen were reportedly in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian coast guard patrolled to protect their marine biological resources, according to the agency's own data. The new inspections revealed 30,000 squid, three fishing boats and two motorboats were seized and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok, according to the agency Ria Novosti, in 2018 the coast guard detected more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian fisheries authority had also failed to issue fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, following complaints from local entrepreneurs.
Georgi Martynow, head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Primorye region, recently complained about the environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen who use narrow mesh synthetic nets, which are banned in Russia, to catch small creatures in the sea, and then simply dump the nets in the sea, where they take 200 years to decompose.
On September 17, Russian border guards first detained a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire. The incident occurred on September 17, when a Russian vessel was attacked by a North Korean vessel and the Russian vessel opened fire.
US imposes travel ban on former president Castro
The United States has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro and his children, citing Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations" as the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean nation, which has thousands of Cubans arbitrarily detained and more than 100 political prisoners.
"The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and use of force to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela", tweeted US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced travel bans, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and military. Venezuela has been in a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition for months. The US has imposed a series of sanctions on the Maduro government to bring it to its knees and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaid√≥ to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies, receiving oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of doctors sent there, and according to the US and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress dissenters.
New climate tests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests ever, thousands of people are taking to the streets today to demand more action on climate change.
The movement Fridays for Future plans to hold new actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world to end an international climate strike week. Due to the time change, the protests are likely to start in New Zealand and Australia, before spreading to Europe and North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
"Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. Let's do it again this Friday!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
In Germany, the turnout was particularly high last Friday, with a good third of all global protesters - around 1.4 million - taking part in protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time around, according to a list of the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as J√ºchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thunberg took to the Swedish Parliament to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection.
The European Parliament has called for a new approach to the EU's energy policy, which is based on the principle of 'a single market', and has called for the Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's energy policy is not undermined by the current crisis.
Thunberg arrived in New York City on a yacht less than a month after a two-week transatlantic cruise on a high-sea racing yacht, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits at the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke forcefully to the conscience of the world's heads of state and government. In her home city of Stockholm, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Foundation's Alternative Nobel Prize on Wednesday for her efforts to protect the climate.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
"This also applies to smoking", a spokesman for the Emergency Ministry told Tass news agency in Moscow on Thursday.
The Ministry of Health has also announced that smoking cigarettes is prohibited in the country, but that those who do smoke will be fined 3,000 rubles (¬£42.46).
The attack against cybercriminals - investigators lift servers
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators have for the first time identified a major server provider for illegal transactions on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites, through which international criminals operated their machinations, as the operator of a computer centre in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel.
The prosecutor general's office in Koblenz has announced the arrest of seven suspects in a major operation on Thursday night.
The suspects' clients were the operators of the world's second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, Wall Street Market, which investigators had smashed in the spring.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to provide the Member States with a copy of the information contained in the register of the host country.
The raid, which was carried out by special forces such as the GSG9, was the result of almost five years of investigation and will be followed by further details at noon.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests ever, thousands of people are taking to the streets again today to demand more climate protection.
To conclude an international week of climate strikes, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as J√ºchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on the island of Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests  Who are Thunberg's backers, really?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. It is all the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl of the time is the one who holds the power man of the time in contempt. But what is behind this? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is moving the masses and getting young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically speaking, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a group of children and young people for himself. Already in the year 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt himself out of place to fight for a fairer world. At that time, he also managed to win a crowd of young people for himself and persuade them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently made the trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side to this? Why does a campaign called "We don't have time" need to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold widely, thanks to her daughter in the spotlight. Even long-time followers of Greta Thunberg were a little outraged by the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too thick for some followers. This is not unfounded, because the campaign was very well received in the media worldwide and a lot of money was lost thanks to the impressive campaign.
Here the minds are divided: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially while saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work with stockbrokers during the world saving action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it may make sense to critically question even seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: interstellar guest crossing through our solar system
A strange comet is passing through our solar system at this moment.
Astronomers' predictions have been confirmed: An alien comet is passing through our solar system right now - only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, scientists only suspected, but now they know for sure: a comet from another star is passing through our solar system right now, named after its discoverer, 2I/Borisov, and currently engaging astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in the Crimea
The object was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in the Crimea, who looked at the sky with a homemade telescope, and further observations confirmed his initial suspicion that it was indeed an unknown comet not from our solar system, and only the second of its kind to be seen in transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers to get up close to an alien solar system is now open. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), and is currently moving in a so-called hypervelocity orbit that is leading it out of our system.
Comet was spotted before it arrived - and can be observed for several months
Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been observed in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach its maximum brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency NASA. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".

Early findings about Comet 2I/Borisov give hope to science
The first observations suggest that the comet is between 2 and 16 kilometres in diameter, and that the object is similar to our comet - as IAC researcher Julia de Le√≥n put it, the spectrum of the comet is similar to ours.
The fact that two such objects have been discovered in just two years may open a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are a constant concern for scientists, and recently a giant asteroid came dangerously close to the earth.
'Absolutely reprehensible': Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Boris Johnson is getting lonely. First his younger brother leaves the Cabinet, now his sister is whipping the Prime Minister's belligerent language as "tasteless" in clear words. It's not the brother she knows.
The European Parliament has voted in favour of the Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the directive to include the following areas: the protection of the environment, the environment, the protection of the consumer, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment against the risks of pollution, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of human rights, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the protection of the environment, the prevention of crime, the fight against crime, the fight against terrorism, the fight against crime, the fight against crime, the fight against crime, the fight against corruption, the fight against corruption, the fight against crime, the fight against crime, the fight against crime, the fight against crime, the fight against poverty, the fight against hunger, the fight against hunger, the fight against hunger, the fight against hunger, the fight against hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, the hunger, hunger, hunger, hunger, hunger, hunger, hunger, hung hung hunger, hunger, hunger, hung hunger, hunger, hunger, hung hunger, hung hung hunger, hunger, hunger, hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung and hung hung hunger, hung hunger, hunger, hunger, hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung, hung hunger, hung hung hung hung hung hung hung, hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung hung, hung hung hung, hung hung hung, hung hung hung, hung, hung hung hung hung, hung hung, hung hung hung hung hung hung, hung, hung, hung hung hung hung hung hung, hung hung hung hung, hung hung hung
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as surrender as if those opposed to leaving the EU should be "hung, drawn, quartered, beaten and feathered". She considered this to be extremely reprehensible.
In particular, she was struck by her brother's mention of Jo Cox, a pro-EU MP who was murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 Brexit referendum, whose memory could best be honoured by getting Brexit through, Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons. "It is very distasteful to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'", Johnson's sister said.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like that", he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to be passionate and determined for what you believe in - no matter what your views are. But never "demonize the other side". He also lamented that an atmosphere had been created in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and Tory MP. "I have been torn in recent months between loyalty to family and the national interest - it's an unresolvable tension", said Jo Johnson, explaining the move.
The Times reports that all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England have criticized the language as "unworthy of this country". In a joint statement, they said: "In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside of Parliament.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is making a strong statement in its 100th year, as two women with Latino roots perform at the Super Bowl halftime show, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Super Bowl powerhouse Latina Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will host the halftime show at the upcoming NFL season finale, organizers announced Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to be representing the Latino community alongside JLo, because they have incredible strength in the U.S"., Shakira said in a video.
The American Football League's 100th anniversary finals will be held in Miami on February 2nd. The city on the southern tip of Florida is home to many people with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") is from Colombia, and Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican descent.
"I love that the Super Bowl is putting two women on the stage this time - and two Latinas", Lopez said, sending an important message to all Americans and the world, promising "an explosion of fun and energy" for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the United States every year. This year, many also see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event in the United States and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyonc√©, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL final, it is also extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversy erupted in the run-up to the Super Bowl, with the controversy over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand during the playing of the national anthem in protest against police brutality against black people, and was harshly criticized by US President Donald Trump, among others.
An actor and Youtuber is joining Egypt's ruler: For now, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have the power to determine whether blood will flow again on Egyptian streets spent the past week abroad. One of them floated back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former general, who in 2013 deposed the country's first freely elected head of state, Muslim Brother Mohammed Morsi, had a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump praised Sisi's care for political Islam and lost no silver lining over human rights abuses on the Nile - in a week when Egyptian security forces arrested dogs for people who had dared to protest against the president. "There are no concerns", Sisi said on the plane, "the Egyptian government has not let the Iranian leader in".
The other man, according to the president, who is currently in charge of the streets, is trying to mislead. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he escaped the reach of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old actor was known only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the voice of the political discourse in the country's cafes, living rooms and tea rooms: Ali is calling on his fellow countrymen to rise up against him with his YouTube channel "Mohammed Secrets".
He addresses the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president revels in luxury and builds magnificent new palaces, it is said. The military command on which Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with these very gentlemen for 15 years in his second career as a contractor, he seems to know quite well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the clicks that are about to explode show.
Last week, after thousands of people demonstrated against his rule for the first time since Sisi took power, and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "March of Millions" on Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would actually venture out onto the streets, but there were occasional smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, whose participants warned Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. During these protests, the police also used gas and a truncheon. These videos did not initially leave unchecked.
In the Nile Delta city of Mansura, where protesters tore apart banners bearing the president's portrait last week, a massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the byways. In Cairo, several metro stations were closed downtown for "maintenance", and most of the roads around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where in 2013 supporters of the overthrown Muslim Brotherhood gathered until the army opened fire on them and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent unrest from gathering: Ziguis party wanted to hold a large rally for the president here.
Mohamed Ali was prompted by these precautions to change his tactics: "Our target doesn't have to be Tahrir Square", Ali told his camera in Barcelona. "Let's not bump into police officers".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are several ways of checking.
The Internet contract does not require you to rely blindly on the speed data provided by the provider, but rather to check for yourself how much is actually achieved.
The Commission has therefore decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the application of the principle of proportionality.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are several ways of checking this: the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
'The tests of the providers are however carried out according to the specifications of the providers and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated,' the consumer centre Bavaria points out.
If the connection is much slower than advertised, customers can give the provider a reasonable period of time, usually 14 days, to deliver the promised service.
If this does not work after repeated requests, customers can terminate and possibly also claim damages.
First ranking Republican to be investigated
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it goes from here will be determined by the facts that are established", Phil Scott said at a news conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before any action is taken - an impeachment process can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden's interventions in Ukraine, as Trump has been watching Biden "for seven years".
Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly spoken out against Trump's policies, including the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration laws.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland should continue.
Spider-Man: Homecoming is the third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the first film to be released in the United States since Spider-Man: Far From Home in July 2021.
Screenrant quotes Marvel boss Kevin Feige as saying, "I'm glad that Spidey's path is being continued in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are thrilled that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on its Spidey version. You never know what the future will bring".
The news is that Sony has reportedly made an offer to Marvel, and according to industry magazines, Disney, which Marvel is part of, would get a 30% share of the revenue from the upcoming Spider-Man films.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry look in the Suits finale.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale. In the last episode there were many happy endings and as many cameos. And the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked for many years in the series, were also charmingly paid tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
By the way, Duchess Meghan did not return for a final goodbye to Rachel Zane in the finale, at least not for new scenes, but instead, some flashbacks showed the most memorable scenes with the current Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful marriage with Mike or how she welcomes him back after his prison sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking down the aisle to marry his fianc√©e Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a revealing remark about his attire. Whether he has actually worn a gown, Harvey wants to know from the bewildered groom, only to then bluntly remark: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boating accident
A baby and four other children drowned when a migrant boat capsized in the Aegean Sea. Seven people died in total, the Greek coast guard said Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland, and four children, three women and five men were rescued.
The European Union is also working to ensure that the EU's citizens are able to access the EU's external borders and to ensure that the EU's external borders are not crossed by the EU's external borders.
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East, calling on the EU to take action to help the victims of the conflict in the region and urging the EU to take action to help the victims of the conflict in the region.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed on Friday that Seehofer was planning to travel with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Greece continues to receive an unusually high number of migrants from Turkey, with 654 people crossing to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increase in numbers has recently raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey deal, which allows the EU to return all refugees and migrants illegally entering the Greek islands via Turkey, in exchange for one Syrian refugee from Turkey for every one deported.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the implementation of the new law on asylum, which is to be adopted by the Council in June, and on the application of the new law to the Member States.
The number of refugees in Turkey is the highest since the EU-Turkey refugee pact came into force in March 2016, the state broadcaster Staatsrundfunk reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
The German Society for Cardiology president Andreas Zeiher said that climate change is "quite certainly" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years. High temperatures and large temperature changes in a short time period are causing the cardiovascular system in particular and are leading to an increase in heart attacks. People with cardiovascular diseases, the elderly and diabetics are especially affected.
Green politician to be held accountable for embarrassing photo op
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Party leader was pictured holding a reusable cup in her hand, but now it was revealed that the cup had been tampered with.
Ottawa/Canada - It went unnoticed for a long time - and finally caught on. The reusable coffee cup with a metal straw never came into the hands of Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website, she was seen in a photo with this cup, talking to citizens. However, the photo had been published before and also circulated to the media - and then the cup was still a schneider (Papp) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green leader must answer for photo-op failure
The National Post accused May of manipulating the party and producing fake news to make it look more credible on the environment, amid a House of Commons election campaign that is also plaguing Trudeau over a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media, fuelling discussion about fake news, with one user sharing a juxtaposition of the photos and writing, "The Greens are manipulating a photo of their chairmen to hide their one-time cup".
May expressed shock and claimed on her blog that she had not heard of this action. To underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in hand. The one, however, she correctly stated, was made of bamboo. She always has it. A spokeswoman for the party said that it was only to accommodate the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something.
May writes that she feels sorry for the co-worker who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide", she tells the Guardian, while also asking about her over-worked team: "If they want to edit a picture again, can't they do something with my face to make me look younger?"
The German Greens have also been in shitstorms because of their use of single-use plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: lifetime ban from Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was allegedly promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific in an email, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was denied boarding - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
To get a spontaneous upgrade to business class, which is the dream of many passengers, sometimes they get lucky and the staff at check-in offers a free transfer from economy class.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: A self-proclaimed influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng has more than 65,000 followers. On May 30, she flew from Taiwan to New York and on June 7, she flew back.
On the flight there, the staff refused Jaqueline an upgrade, although she had shown an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered her an upgrade. The letter claims that the influencer received from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, however, accuses Jaqueline of having forged the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman reportedly showed the same email, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they checked with the head office. In fact, the employee from whom the email allegedly originated denied email contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifetime ban on Cathay Pacific, forcing her to buy a new ticket to Taiwan for $1,400 (about $1,200).
The influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a consumer advocacy firm, because Cathay had reimbursed her for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline doesn't submit the email metadata, the case is clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains suspended from future flights, and the airline's terms of service also state that she doesn't have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline doesn't want to settle for that - and is now bringing in a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after report of ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest amount of time on Friday at noon, with a barrel of North Sea Brent oil (159 litres) selling for $61.83 - about 1.4 percent lower than the previous day.
The move was prompted by a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia reportedly agreed to in four areas.
A drone attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in mid-September had brought down five percent of global oil production. Iran-allied Houthi rebels in the civil war-torn country of Yemen had claimed the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If a deal does come through, growth and demand concerns can be focused on, said Ole Hansen, head of Saxo Bank's commodity strategy department.
The price of oil is thus continuing its downward movement in recent days, with WTI oil costing almost 59 dollars a barrel a week ago and Brent oil costing almost 65 dollars.
Bloomberg recently reported that, citing insiders, repairs to oil facilities in Saudi Arabia following the September attack were progressing faster than expected, with production levels reaching 8 million barrels per day and moving back toward the original levels.
Recently, there have been several press reports citing insiders reporting rapid progress in repairs by state oil company Saudi Aramco, but commodity experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there has been a certain easing of tensions between Iran and the West: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leave the port, more than two months after being detained by Iran and the recent release.
However, the US has announced that it will deploy missiles and troops to Saudi Arabia, Iran's arch-enemy, as fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the UK have driven up oil prices in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, accusations of collusion against the White House have been made. Several senior government officials have made intensive efforts to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a contentious phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. The speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "concealment". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea says third Trump-Kim summit is questionable
North Korea has cast doubt on the prospect of a third summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute, citing the lack of progress in implementing the agreements reached at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to KCNA.
The US has so far failed to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the North Korean foreign ministry adviser, who also criticised the tightening of US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers between the US and South Korea, but said he hoped Trump would make a "wise" and "courageous" decision to bring the two countries closer again.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he prepared to do so. Negotiations on disarming North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, the two met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to resume the talks, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers to help clear mines
In a blue splinter vest, the British Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he set the firing circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. With the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later called on TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who did not help to clear the way, to commit to help".
Pound under pressure - Interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
The pound is losing value against the euro in the face of a forthcoming rate cut.
Speculation about a forthcoming rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is adding to the pound sterling's value, which fell by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sale was triggered by comments from central bank chief Michael Saunders, who suggested that a rate cut could be avoided even if a chaotic Brexit were to occur, as the uncertainty would affect the UK economy for the foreseeable future.
The Bank of England had already warned last week of the economic impact of the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on October 31st, even without a divorce agreement.
More: The British Prime Minister has taken a big risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Further Russian manipulation proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and now head of integrity for the World Athletics Association.
As the World Athletics Championships kick off, new details are emerging about the doping scandal in Russia - and they are destroying the little credibility that Russian sports had regained at the beginning of the year, and only partially. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the samples requested from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
In December 2014, systematic cheating in Russian sport was revealed, and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) was banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for three years. During this period, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage.
No positive results were found
In the following September, the WADA lifted the Rusada ban, but requested access to the lab and said samples, which were supposed to reveal the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping, to help punish athletes afterwards.
The chairman of the IAAF's Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes, we received the data nine months ago. We should have checked whether the task force had received the correct data", said David Howman in the interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Friday. "We found numerous discrepancies between the data received from a whistleblower and the data received from the Russians in January". Many positive findings mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: the Athletics Federation is the only organization that maintains the ban on Russia. 30 Russian athletes will participate in the World Championships in Doha under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
Earlier this week, Wada exposed the manipulation and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks, and now Russia is threatening to ban Rusada again, and in the worst case, to exclude it from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
