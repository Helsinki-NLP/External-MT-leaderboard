Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had modern flush toilets with sewerage systems in almost every home.
The remains of a sewage system have been found in homes in the towns of Minowan, Crete and in the Santorini region of Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, toilets were also present. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths, where men and women performed daily rituals together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The call is sent to the satellite in space and the return is reflected at the same speed.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view.
To put a satellite or telescope in space, you need a giant rocket 100 feet high.
THE BIRDS have changed the world in an incredible way.The biggest benefit they've given us is that we have easier and faster transportation.
It has given us trains, cars and many other means of transport.
Among them, the majority are medium-sized cats, which hunt and eat normal-sized rabbits, grass and deer.
Finally, there are small cats (including domestic cats) that prey on a number of small worms such as insects, rodents, wasps, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the nest, a special task that each cat has, which prevents them from competing with others.
The lion is a cat species that likes to socialize and lives in large groups called pride.
Prides, consisting of 1 to 3 related adult males, plus thirty females and cubs.

Lion females behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are very lethal to their prey.
The tiger can climb (though not quite so well), swim, glide for long distances, and pull with the five forces of a strong man.
The tiger is in the group of lions, leopards and jaguars (genus Panthera). Only these four cats can roar.

Osillates prefer to eat smaller animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can.
The scientists thought that from the smell of the ground, the leopard would follow and find the animal (the victim) to eat.
They have eyes that can see clearly in the dark, and they can move around undetected. Oscillators are so blended with their surroundings that they can't be seen, and then they jump on their prey.
When small groups of organisms (small populations) are separated from their main group (forward across a mountain range, or across a river, or once on a new island) they find that the climate is different from what they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, and thus different features or adaptations are needed for the new population to be a sustainable competitor than was previously required.
The basic population has not changed, they still need transformations as before.
Over time, as the new generation begins to adapt to their new environment, they are less likely to look with confidence towards other communities.
After thousands or millions of years, the two communities will look different, and thus they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "specificity", which means the creation of new varieties. Specificity is an inevitable process and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e. inhalation and exhalation).

We make our houses out of wood and our clothes out of wood. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the most predatory animal of its time, and thus it was not afraid of anything other than other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are composed of more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and it also has extra teeth in the upper parts of its mouth, meaning that it is impossible to escape objects caught in its jaw.
Although we cannot be sure, it may have had a cleft tongue. It may have fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a native predator.
It attacked any animal that landed in the water, even the most monstrous T. rex.
Though we are familiar with most of the foods of the Romans, they ate strange or unusual meat dishes during their festivals, including wild boar, hawk, deer worm, and a type of rodent known as the darmouse.
Another difference was that poor men and women ate in chairs, whereas rich men were more likely to spend time in banquets.
The ancient Roman diet did not include foods that were introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted the taste of turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the gods.
The people were offering sacrifices to God, and the priests and priests were trying to satisfy God's requirements through festivals and ceremonies.

If you watch the National Treasure movie, you might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
"I'm sorry", she said, "but I'm not sure what I'm doing".
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" were written on the back of each copy of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is unknown who wrote it, in the days when it was made as we know it, this large piece of parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches X 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped in a roll.

The D-Day Landings and subsequent wars were open to the north of France, but the south was not yet independent.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had dealt with the invaders rather than fight them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what became known as "Operation Dragon".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French regiments had liberated southern France and were marching towards Germany.






It also had no power to override tax laws and duties between States.
The articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were usually absent from the meeting.

Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when sailors sailing near the island named it Ilha Fermossa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a transformation of Aboriginal grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) military forces seized control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared the Taiwan territory a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which Japan was granted a monopoly of Taiwan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main figures, namely, the Intuitana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what the complexes originally looked like.

For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the size of a movie screen at the end of the analog film era.

35mm format is actually, a bit confusing, 36mm wide is 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS series formats) are equivalent to or approximate to this aspect ratio.
The most abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple rule of thumb for maintaining the measure of a picture's order.

The Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful at this time in European history, was investigated.
For nearly a thousand years, Christianity held sway over the kingdoms of Europe, despite their diversity of language and traditions.
The power of the empire was spread from the king to the common people.

The central authority of the Church has been based in Rome for millennia, and this centralization of power and money raises many questions as to whether this doctrine is maintained.

This strategy of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies proved effective, but the blockade violated the universally agreed upon international law, consolidated by numerous international treaties of the past two centuries.
UK mining in international waters, so that no ships could penetrate the entire sea, also posed a risk to neutral ships.

In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to join the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived at US, he had only 4 cents in cash, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachler (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The most well-known is the instability between the three provinces for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.

The Three Kingdoms was the most brutal era in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the top post in the magnificent palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences here such as the use of the metric system, the shift from realism to republicanism, nationalism and the feeling that the country belongs to the people and not to a king.
After the revolution, jobs were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful men to achieve success.
This applies to the military, as now the rank of an army is not determined by rank, but by saber.
The French Revolution, for example, prompted the exploited working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He would often observe a cave on the mountain "Nur" (light) as a "hira".

The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza", at the edge of Egypt's valley, features numerous pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), small tombs, temples, and large statues.
The great pyramid was built in honour of the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour the wives and family members of Khufu.
"Arrow up" looks like a V and "Arrow down" looks like a square with a major or a minor missing.
Up means you start at the end and push the bow, and down means you start at the bottom (i.e. where your hand is holding) and pull the bow.
Up-blow makes a soft sound, but down-blow makes a loud sound and is more precise.

The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette's two young children (11 year old Marie Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth were forced to be sent back to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
He returned to Paris in a carriage amidst a surrounding mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd urged the king and queen to open the windows of their chariot even wider.
At one point, a man in the crowd threw the head of the Royal Guard, who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified Queen.
The Filipino people paid for the costs of the imperial American war to besiege the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial administration to cover the bulk of the cost and were charged interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.

The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Medieval Period was the transition from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technology-push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is written by the underlying logic and their expression in technology related to scientific laws.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two common ideas, namely: that technological development often follows a path that transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially normative.
For example, one might say that motor cars are the root cause of road development.
However, nationwide road connectivity is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods have been developed in order to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The increased number of car owners led to more road accidents, which led to the invention of new healthcare technologies to repair damaged bodies.
Romantism had a large element of cultural controlism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fisch and Schlegel.

The city was known as the center of luxury, which began around 400 BC and lasted until 1100 BC.


Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.

However, due to the slow modes of communication, the lifestyle of the Western Province may be 25 to 30 years behind.

Lifestyle farming is carried out to produce food that meets the needs of the farmer and his family.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Historically, many farmers have adopted subsistence agriculture and it is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures feel like like-minded individuals are ignored by social norms and allow for the development of a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender information of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be language, aesthetics, religiosity, politics, sexuality, geographical area, or a combination of elements.
Members of a subculture often symbolize their membership through distinctive and symbolic styles, including charms, manners, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to explain the importance of socialization is to portray some uncertain instances of children growing up, not being introduced to social life, being forcibly exploited, suffering from neglect or misfortune.
Some bullying children are shunned by the public (usually their parents); in some cases the child continues to grow up because the parent rejects the child's severe intellectual or physical weakness.
Ferrall children may have experienced severe abuse or physical injury prior to being orphaned or running away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the forest themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the animal pup will exhibit as many of the traits of that particular animal as possible (within its physical limits), meaning that humans will have traits that are feared or indifferent.
Plan-based learning simplifies learning and makes it more interesting and scaffolding.
Siddhanta Handra (Scaffolding) is not just a learning method, it is a collaboration for individuals who are getting a new learning experience, such as starting a new project or using a computer program.
The theory of scaffolding can be either real or fictional, i.e. a teacher can also be a kind of scaffolding, as well as the small paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
The software has built-in virtual scaffolding which is used to question, stimulate and explain a working method that students cannot understand themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons including neglect, abuse and robbery.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without nurturing, caring and educational environment, but they will.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our orphanage care system was about providing safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
He was in foster care for all the needs that were lacking in the house he had taken earlier.
Internet brings together the elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.

For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as the major motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Igme and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" as new motivators when investigating audience responses to web sites.
Video recording has helped to capture the analysis of subtle emotions and facial movements that last only a few moments.
In particular, it has been suggested that by correctly interpreting subtle expressions, one can find out whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his report The President's Speech, explains how people who have brain damage and cannot understand speech accurately measure honesty.
He suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior is also found in animals such as pets.
20th century research has shown that there are two types of genetic change: they are explicit and they are implicit.
The mutation is a precursor to new genetic variation and is triggered by the source of the mutations.
The differentiation and re-composition shuffle between the two groups in each generation.
On the savanna, meeting amino-acid requirements from available plant resources is a very difficult task for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans.
Furthermore, failure to do so can lead to serious consequences, namely: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
Plant-derived protein is readily available from legumes and cereals, but it is difficult for mammals like us to digest them unless we cook them.
In contrast, animal foods (crustaceans, eggs, eggs) are not easily digested, but they provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that chimpanzees do in the savannah.
Sleep disturbance is the phenomenon of waking up consciously during normal sleep and falling asleep for a short period of time (10-60 minutes).

The first domesticated goats are believed to have been domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran, about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began collecting them to preserve milk, hair, meat and skin.
The herding goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other fertile areas. Sometimes the herding was done by children or teenagers, who were herdsmen.

Although the wagons had only parallel wooden planks, horse-drawn carriages were also allowed to move, as they could travel at high speeds and carry heavy loads on steep roads.
The crusts were introduced long before the tracks were in normal condition. However, it was realised that the tracks were more efficient with an iron stitch on top.
This became a common practice, but it was detrimental to the iron, wooden wheels.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron-rails were introduced.
The first transport was walking, with Homo erectus (who means standing man) having begun walking straight two million years ago.
His predecessor, Australopithecus, was not usually upright.
The ability to walk on two legs was first found in the fossils of Astralopithecus 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.

Environmentalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.

As Greek knowledge faded, the West isolated itself from Greek science and philosophy.
As many have noted, there are some rhythms in physiology and behavior, particularly the presence of endogenous cycles and their production depends on biological clocks.
For most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, cyclical rhythms are not only recorded in response to external cyclical cues, but also in the form of a periodic pattern of vibrations.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator. Even without any external prompt, the biological clock continues for the duration of the free-running cycle.

This massive carbon economy has shaken the biosphere from its stable position, which has been underpinning human evolution for two million years.

In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they always fail? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or are more fundamental things happening?
Vehicle flow is the study of the flow between two points of an individual vehicle and driver and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study vehicle flow because one cannot predict one's driver's behavior one hundred percent.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably fixed range; therefore, traffic streams can also be represented consistently and mathematically in a gross way.
To best represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These links will help in the planning, design and operations of roadways facilities.
Insects were the first organisms to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of folding their wings around their body.
This provides a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.

In general, two behaviors can evolve into managers and lead their ex-partners. One end of the spectrum is being "like all the boys and girls".
It is very difficult for managers of this type to make unpopular decisions, to discipline, to evaluate performance, to assign responsibility and to hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, it's a complete stranger who thinks he can change what the team is doing, and do everything himself.

This quality often leads to a rift between the team and its leader.
Virtual teams are just as superior as traditional teams, with slight differences.
Virtual Team Members act as the contact person for their immediate physical group.
They generally have greater autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not make sense to local management.

"Invisible Team" is a management team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
