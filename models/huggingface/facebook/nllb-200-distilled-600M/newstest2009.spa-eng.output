The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the morning's rapid fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions in ČEZ shares reached about half their value on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of the trading Tuesday, immediately reacted to the fall on Monday when it fell to about 6%.
The drop this time is due to the fall in Wall Street stock.
The market reaction to the result of the vote by the American House of Representatives refusing to support the financial sector stabilization plan is also expressed here.
The fall in stocks in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges fell dramatically on Tuesday, although the index eventually eased some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange's index during its financial day was almost four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by virtually 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movements of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, while in Shanghai markets were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions planned in the US are uncertain and this influences the financial market around the world", said Hong Kong's Chief Currency Officer Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
US lawmakers should get back together as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
The bloody bath of American stock
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan, which should have spent $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
Lawmakers, in this way, ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to nearly seven percent, with a similar volume drop last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal was not coming forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: US government can inject $700 billion into banking
The top representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a broad-based financial aid pact to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
American lawmakers caused a gap in the talks over the rescue plan's approval in its form of assistance to the US financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it's not won yet.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the bill and get it voted on.
The financial system aid plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services and Banking Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the rescue plan ratification should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
The Commission will therefore be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the market is not affected by the current situation.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We resolve our conflicting views regarding the way the package of measures for market stabilization should be", said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislatures met Sunday night with finance minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are close to the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
The sanitation plan still needs to be continued, but I think we are already in it", said Paulson.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has a direct impact on the rapidly declining stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to finally pass a deal this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' business in the Asian financial market, as they are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, for now, nothing is certain about when the two houses of the US Congress will vote and, even, whether they will not stagnate at the last minute with some problem.
The legislators believe it will be passed in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can override its veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to raise financial resources to buy back bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives would have to be ready to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and that he appreciated "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of program money for protecting taxpayers' taxes on their losses, a relief closure of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armoured contracts for directors of the participating companies in the programme, and create a committee to have control of the Fund.
This one should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great strides toward a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also helps homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to new payments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly payments burden on debtors and allow them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, a good idea that will be implemented but rather difficult.
"And that is why it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government", Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"Much more importantly, this week, congressmen agree to support it and give it their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is, at this moment, the most important", Marek insisted.
Armed struggle: MP3 player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile device plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it's best to buy only the phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the reproducer.
The choice depends on the way it is used and the demands of the future owner.
It's probably going to be hard for me to get the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, such music products as LP discs are no longer available, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If you're cramming vinyl records with art rock, jazz, or blues music on your shelves, you're probably dreaming, at least, of this kind of record.
This is the same with the music that's on the way, that is, the compressed, simplified music -- the music in MP3.
And here are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, just as it is for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly taste the 20-crown market helmets.
Two ends, between which there's enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the battery life
Some of the best players do much more than just play music and even do what most phones don't.
No current device is as universal as the telephone.
Faced with the most basic functions like calling, texting, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and even navigate.
And when we consider the smartphone and the PDAs, they're going to have a small computer in their pocket too.
This is a little miracle since no refrigerator can make a grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the faster the screen indicator lights up asking to be recharged.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy swallows.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, much less so.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have a higher performance.
So keep in mind that cheap phones won't play for more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, they are constantly called still, for more safety, a work charger - this is also true for the more expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem won't happen, because even the worst ones can last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem happens when you record music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unrestricted readers can the small memory cards used on mobile phones be connected.
In the case of players, with some exceptions (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library based on the performer's name, album title, genre or also based on user rating.
Some devices only display a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Search and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
The choice of equipment is based on the battery's strength, memory capacity, sound quality and output type and, of course, the ease of handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you're going to listen to it every day just for a while, like on the tram, then just use any mobile phone that plays.
Which is pretty much anything that's actually a cell phone.
You shouldn't even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
MP3 is played by everyone, and virtually all the music that comes to you is in this format.
It is among the most widespread and excluding it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The Commission also examined whether the Commission had any doubts as to whether the Commission had considered the measures to be compatible with the internal market.
The best mobile devices also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
You just have to go to the relevant website of the carrier (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could be a strong argument for a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer from operators is miserable and most are limited to the fleeting success stories of radio stations.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a cell phone on their hands.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you'll find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry a pair of headphones or at least handsfree ones.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile phone even if it's at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the music-enabled phones will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone ticket.
The best ones, even in terms of technical aspects, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to 15,000.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous common cassettes or also to the playlists is evident.
It is not a threat in the sense that we mistakenly connect to the internet with our mobile and, consequently, a huge data download account.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (M2 type, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a proper card, it will reach 2,000 crowns.
Be careful though.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have an 8 GB memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 crowns is required.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, you can get your hands on the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent MP3 keys which makes the service as convenient as a single player.
The most specialized of them all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost the same use as an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category as far as price, over four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand cited more arria brings you MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services like their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
He'll probably be here soon.
That the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) also confirmed the remainder, warning that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the whole of the Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of roaming regulation are likely to lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMSs sent from abroad will be cheaper than if sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition on the Czech market.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Council President Pavel Dvořák has already stated that there is no longer any place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It may be true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any frequency).
However, there is still one possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market brought a marked price decline, to which the classical operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, you don't have to look too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the mobile operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
In addition, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, in addition, owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can concentrate on many more specific target groups.
In addition, to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not involve relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators typically go low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS messages that, however, are often countered by the more tight service offerings.
For example, mobile Tesco in Britain offers SMS at least half the price compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a no-brainer target group can also be a good blow.
This operator is specifically targeting the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - he's the operator he likes and can be trusted with", says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works with this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could be adopted in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubted this: 'The Czech market is relatively small to access by the segments on which most virtual operators rely.
In addition, the supply of services is relatively saturated.'
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region", Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told mobil.cz.
It indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, they try their best to prevent any potential competition.
Interest in the launch of a mobile virtual operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group which would like to take a step further to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of enterprise customers.
"We are very interested in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to make progress in meetings", said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe better times will shine.
It seems that, from unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now, his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market is a very specific market compared to others.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this area", said Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is also reflected in other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional agreement with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop".
He adds: "It will be difficult to find any virtual operators on T-Mobile's network until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon".
Vodafone is focusing its attention rather on meeting the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of spending and infrastructure sharing.
We consider it precisely the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area lies in the partner with whom it establishes a shared network for fast mobile internet.'
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competition which would lead to a drop in prices and, therefore, a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of that is the lamb when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is attested to by the public information available on the ČTÚ's website.
But right now U:fon is an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "Moreover, the competitive environment in the mobile market has recently opened up to a fourth operator.
As regards the nature of the mobile telephone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would entail high requirements for the latter and, in particular, for its services.'
This is why this access to mobile operators is extremely discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to enter into commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This is purely the case with the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tender (OTC).
However, the Commission expressed its typical attitude to this problem.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator is concluded.
To date no agreement has been concluded as the offer of the potential interested parties was not interesting enough for the classic operators", added Kristián Chalupa, of the UOHS's Department of External Relations.
These statements do not surprise the operators' representatives.
For the offices which are supposed to represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, but they should also note that no one is taking advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign countries where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile telephony services"
The pressure on the proper functioning of the market and the fall in prices are not in the interest of the OHIM.
The really dramatically shocking thing about this whole case is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it's really a coincidence, it comes up on its own.
The same is true of the price of gasoline at petrol stations, as it is clearly the result of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
'The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position and therefore do not have a corresponding increase in liability for their market activities.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as well as telecommunications regulators", Chalupa added to his answer.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is clearly a relevant market analysis carried out by ČTÚ according to which telecommunications are, from the point of view of commercial tendering, a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for a virtual operator to emerge, agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator - with all his logic - has a monopoly on his network.
In a particular segment, therefore, it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are rising dramatically in similar fashion.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators many similar obstacles are encountered.
The responsibility to the CTU is a fairly common trick in the telecommunications sector from which the OHIM washes its hands in all this matter.
We've met him before in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Law was recently introduced to increase the competence of the ČTÚ in the field of commercial tenders, which did not take effect, even though a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known to the representatives of the OHIM, but it is clear that their interests lie elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one's looking
At the same time, it is still working subtly as a pseudovirtual operator that there are already a few in Czech mobile phone networks.
They are companies that set their own prices for mobile services, but only a part of them are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same by ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases like those cited were discovered, it could be said that the terms of the contract were breached and that this could lead to the end of the cooperation with the company", Martina Kemrová said.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, it may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
The activities of these companies generate not insignificant profits and, at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the potential problems: "The law allows for such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that their phone's SIM card is not in their name and therefore cannot have it at all as a normal customer of the operators".
This is precisely what the CTU should think is minimally strange.
A new question for the OHIM also appears.
If mobile phone operators are blindsided in this kind of procedure, why block the virtual operator's entry?
It must be added that the OHIM has sufficient competence to discover these types of activities and if it is not willing it must not be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As already clear from the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market brought a significant drop in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried to protect themselves more or less from this breakout.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the more advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened at this time and in none of the cases have defended the operators but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to bring about the first virtual operator and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority is handling this whole case like a burning nail.
We cannot help but wonder if the confusion of attributions in these cases is a good fit.
But let's not despair.
If this information behind the scenes is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is probably starting to move again.
If any of the operators allows a virtual mobile operator to enter it will be difficult for the OHIM to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one.
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek on the occasion of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solo, one for male and one for female, one with Choir and one instrumental.
The singing is handled by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful.
The Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also, with the Choir to fix themselves in the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance", he commented.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home was first played in 1834 on the stages of the States Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday 1 October 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company records the date when the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at this time by almost 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously upload it to their chip card at the transport company's info centres and stations at the Metro, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka stations.
The bonds can be purchased online from yesterday on the transport company's website, www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred people until the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about ticket stations at metro stations, where until now they had to line up regularly to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the 13 local library branches.
"In these places there is a window with prepared staff available to passengers that helps those interested in buying online and also with the recharging of the bonus purchased on their card", said the project spokesman, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard in vending machines located in some metro hallways.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, reminiscent of a ticket machine and travellers will probably have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty", Opatrný said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just put the Opencard chip card in it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
The e-bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
That is, on the commuter trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
"In trains connected to Prague's integrated transportation there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the bonus", said the ticket controller Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization that sets the schedules for Prague's collective transportation.
Circuit buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver's cab.
When entering the car, you must not only show the driver the card but also accompany him with the Opencard at the place designated for that purpose on the side of the box.
The driver then controls the validity of the bond.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information", Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not travel on the round-trip buses and do not remember when the bonus expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the screen of the machine, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the US in a referendum
The German Sudetes demanded in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
This is what some Sudeten German groups presumably addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are kept in a private archive and that are today kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Sumava land" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators", the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts", reads.
Since the union of Czechoslovakia with the German south-east presumably represents - according to these the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors plead in the letter with the American president to assume for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, he will hand us over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way contributes to the victory of the allies", the letter says.
The authors' inability to sign is presumably due to fear of reprisals from the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president were presumably in doubt about this idea of the German Shumavas, it would be enough to hold a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the US or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of postwar history, may sound a little childish, some specialists say it paints neatly on the expectations of the Germans in the southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to have a slight sense that their expulsion from the republic was going to be discussed, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is even confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
This one was in the war, as German Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, the Czech would be good for them", Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, he said, expected that under the Benes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This is how the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media could be characterized.
The office of the minister, Aleš Řebíček, promises to deter dangerous driving.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in pamphlets.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind you that before you start, you tie your belts.
It aims to raise awareness among young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that fill with emotion.
And that's what the bloody ads throughout the campaign tell us:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't think" is written in big letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays".
This should symbolize that man in a moment of disregard can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
He promises that in this way he will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"The driver is covered by the sugar and whip system.
Sugar is for him when, for example, you pass a red traffic light and thus save time.
Whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks", says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital.
And that is why we need a press campaign and mainly negative publicity, says the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the warning panels for the driver.
"If there is a panel installed warning of any danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention", Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace.
The President of the Israeli Provisional Government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken out on the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in return for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that on Monday it appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means we must necessarily restore almost all the land (occupied) if not all of it", Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll keep a certain percentage of these lands, but we'll have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israel's land) because without it there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would be included.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to go over their legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to surrender a part of Jerusalem", Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city that killed several people and wounded dozens.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic place" that is located inside the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work", he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he sees as an inherent condition for a peace deal with Syria.
But this would also mean concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to get rid of to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Chita movement), they must break free from the permanent support that terrorism causes for Hamas (the Chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are bus hostesses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises whether the flight attendants and passengers can move around on the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the hostess' activity is against the road traffic law", says transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 22-year-old waitress died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only to have the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least secure part of the vehicle despite having reserved two other seats.
However, the bus may have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the exact moment when the stewardship is handing out coffee or newspapers.
The main issue here is whether the bus is equipped, as per the technical permit, with pedestrian seats.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses have no places to stand, the company's director, Radim Jančura, told Aktuálně.cz.
"We have resolved this with the ministry and, in principle, passenger movement is not allowed.
Finally, they withdrew this and we reached an agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat", he told us.
The waitress doesn't know the law.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the hostess - no legal provision clarifies this role.
Even no legal provision forbids transport agents to perform any service.
The road transport law only applies to the term vehicle auditor, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds Hanzelka, who is less strictly speaking.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks, on the contrary, that the law is sufficiently concerned with this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval permitted to have footpaths.
That's it", he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing places and maximum speed limits, interurban ones with standing places with a higher speed permit and long-distance ones without standing places, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP Transport Safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no major problems with the movement of the bus attendants.
"During the journey there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Even here you don't have the security that turbulence will come and the hostess can be hit in the head".
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes obviously the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the hostess must be solved by the transport operator's internal regulations", he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of hostesses.
He's got 200 people on it.
The director, even after the accident, doesn't consider that job risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the hostess position is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive you, passengers, upon entering.
It would even save expenses", he says.
In the interest of safety, Asiana lacks flight attendants in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have hostels, we've been against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy.
In the accident of the line connecting Naples, a young flight attendant from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lot blocking the bus pass without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid him, however, he collided with the front right.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the hostess' rest were sold.
"These sites are not possible to reserve for long-distance connections, they are blocked".
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency won't wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but it expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, not yet.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision about the movement of the bus stewardess in which for a year now thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They are not too much concerned with buses, but rather with the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones during the journey", says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the flight attendants to be a significant threat to the safety of passengers", concluded Hanzelka, saying that the control of safety in buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Occupational Safety.
The hope of Dusseldorf is based in Frankfurt
The letter from the West LB bank's board of directors to its employees is full of words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank's units with DEKA Bank will create a central capital market for Sparkassen's financial group, as stated in the letter published on Monday.
West LB Bank, breaking the 'competition block' with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a starting point for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text is understood when a board of directors wants to show its capacity to act in difficult times.
Because like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the European Union, but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
The Bank of Frankfurt has long been talking about a similar union between DEKA Bank, which Sparkasse's clients know for its investment funds, and West LB.
Frankly, Franz Waas, head of DEKA Bank, when presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, made it clear that he did not see any sense in merging the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA board, which now consists of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, has instructed the board to start negotiations with West LB on common commercial activities.
In this case it could be a business on the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, as the financial site says.
This is not the first time that the name of DEKA Bank, which has 3000 employees, is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003, at one point, the situation seemed that DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed its opposition to Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also didn't find the same language.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate has instead begun dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But there was always a new game with the idea of merging DEKA with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba's board of directors, expressed his opposition to the coexistence plans with his bank.
It is clear that the different banks in the public sector need to be united.
For when the Bavarian parliamentary elections are due to take place, the union of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Ice Sheep, that's not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to rise, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although until now it has stood out much better from the financial crisis than the real estate in Stuttgart and Munich.
The Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba, avoided coexistence plans with the West LB earlier this year.
In any case, it's just the Nord LB.
But such geostrategic reflections form only part of it.
The second is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question on a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end, the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own desire.
The letter from the bank's board also states that a complete solution for the entire bank would be sought.
Since the coexistence of individual parts of the bank can be combined with DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "Italians' weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth.
But this time, he's being assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre barrel of Kaiser brand beer, a huge bear tiger is built showing nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants how low sounds can be made in their throats.
First Elena gives Luca a handshake, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses depart, ` direction Munich, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot next to their flag, the South Americans are singing, they've already started celebrating at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with a leather lining and glasses with silver patches, owns these buses.
For the past five years they have been coming to Oktoberfest, considering that this year alone there are three excursions.
At night on the road over there, during the day on the meadow, at 10.30pm back.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian law of purity, sickness insurance and the German guide.
Buses are already on the road at night on the freeway with the address "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the quiet reigns on the bus, the passengers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian tickets make another stop on Highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group arrives at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are meeting, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letters is Marco's travel office website: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the camp store are opened, it means marching!" cries Marco at dawn.
"March!" March and occupy the back seats in the camp tent.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and you all with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, scattered all over the space!"
A liter of beer, Marco's rye, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip.
Show the security people we have a good tone!
He'll be busy as soon as he leaves his seat!"
Third: "You have to arrive here at exactly 10:30 this afternoon!" Have you understood?
And now everyone is going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the road, ties the yellow caps to the trees, traffic signs and even to a poster of the elections of a major Bavarian People's Party.
You wish you could recognize the way back.
It's the second weekend of Oktoberfest which is known as "Italian Weekend"
There are no exact figures on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the journey over the Alps and tormentingly enter tents, 10 percent of all of them came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive assistance from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes statistics of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, are ahead of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians are in first place.
The Italian's favorite campsite is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister for Finance Peter Steinbrück stressed last week.
The political leader used the word 'relatively' and added that the German banking sector would also be affected by the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich-based real estate investor listed on the DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to help it withstand market turmoil.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters that credit grants amounted to 35 billion euros.
The share of capital that Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to be put in interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as public law banks.
The cause of that is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was lent for long-term projects financed them only for a short period - which is now, due to distrust in the markets, no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank's cash capital reserve has fallen by 95 per cent, to EUR 2.37 million, while the share of its own capital has also fallen slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Compared with the same period last year, continuing financial investment income and net profit from financial operations fell to zero, debt and certain securities tax revenue and those from the liquidation of credit business provisions declined by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high revenue from the reimbursement of the compensation expenses of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the interest reimbursement under the federal tax code and the business organised for the consortium's companies, the negative balance could accuse a deficit of about 16 percent more.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial real estate loans, which served as the basis for the founding of Aareal bank.
Since there was little money to be made from financing state projects, Defa began to focus heavily on infrastructure projects and on financing Community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Hypo Real Estate now has to make amortisations on the value of the subsidiary which will have an "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very imprecise.
It's a fact that they've canceled the dividends.
By 2007 they were two-thirds cancelled.
After the acquisition of Depfa Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial institution in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own customer deposits, it is more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market than other banks.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa's credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report by Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers the group's short-term financing needs with a loan and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets which are now essentially unfit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the assumption that Hypo Real Estate Group's competitiveness is now ensured.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even conceivable that the financing in its full volume will not be needed.
But the contrary cannot be ruled out.
The word was that at the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so the temporary rescue cannot reassure at least concerned people either.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, the course of loans according to the position on the property register is clearly downward.
The loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are particularly affected and the loans whose maturities exceed 2009 are rightly affected.
Following the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa which affected Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans which were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are less affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can start with the depreciation of pensions within the deadline.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining -- the financial crisis is going to get over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-over news about partial statistical, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights sleepless, bracing themselves over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put the end point and use the transport to new loss account for upcoming earnings tax compensation payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and the Bent Secrets?
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop had to apply for the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls started laughing: "German is totally "kawaii"!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana knows Mangas' word - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"First day at a school in Japan.
I was nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in Kawasaki direction and I'm 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, so I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as rigorously fixed as in my home in Lower Saxony.
At 8 a.m. students arrive, at 9 p.m. a small meeting with the teachers begins, the 'home room'.
Before class started, I had to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who likes to talk in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since they still have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my host family's mother and a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, I got dressed like this and I sat down at the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana"... - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At that time I was very happy because I had already started to study this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have been squatting, laughing and making gestures and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I knew her from my Mangas.
That's in the Japanese girl survival vocabulary and it means "beautiful, beautiful".
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt assaulted.
Everyone was talking at the same time, laughing and asking lots of questions - at the same time it's very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then at the recess everyone took off their bandages.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else than boring German breadcrumbs.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and something like meat in tofu dough.
Most of the time I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and they have a new flavor.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe except for the salted plums, buff!
In Japanese schools bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl makes a very artistically made bento for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a play.
I read about it in my manga-comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why Japan exactly?" my friends have asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo for a year of school.
And then he always said:
"Well, because I'm fascinated".
I've been reading Manga for years.
To better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a flair for tradition and customs.
They're very valuable here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still don't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life".
Rats have feelings too
They say a rat or cockroach feeling danger flee, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a neuroscientist, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can we control whether they, behaving in a similar way to us, feel the same way?
For many years, an online magazine called "Edge" has been publishing contributions from famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else could not prove until now, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we get into other species and include questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as the other animals: it makes itself dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, which is why some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
I don't think so, of course.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness from the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (due to their involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including our knowledge of who we are and our ability to plan and decide, there is reason to suppose that even humans are different from other primates.
Another peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not dependent on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of animals, created as it is, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to explain how other animals' consciences work.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has the special hardware, or allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, then their research presents us with big problems.
Most of my speeches concern the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
You could research the processes of animal consciousness without taking into account their contents, and that's what happens during short-memory primate studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essence goes more to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: the two may or may not be alike.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the effect on the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system, a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view, sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex, which distinguishes primates and especially humans.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, fine sensation classifications follow because we can differentiate and classify states using words and grammar to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer to absolutely different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly feels like that in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving similarly feel the same way?
Seeing danger, a cockroach flies, because he's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behaviour does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That's true, the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brainstems, but cockroaches don't have at least one brain.
Is the brainstem responsible for sensations?
Even if it's possible to test it for men, how can you test it for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate rat emotional behavior over emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured in rats and men.
Since I don't research the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
I can't see past my nose, you might say, but I'd rather move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine's ability to host the European Championship together with Poland", Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to be done in both countries".
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lazy.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work at a high speed", said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UFA will not take their eyes off us".
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is not able to follow the rules", Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that".
Only in the last season were many first division clubs convicted of manipulation in the lower division, eventually the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's counterattack outraged
She wanted to promote a new film, she was speaking in an interview about private life - and she has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The delayed war of the two roses in the ex-partner of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and that was very painful".
She only knew the extent of her infidelity after divorce.
The reason for the disclosure of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a failed marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version", the 54-year-old told "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it is "deplorable" that her 16-year-old son, Jack, will again "recall in public the pain and changes that divorce means for a child".
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is remarried and recently fathered twins.
And so he ends his statements by highlighting, "Be that as it may, my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay".
Airline and hotel ticket prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany became even 50 percent cheaper.
Airline tickets and hotel accommodations were again cheaper - a study by travel and financial services provider American Express found.
The company has analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it found a major change in the second half.
After many years of rising prices in the hotel market, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of Europe's 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6% compared to last year.
The trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar, which was the cause of "the declining interest of American tourists in travel".
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial centres such as Hannóver, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, breaking a record in Europe.
In the first quarter airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to rising prices of kerosene, Economy class travelers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights even became more expensive, up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June airfare prices in the Economy class, compared with the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more marked than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9%, and in the second half they fell to 23.6%.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even fell by half.
The reason for the price change is partly the increase in the sluggish economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit-making long-haul flights by airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still not out to score the tenth goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
Gladbach's player started late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he meant in reaction to what happened, he could read clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger at the Hamburg stadium's cockpit entrance.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, rest time was over and most of the people were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist at HSV, enjoying a very high reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That's why your request was noticed by a responsible person.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jollius nodded and raised his fingers in a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: "Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
"Today was not all pleasant to see", Marcell Jansen added later.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his head-stroke; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty win", Martin Jol summed up.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg will be 121 years old.
On Saturday, the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of board on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it", said Marcell Jansen.
He predicts that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of his HSV.
The Quipo with his late players Neves and Silva, the Brazilian goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the Quipo can't shine with his successes.
"We need more feeling and dribbling", Jol demands.
After the vote was defeated
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank bailout package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points over a period of time.
That was the biggest one-day loss in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little bit.
At about 8:30 p.m. one of the world's largest stock market barometers posted a 5 percent deficit at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1,548 points.
At this point the biggest losers on the Dow Jones were American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost almost 12 percent.
No title could be won in value.
Goldmann Sachs' shares were down almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago a big investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The bailout plan provides for resources to buy so-called "rotten" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid out at once, but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the share option receipts for financial partnerships that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden on the state fund.
The stock market in Europe and the USA continues to decline
The billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the US are not reassuring to investors.
The stock price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate is down and has a negative impact on the Dax.
Despite the state-projected financial market rescue the US Dow Jones Index continues to fall.
Losses in the speculative shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite bailout actions by the federal government and private banks, the stock of the Munich real estate financier for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and listed a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Worldwide, financial markets have suffered a downturn.
The opening of the Wall Street Journal in New York City began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout package is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points.
The United States House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue bill, the Senate vote could be on October 1.
The other European countries also knew only one trend: the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent at the start, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia the Japanese Nikkei after profit index fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped to 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India the main index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 units.
After the capital increase was announced, Arcandor's shares lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism consortium also announced that the shares in Thoms Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years now, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's theory of relativity may not be as accurate.
The spacecraft Ulysses spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are heating up now he's threatened with death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes as they gain acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American spacecraft used this physical trick just as the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what surprised researchers for many years: Missiles don't behave 100 percent as expected by the venerable law of gravity.
Rather, they frequent irregularities of speed.
Suddenly the probes are speeding up or down.
Physicists have not been able to explain this effect until now .
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be as accurate.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, which astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth", he writes.
Scientists in the universe have only known about Dark Matter for ten years.
It is supposed to possess the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible which means it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, Dark Matter makes up at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As Italy's foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The kidnappers in Sudan had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shootout during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
Apparently, the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information is presented by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Following news of the release on Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italy's foreign minister confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'We now control his health,' Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are safe and sound, state television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shoot-out before the hostages were released: According to descriptions from an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom", said the guard.
It was just about "receiving hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two of them at the Sudan, Chad and Egypt border.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, the money was to be given to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to stay in detention until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stepfather abuse "leaded to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman killing herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigation, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court learned that Mrs Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After their divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Ms. Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now appeared "emotionally dead", as if she had "renounced life".
In April 2007 her real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ends with: "I used to tie her up and sell her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen responded to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clear, if she hadn't, the matter probably wouldn't have ended in court".
She added: "I have noticed the effect that Stephanie's father and mother described the abuse on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future".
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a business trip for the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
Surely this is the least serious charge under the law and does not indicate any intention to commit a crime.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner reported that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet", he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service pointed out that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained classified information about Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of over £80,000 after the Bradford and Bingley bank bailout.
The Government has provided £14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the savers' money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime is assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial firms with deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently... are called upon today to pay the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
This means that each company had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits and the intermediary companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover £81,000 to meet the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general director of the Trade Association of Building Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent".
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price", added Mr Cole.
The interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest due, which may be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations and have no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher fees or lower interest on their savings.
Milk prices are up five pence per liter
Jersey shore residents will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will rise by an extra five pence per liter from next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February and following the investigations carried out by a consultancy firm.
Merchants can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the price of milk had risen higher before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, saying she could be jailed when she returns to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption charges against him.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, supported militarily, first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is unclear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Your lawyers say they'll appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina arguing that he could not get bail because he was already under treatment abroad on parole", said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court".
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan  says the UN - have not been able to benefit from a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of officials while they were carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge to ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission following the decision to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Court that it will have to reduce its 17,9% stake in ITV to below 7,5%.
The Commission previously argued that BSkyB's interests hinder competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Antitrust Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the ITV stake raised doubts about ITV's independence and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's chief executive Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, it would have delivered its voting rights.
New research on the hiring of US lawyers
The United States Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the inspector general of the Justice Department criticized the actions of the administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former General Producer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved", Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the report's main recommendations was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to give their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from office by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not been assessed worse than their colleagues, and many observers concluded that the firings would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the pursuit of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
And they can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The report of the Attorney General is highly critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, who "abstained" from his leadership position and was "notably uncooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition would be "an honor".
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of the album Meat Loaf triumphed with in 1977.
The Coldplay group is taking the nominations for this year's awards and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them".
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal ability like that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hymn.
The song was first released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained in the charts for about nine years and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after collapsing during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cords.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The little street is in the East Village and extends north of First Street  before I found Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little alley, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alleyway rather than an active road.
There's no sign of him.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to repaint Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbors who commented on being delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block's past before the building's appropriation.
However, the city's Housing, Conservation and Development Department, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community's Land Use Committee in Vencededa this month, representatives of Avalon drafted a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, District Manager of Community No. 3, said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place", said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street".
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month's meeting.
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of making it a public area", he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Conservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opens at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the footage of the establishment that appears on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent", commented Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the East Village's upheaval, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece, a city slice that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk from the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow, no-going alleyway, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with weeks old newspapers blown along the drains".
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was curing through the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB, which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested you could give it a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life", he said, "in dark, wet, and disgusting places".
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior fellow in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice".
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a tough business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning outcomes, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English-speaking students.
The question open to Mr Obama, however, is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English in the classroom, will be effective in overcoming the gap in final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and from low-income families:
More than a third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning English.
Yet an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been rated positive on the 2008 math test.
And almost an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competence and does not tolerate any kind of excuse attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school's approach to teaching English to students is in "total immersion".
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the content of instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We've had extraordinary successes with students like this one who's recently arrived from Mexico and that if you walk into the classroom 12 months later you won't be able to pick up what was".
"It works", he pointed out, "we think it works".
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians in his party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their own constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr Obama's prediction of the answer.
While it is true that immigrants must learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish".
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the education models that work well, rather than scorn or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday because of concerns that the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before falling back again, due to the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest bailout in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
The latest developments in the merger process confirm that Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, according to government statements on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue deal "seemed unable to revive market sentiment".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to drop.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates will be increasingly uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities cannot escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China".
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the coming year, as oil consumption declines due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast for a 20 percent drop in oil and gas prices by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team set record
After spending the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
So he saw how things unfolded in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a game of deflation.
"I've never seen anything like that", Ellis commented.
The second quarter started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had played lazy under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles scoring a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, when the evolution of the relationship between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth quarter, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came in with 10 seconds left in the half.
"I did not go out of my way", said Favre of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think".
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the Cardinals defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss by Warner.
In the last turnover, the mistakes forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him a 20-yard field goal to win a definitive 34-0.
That's the biggest points the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
Team coach Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was answered both ways - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third quarter.
They've scored a lot of points in a very short period of time".
Gebrselassie rested tops his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has proven why many consider him the greatest runner in history, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person to run the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the flat-race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has broken his previous record of 2:04:26 set last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the clock race to the marathon.
Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Beijing Olympic Marathon last month, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution will worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using an average of about 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distance runners, the marathon record has shrunk by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
Obviously, the suspension left him cool, not rusty.
"I am very happy", Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I got some doubts, but in the end everything went well".
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Eastern rival - for the style of orchestrating his races too much, generally avoiding encounters with many marathon stars around the world, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish Gebrselassie's greatness as a runner.
This Sunday, with four Kenyan riders marching, Gebrselassie reached halfway through the race in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers declined.
But just three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took one last push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not participate in the Beijing Games so she was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best record in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did a smart calculation race, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners do the head-on, and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and the trials of colored life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the great Orlando, a few miles from the bright, noisy and colossal city, lies a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-populated city incorporated into the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 black men, 300 good swimmers, many gay bars, two schools and not a prison".
It's now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described  making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression season - remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what he's missing".
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in the face of the outsider.
"We're very careful about the way our story is told", said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right".
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It's also a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a poverty level twice the national average.
It's a literary center, but also a fine example of the rural culture of the black South - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder the people here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as nobody here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten inside black history and human drama.
With a concrete face in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Outside the road on the left hand", he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write".
She also mentions the widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitory rooms".
So in just a few hundred words Mrs Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized citing men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that".
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today prides itself on wearing dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora", Mr. Franklin continues.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long".
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her legacy was understood", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain twist came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys, they went around the city throwing oranges and everything at the people who were sitting next to them", said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl once, too.
He was thrown into a watermelon in the car".
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honored my race".
R Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of its youth.
"Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember this  I used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night", said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from different places.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there", said Mrs Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons  black writers, actors and artists who went over prejudice, as she did, with buzzing, confident and lines like, "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand that".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposed highway.
"The resurrected idea of the five-lane highway, would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride", said Mrs Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
People from out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, started showing up in large numbers, and residents started looking back.
Eatonville was added to the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006, on a redeveloped and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like a street from the past in a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of Eatonville's history, its significance, are often still treated with caution.
A prior permission is required to do most interviews, and some things -- like murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field -- cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community might be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, stupid and mixed.
It's a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare to go this far, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,'" says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it's a very nice city".
Everyone in New York is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the beehive offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York City face the worst "bad office day" since the 1929 crash.
Home delivery guys are still sounding their metal tea carts down the sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag loads of apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric-printed shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning meal to carry, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
Employees still wait in line for their bagels at the vendors' carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five o'clock in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it would take for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkboards, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy's department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people came before me, I was informed later by Starr, my "trusted personal banker", and they were in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places they had switched from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and savings bonds in their hometown whose branches only operate within the state of ownership, and who claim to treat customers like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a ransom buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank that is considered a safe haven, which is what most rescues on Wall Street are doing.
Ordinary people in New York have become experts in finance in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressed-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was commenting on the matter familiarly as if they were complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, 50, and a somewhat uniformed janitor from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the grocery store.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any risks".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria approaches to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria and Filip Dewinter, from the far-right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organisation "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry traffic signs that represent mosques with a red line crossing them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some of the graves, but researchers think this may have been in an attempt to hide the true motives of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's unclear if the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan was ending.
Austria is preparing for a round of introspection following the right-wing turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and also voiced opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the Islamization policy underway in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a travel ban last Thursday after judges produced evidence of Glitter's previous child sexual abuse convictions.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's travel abroad as well as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person".
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being on the sex offender registry.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
You must also inform the police of the planned date seven days before your departure.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risks to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the rape of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Magistrates' Court in Uxbridge, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source in the Ministry of Interior reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and glad to know that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"Capture the master off stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels or flyers or opening costumes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
Next to the artist.
The other, the person.
They're inseparable except in privacy, in those moments outside the public, when they find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a handful, careless because they're not going to come out on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatrical nature of some stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, increasing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, when viewing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy on stage... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco players with the camera".
With the flavor of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, remind of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the act of dance, singing or touch itself, but the artist's personality, his character, that captures the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the creature that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being is and has been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
Known figures of the flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTproject" ("Portraits of Veteran Athletes").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to meet them and to be able to enter an instant into their lives, whether a long or short one.
I think that within photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who sometimes you don't even know, or who only leave you a few minutes to take a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
This collection of contemporary flamenco portraits entitled "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Fotomata Gallery, located at 20 de la calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where you can visit until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It is set in places he doesn't know yet and deals with unknown issues, but even so, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to carry out the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday on his way through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies him today "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and hope to finish it sometime", he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the leading figures of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", - filled the theater's Juan Bravo crowd.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience to whom the hour was made very short in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "the pleasure of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes "in a disciplined way" to fill his "lack of inspiration" with an intense documentation work, correcting and remaking much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience", stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more uncomfortable", so he asked writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "take on with responsibility" their vocation.
Climatology is shortening the Pozoblanco fair which also runs out of regions
The celebration of regions that closed the subscription of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Weather inclement weather has been clutching at this fair, as two of its three festivals have finally failed to be celebrated.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a lockdown in Castilblanco
So, only Friday was a party.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante broke his two stakes with greetings and an ear, which conceded more tendons than his bullfight.
That's right, even worse was El Juli, who went through the Los Llanos thing without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief act, he won the bronze of a large part of the audience.
They skip a check in Alava in a van with 2,000 kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
The agents stop the two occupants of a van and they begin to flee.
Its cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The agents pursued and detained one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., the Interior Department of the Basque Government said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of a public document.
The incident occurred when several officials from the Traffic Unit of Álava were conducting a transport control on the N-1, as they passed through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were preparing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arsenic, at which point its two occupants leaped to run through a wooded area.
The ertzains finally gave one of them a shot and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish loads, so they moved it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drugs.
In addition, officials verified that the registration was "folded" as it did not match the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of falsifying a public document.
Ertzaintza is continuing its investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as stated, and determine the origin of the apprehended drug.
The detainee, A.A.J., 28, was transferred to police stations to perform the corresponding diligencies and will be available to the court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of some drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness has detailed that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping deep on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and going back and forth passed several times over his sunglasses".
Shortly after, the witness, who apparently had not recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented", so the agents took her to a drug and alcohol specialist center to run a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excessive alcohol was ruled out from the start, although "as observed by officers at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and entered the local jail at about 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of a treatment clinic in Arizona recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
IU's general coordinator and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that must make a decision on the case of former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Sevilla City Council, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of making favors to family members.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competencies", Llamazares said of the action that the party must adopt with the one that until now councillor in the Sevillian consistory.
However, the IU leader defended the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into irregularities Silva may have committed: "IU has always defended that these types of matters have the highest degree of transparency".
In the same vein, he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public posts".
'Blood of May', the epic gamble of Garci
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, is set to premiere this Friday in cinemas, to become a future mini-series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci says he has fulfilled this shooting "a childhood dream", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2nd in Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to portray with decorated and appropriate clothing the portrait of "an atoll-bound Spain that was mistaken as the boss to fight for, since the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a financing like Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de mayo-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated almost all his career.
The director of "Return to Start" has therefore focused on his usual way of working, staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and those who do not cast, because he considers it "humiliating" and considers that "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and cinema to learn what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the performers he matches in Sangre de Mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee - one of which he won -, Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood, Seven French Billiard Tables and the final selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that should be known", he said.
With this movie, Garci doesn't expect any prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making another film", explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a freestyle dancer and a specialist in oriental dance.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented women's free movement.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was amazing".
According to the dancer, "we don't intend to tell her life but to pick up her spirit.
The titles of their dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" a few tangos.
Their dance was sensual and I've been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic", she says.
The installation features two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of his shows, as he did in "The open door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilde makes Torttola the senior, the character of maturity.
I'm happy that you've accepted to act in my play and I'm very honored".
The installation also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all their extension, and who are always in love with them".
The work also tells of the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she is one of those women who have a huge influence in a given era and now nobody knows and much less values her work", says Bayon.
The show will start today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "Diary of a Reconduced Poet" at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the passing of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-issue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
The Ministry of Culture of the Andalusian Junta has also acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Poet Reconcasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Ausance of Malice", and gives the idea of the American cinema, and of all America, being helpless to the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
Still, it's been a blast for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of his existence".
No one was afraid to make a fool of himself or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and the country had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and men are virtuous and few beings to admire remain, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn who died of an overdose to his brand of home-made and organic food.
A gift to a country that has had to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without regard to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not one man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing more or less than the peak of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us all very high on the bar", observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping the demand for probity high and for a serious private life away from the cameras.
This isn't always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their example.
He divorced once but then was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when chances were sure to spare him to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger outside the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven, he is helped by the pride that on earth his daughters match his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as his devoted husband, loving father, devoted grandfather, and dedicated philanthropist", they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is for an Olympic Games to be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
They called it the perfect race, and in my opinion it's been the worst long-distance race I've ever been in.
A heap of misguided things which, of course, if you considered it as an assessment and I examined it, would be a very clear suspense.
But let's go through parts and start from the beginning.
The unnecessary starts with the back pick up, which makes you have to go earlier.
Which I don't think is bad, but if they're already making you go they'll give you everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, not at all.
Here they just made you go pick up the backpack (first purpose, go just for that) and (behind the pertinent tail), surprise, there was just size 'S' for the T-shirt (second purpose, because I need a size XL)
What kind of world are we living in?
Or have you decided to buy only small t-shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a nuisance compared to those of race day.
Aside from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes of waiting was incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we hadn't left our backpack yet, although once we did, the pick-up was worse.
In addition, the rain eased the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was accompanied by connotations of popular rebellion and assault on the house.
I think about 500 people are probably going to have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up at the right time in the rankings, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn't mark my exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect career, this wouldn't come to my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown an advance in a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of AI with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, like asking for a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) by listening to what you hear in conversation.
With a camera and a system for recognizing shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group the participants according to the groups of conversation.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and says he'll be there soon.
All without a blue screen.
That's really impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there's been a lot of talk about a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with essentials instead of commercial garbage loads, they would go five times faster -- man, Steve, it's gonna be for less.
A whole new finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing its importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many correctly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the hardware and software to understand each other.
You perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true, you know.
It will never go away but the "death" of the operating system must be thought of not as an absolute truth, but as relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more attention to the web browser.
The computer starts just to run Firefox or Explorer -- or Chrome -- and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What's half the apps that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I'll give you a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft's employee lounge rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
In the soda machine, a sign asks them to use their search tool -- "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive in early 2009 but at the end, rather pulling into 2010.
Microsoft is probably looking for a joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to cost.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the muscular gay parish uniform.
And if we start listing stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that pointed- mustache forklift that was lifting weights in a walking circus.
It's basically just the typical men's underwear shirt in cotton, strapped and sleeveless.
The 'tank', as the English speakers call it, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles splashes over all the others.
First, by her flamboyant name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - she is related to the sport because she gets her name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above all others for its excellent cotton, unisex cut, distinctive shield and the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag that the most iconic shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, seamans, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for comfort underwear.
It's a shame to leave them as underwear, though.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not stopped him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is tiny but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they're more than just pretty, famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm does in its new headquarters, in addition to presenting the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins in short distances.
Tell us about your work in Paris.
I've come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have devised for Mango in this new fall-winter season, as well as attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but at the same time exciting day.
What's your new Mango collection based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both love the cinema of the 1950s and 1960s, and we get a lot of references from that.
Then I like to get lost in a city and watch women dress up, combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it all comes together and they have a lot in common.
I liked clothes as a child; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to peek into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
You know, dancers like to make our own style for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you get the wardrobe is when you actually find the character.
So, everything is coming together, that's right, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You've recently turned 30, have you had a crisis?
What's up?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that women are made, experienced, and taste life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
I've done the things I wanted to do since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me to, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you're looking at several releases you shot last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can't be.
I'm looking forward to the release of The Last Hour and In Search of the Tomb of Christ.
Let's see what you think.
You debuted on a runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
Not that I'm going up a runway to model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, to invite me to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization Women for a Better World, and the clothes we exhibited - I pulled two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned off to raise money for this NGO of Naomi's.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
There's so much to say about her that, as I know her, I'd tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'm stuck with that good part she's involved in.
He asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if he ever asked me to make the pine, so too.
For benefiting the women of the Third World, whatever it takes.
Drivers who have a relapse due to alcoholism must install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholism to have a system installed in his vehicle that prevents the vehicle from starting drunk, or if it doesn't blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, which says it is a pilot project that will last one year.
The purpose of the training is to reintegrate the driver, so he will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the Attorney General for Road Safety, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers who are reported to have been drunk more than once return to their cars.
The alcolock would prevent this as it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the alcohol rate in exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected above the permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros and would be paid for by the sanctioned person.
In this respect, a 2007 US study showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain, it's estimated that it could save 115 lives every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviours before they lead to criminal offences.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to implement the reforms in the field of criminal law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been experimentally deployed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE to install this system in school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without peep-toes
With British timing, at 17.40, the time set in the program, the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico DF.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to watch the royal couple get off the plane.
On the steps, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formally travel.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 Marines performing the salute.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, blushes the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had communicated to her that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a stop-squat to the photographers before they go to the room where the official squad is waiting.
At the door of the hotel they are staying in, one of the four largest in the city, a dicharata reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The most gifted fashion award
There may be no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and there may not be a more exquisite living designer and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to boost the international projection of new fashion talent.
He is awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her designs in the Mango window at number 54 of Paris' Haussmann boulevard and almost cried out of emotion.
By the way, it's the firm's second largest store in Europe and it just opened with 1,335 square meters of floor space.
The first one's in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the competition, led us to end up at a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the most exquisite Chagals nearby, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with her heart broken and heart breaking, at the recent death of her brother, put on a suit from the House and some ELAH accessories, which cut her breath away, and from her son Luis' arm - a cannon nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino to preside over his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, was doing the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both borrowed them from two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store in pants and a shirt - her own design - and for dinner she changed into a long black sexy dress, was moved when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the ballet rehearsal room and she, recalling other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a big plie.
Inés Sastre didn't stop by the palace but showed us pictures of his son on his mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to cheer up the sight with the presence of Olivier Martinez - another gunman who travels on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Paris Intercontinental Hotel, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked that there be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the stress number
There's not 1000 but 1000 plus a way to forget the chaotic, frantic everyday life.
And if it weren't for that, they're all gathered together in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself caught up in the hectic pace of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer is back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection from the world of work.
No, the number is, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects a whole menu of possibilities tailored to each person's taste and minutes in a book.
The anti-stress book is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calmness will reach the bookstores of the Pearson Alhambra and DK publishing houses.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'handbook' denies such a belief.
It also offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore balance to your body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and concentrate on reading.
Speaking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very freaked out telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they're sleeping.
The first time it happens you might get scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign sleep disturbance called sleepwalking.
It's quite common, especially in children and teenagers.
I'm sure more than one person has heard that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime nausea (going to sleep) or sleepwalking, but they don't have to be.
As we mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fever patterns, stressful situations or over-excitement.
It's a little-studied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a murmur, or the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches, etc.).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if there is any issue that is generating much anxiety and thus gives him a way out.
We've said it's a benign disorder, so it's not treatable unless it's associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it's associated with sleep apnea or a stressful picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or slightly violent.
With children who are very nervous and who have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a measure of inner calm.
This will help the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
Once the sleepwalks appear, try to stay calm.
Remember, they're harmless to the child and the next day he won't remember anything about what happened.
Useful Tips
You didn't wake him.
It's useless, because he's unconscious, and you'll break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's asleep and therefore resting.
Remember, if you are feeling very anxious for several episodes, you should consult or find out what is causing such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the usual), do not be tempted to ask him questions to get information.
You'll get nothing, because as you sleep, you're not conscious enough to organize your thinking.
You will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the kid you can question him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That's a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's not bad at all, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
They'll have it at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found its way to victory on its field after a long period of shortage.
Without having played a good match, the team created many goal opportunities and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very steady during this encounter in which the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rub the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was almost to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn't let the midfielder pass and we only left Riahi in the offensive position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two Riahi and Temporale goals for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens with the Marais goal, well placed to pick up the ball thrown in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhousiens goalkeeper will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to his wardrobe a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven Illhousiens who retreated a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major rush, the ball passed very close to the cross-country field.
Sarkozy finds the angry fishermen
Before he leaves for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a round trip around Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet his representatives there.
These promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and expected him to "come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit coincides with the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by the Breton fishermen to take action against rising oil prices, which is a record high of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesman for the Eliseum, David Martinon, the President "will discuss with them solutions that can be devised to help their companies become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and sailor remuneration".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on his feet.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted operations to reduce traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
A "filtering barrier" has been set up on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, scratching at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports along the Atlantic and English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the Bous stayed in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movement of the merchant ships.
Fishermen in La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped the blockade of the important Total Donges refinery in the afternoon.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday to be held at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen have not left" and "they do not want to move to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline fees, currently pay about 50 cents a litre but consider that the financial equilibrium of a ship can be reached with only gasoline at a price below 0.30 euros a litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of Two Men and a Fate has died of cancer, aged 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its forecast for delivery in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its forecasts for deliveries for 2008 with 215 delivered aircraft, Embraer president Fredrico Fleury Curado reiterated.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for selling aircraft with seats ranging from 30 to 120.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would intend to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which has been taken out of trouble by U.S. monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its U.S. retirement insurance, the paper notes.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine potential sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of the companies AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings, its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times reports.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting it with the appropriate proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: The Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, a loss never seen on the stock exchange of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, the day when trade resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis early in the session, Wall Street sank after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plan to save banks that would have allowed it to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, that Congress is unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how far the market had come with this plan", added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would arrive "too late".
"If the project is really dying . . . the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the US central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further", warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Mrs Piegza stressed.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt last Friday, authorities arranged for Wachovia's banking activities to be bought by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing "not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis", added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell by 3,632%, compared with 3,827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4,161%, compared with 4,357% the day before.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
Friday's first debate between the two candidates in the White House followed another to find out who won between John McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen considers John McCain's performance, while honorable, not "brilliant enough" to allow him to slow down in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), judges it to be the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama won with 39 percent of respondents, while 25 percent of them give McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected performance of his fellow candidate, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts", Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain highlighted his undeniable foreign policy experience, underlining his opponent's "naivety" about these issues that were at the heart of this first-time CAREO.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Without being confused, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions, and to restore America's image in the world.
"McCain hasn't understood yet, while Obama has", replied a Democratic television commercial this weekend that blamed the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama reported yesterday, before 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He didn't utter the words "middle class" or "workers". "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable figure of saving the economy that is on the brink of collapse.
"Next week could be a decisive episode", estimated influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic nominee, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy put in place by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless reduce taxes for 95 percent of Americans despite Wall Street's highlights, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his top priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a 45-unit nuclear plant park by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates avoided the questions related to the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, "have you noticed the election in Minsk?"
Young people and opposition demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of polling stations in Minsk's central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "The dictator, he must resign".
Some admit not to voting: "Why, since they will do what they want with my vote", says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime which has put foreign observers in good stead in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to bring about democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
"We were placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the vote count", lamented Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroupment of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change", stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our house, the executive power.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
"But his entry into parliament can mean television appearances, regional meetings and bill proposals".
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt to Russia, goes into crisis, and we don't reform, we're in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent".
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not recognise the validity of the vote.
It stresses that the turnout figures appear too high and that the widespread use of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has favored manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? " he asks the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who are best suited to power".
The silence of the night returns again in October Square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - Blood is safe again
HEMA-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to be happy, because HEMA-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And most of all, it regained the public's trust that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, to clarify the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not recur.
While Judge Krever was delayed in presenting his report, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
Following the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been set up in Canada: Hema-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when HEMA-Québec began its activities, almost 38 percent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After making many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence", he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary recalls, however, that "confidence is extremely fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, HEMA-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing the birth in Europe of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Decary says.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
We then rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we don't know and when a serious disease can arise from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago, it was proved beyond a doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied made sense".
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV screening technique was introduced: nucleic acid tests that allow the presence of the virus to be directly detected in the blood of donors, rather than antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used up to now were based.
Nucleic acid tests shortened the time between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We can substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are unwittingly infected and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before anyone is infected with HIV.
So since HEMA-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products every year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission from a blood product occurs.
I believe that you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health without worries today", says the head of the management of HEMA-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year, Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant", Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
"Needs increase as the population ages.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet injection.
The aging population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average only groups 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation".
However, all healthy people aged 18 and above who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is rampant, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Hardship is very rare.
But the members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it's hard to convince people to donate their blood, but most importantly to keep them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since today's life is so rampant, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating their blood", says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, HEMA-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases like leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, the bank placement of our 1,000th umbilical cord blood sample and are expected to draw more than 1,000 of these a year.
We should start proposing it for grafts early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this", since HEMA-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in every hospital in Quebec.
Softball - The impact on the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL First Division knockout series, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 in overtime) against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarter-finals series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goal opportunities.
Roger Levesque was the only one who broke Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first round of the home-and-away series on Friday, Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon at Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the home game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps did however advance to the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn cheered the attack on a 3-2 win for the Canadian at the free throw barrier against the Florida Panthers, yesterday night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev won the match scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel comfortable".
He tried to play his best in the first half, Guido Carbonneau noted.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation".
Charest takes care of the North.
The Prime Minister does not rule out starting elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council is over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected during today's by-election.
We must reject the limits of our last great northern frontier: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with a visual force while standing in the broad lines at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, were projected images.
They displayed, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used effectively.
The prime minister thinks the election will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very busy.
The Northern Plan is the fourth side of a vision the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister however limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel in immense potential", but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, which is doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This territory twice the size of France is our home, it's in Quebec.
It's not just our home, it's in us", he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future", he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The north, 70 percent of Quebec territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It's a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion comes, I repeat that position from the government", he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North", he said of the northwest passage, which will open each year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Quebec MP for Ungava), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals before us, we have thought differently about transforming challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's rise to power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes renaming the Beauharnois Centre into Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, to Lesage who made the revolution quiet and nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future", declared Juan Charest.
In the press conference, he invoked another, conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
The Commission also considered that the Commission should be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures are implemented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty.
"This stays between us, but I plan to be there", he confided to his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, as the law allows.
It stresses that its schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The general council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" that had no difficulty being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcome the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that Landry's government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
If he had, 'we would have made progress today,' said Mrs Marois, next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (voting today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action appeared to support the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show", said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to say last summer that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonoring this woman who fought a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what it says about the relationship between the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one among all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the events that are being accused of him took place.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves a child soldier to live in inhuman conditions.
The only one who's been playing with a fake justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of abuse.
We still do not realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", which is the word Harper keeps repeating and which makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far wants a minority (what happens after October 14th?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what it did to the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Speech - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining firm Barrick Gold.
Following Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six million euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in cases of defamation persecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to hurt anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the case is of little importance, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada must spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defence and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will numb the opposition and frighten anyone who dares to reexamine the matter.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it's before public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually held for the exchange of ideas and not for the punching of a stick.
The Miner had only to open her books and files and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the matter.
But Barrick Gold seems to distrust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr Garver possibly explain how he can call for a "public" debate while disregarding the views of the latter?
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word only designates highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors have the right to speak too.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal way the miner does.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a "public debate" (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a demand regarding the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr Garver's surreal discourse, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations which form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich corporations of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who can?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to a reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's over-persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It's a loss to the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it's time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months still needs to be confirmed by both houses of Congress.
It provides for better control by the elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new arrangements to contain the number of houses foreclosed on for failure to pay, and a right to control wages paid to the managers of the firms assisted.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon of two-day negotiations.
"We are making great progress toward a deal that will be effective in markets", said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to put the economy and ordinary Americans on the line in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"It's the bottom line: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense", Republican Judd Gregg said.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that a new failure would have on the investors' mood.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the US presidential election, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather favourable to the agreement, but they expressed their dissatisfaction with being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly one that would allow owners to keep their homes and the one about the salaries of the heads of the companies surviving by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, they should not be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary", he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked on another network whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it".
"The important points I read [shows] that it's something we'll have to digest and we can move forward with.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable".
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayer money the dubious debts, risky assets and irrevocable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit bonds (PCAA) and causing liquidity freezes and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of elected Republicans who had the first draft of the agreement changed last week.
We believe we have come out of the deadlock since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of troubled companies are only government insured, rather than bought.
In order to tighten the barrier for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for a first payment of 250 billion, to which 100 billion more may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will get holdings in the companies it's helped that will pay dividends on profits and can sell again when the storm passes.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to delay the embargo procedures for housing secured with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and on cash compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still unsure whether his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both from the Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that "with all the evidence, Washington doesn't want to understand".
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that involves taking advantage of taxpayers".
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is a small group cheerleader in Congress, presents the problems differently, but he comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: we ask the Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken", he declared yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we had once again the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was no longer buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) during the US risk mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money", said the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos, yesterday.
Instead, we regained a voting right in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain".
During this time, across the English Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be buying the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Her blue eyes represented her triumph for so long.
The American actor with a charming smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident would have also moved him away from the record of power that true sacred monsters have.
What a great back runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday, aged 83, from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the 1920s.
He's less phenomenal than Brando, who looked a lot like him and who was long considered a rival in film, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the burst of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes children magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No oversized ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because it projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early '50s studied drama at Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before succeeding in theater, television and soon cinema.
This civil rights activist was also the second-place driver at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With it, the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star disappear, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we don't know very well.
He's an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death has thrown movie fans into a state of vertigo this weekend as his big roles crumble on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh ever-changing American art parade through it.
Many memories come to mind as the charming cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that didn't keep all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This Rocky Graziano boxer, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This cute little man in the sumptuous movie The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
Bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's superb film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar nomination in 1987.
This face that changes with the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him best thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 on The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the Irish mob's godfather in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curve was curved.
Unlike several film legends who left the career fairly early, Newman remained much in the film world, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fastos and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, with humor, "a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and judges his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of a young gal than of a marginal one: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed his true pudding sensitivity to little-known sides.
His 1968 film Raquel, Raquel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
"Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former co-armed Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence"
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the late actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great civil rights, ecology, independent film activist, a contender against Hollywood excesses.
We've seen many of his faces reign over the vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, even though it started out as a gag.
The proceeds from these sales were donated to her Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, rather than settle for his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that included these phrases: "always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing significant damage to the economy, continuously and in an organized manner, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, they used the funds obtained in public competitions for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public and municipal funds - in total about HUF 65 million - were partly held by the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly by private individuals.
The method, which was also made public by the investigators, was to justify the collection of funds obtained from public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
For this they obtained the talons at the market in the Józsefváros District and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question of which company to make the counterfeit invoice was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for his consumption and these served as a model to make the bills they presented among others in the contests of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These bills were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information was writing the reports needed to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this food centre provided food for a group of ninety people from Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the center's manager, not many people fit in at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
A hostel in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, yet the bill was one hundred and thirty people.
But the big-fantastic billmakers also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft. food centre, because in the possession of books of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he already knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and the NIF were in the wrong place on the stamp".
He added that, in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill, 100 people were accommodated, since they have only 11 rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant has been out of business for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organises exclusively travel abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which was not in line with the agency's invoice-issuing practice.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although travel outside the European Union was tax-free.
The VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, and the hotel employees only issued invoices made by machine, but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the 'expeditors' made other mistakes as well, such as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as activity carried out by road transport which - it became known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - does not carry out the company founded as investment consultant.
Similarly, due to formal differences - inadequate form of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont were false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also paid attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation process, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They deliberately dispatched the bills.
Another group of fake invoice makers is made up of those who were aware that they should issue fake invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about HUF four million on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In addition, Biogate Kft. was also involved in the liquidation process with Zuschlag and its partners, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, with no real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, as they later annulled the prepared invoices but forgot to make this entity listed in their documents.
The next group of fake invoice makers includes those who have some connection to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the fictitious Delta Trio SL based in Budapest, which was engaged in the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices for the sale of IT media in the months of October, November and December 2005 worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices for Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt on behalf of the company to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian bricklayers at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they were not given jobs.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company registration documents, they issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for Y-Generáció.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, issued a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor's Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the invoice amount.
That man even used the company in commandite Szi-Beri to issue fictitious invoices used in Biztos Pont's contest.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a tender in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They received 500 thousand HUF respectively from the contest, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
To keep this from being discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably report at trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of counterfeiting the invoices.
The most interesting thing could be the confession of the main accused himself, János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so until now.
The question is, what interest does he have in doing so? Perhaps in return for the return of most of the money - HUF 50 million - the socialists reached an agreement with him to have Zusi assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even offend himself, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own homes for sentencing, he has no chance for that.
Overlapping psychology: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University have discovered the neurological - economic - basis for this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people don't want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups was playing lottery, the other was taking part in an auction, and in the meantime the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system was examining the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but during auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called the stratum located below the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, along with many other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-reward" mechanism.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in stakes is explained as a prevention to avoid provoking an intense reaction of the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists in the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product concerned and its members made a bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but if they lost the auction, the group members lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one, victory was highlighted and for the other, failure.
However, testing the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the "failure-versus-failure" group were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
'These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
The Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the sale of goods.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation". - said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should you see a doctor?
Worldwide, about 500 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are being treated because many of the patients do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for various liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause are very different.
Hepatitis virus dependent on the pathogen is spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
Travellers are advised to protect themselves with vaccines against A and B viruses, there are no vaccines against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and white of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, the urine is dark in color and the healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people die worldwide from cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected people receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment, it can cause cirrhosis of the liver and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know they are sick because this pathogen gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early detection, systematic medical checks are very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattooed people.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can be detected with routine laboratory testing as well, it is worth consulting with your family doctor if you experience any unknown symptoms.
The disease has a cure if it's discovered in time, it's possible to exterminate the virus from the organism, so you can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organisations representing the sick.
The aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of early recognition.
Does it hurt less for those who believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the deaths of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: They analyzed how religious belief influences human pain, reports the British newspaper Telegraph.
In this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scan technique, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of research projects involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University.
The analysis was as follows: They fixed a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings: the Virgin Mary, a 17th-century work by Sassoferrato, and the 15th-century Lady of the Harpoon by Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary show would evoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a calming effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during that period while looking at the religious painting or the other.
Catholics claimed that by looking at the Virgin Mary they felt "safe" as "protected" people, "calmed down and peace reigned in their hearts".
When they looked at the religious subject painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image that is so shocking, you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, like a mother or a father", the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"Exercising faith should and in many cases does change our personality", Wright added.
After these formidable results, one question remains: What effect would it have on pain regulation if Leonardo's Madonna or another painter of his size were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On its tenth birthday, Google can claim: you can find it in people's pockets, as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what they're interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not enough yet.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwellian vision don't see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "gather all the information in the world into one system!"
According to the Google leader, even after ten years of work that has revolutionized the world, the company is still in the early stages of trying to process all the information.
To the question of what will happen in five years, Schmidt answered this: I wish Google could answer questions like "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would suit me best?" - however, software cannot answer seemingly simple questions as long as there is not enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Internet, the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages they have visited when they finish the search are stored accurately.
For example, thanks to Personalized Search, which debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can retrieve what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on previously defined and stored preferences.
What happens if they use my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, the potential of the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of internet users.
Perhaps the most debated example of recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
However, people who are concerned about human rights were relieved in May when the company along with EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated in court that they were right in their litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, by any of the constitutional points, to provide any kind of information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to obtain under the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and about a thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is a rather contradictory view of Google: it is criticized by those who fear giving their personal data because they think that their privacy and privacy are being compromised by starting to use Google's services, and they rebel against it as against the multinational image conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internet users and users from other countries, see in them the next generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so their rival, Microsoft, listed by its Windows as the World Conqueror, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, doesn't ask users for any identification code, or money for their applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet that was created precisely by one of the most talked about keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: show us ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm which offers a list of their musical habits, then these can be included in a tracking system like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which the latest photo galleries that are automatically stored on Flickr or Picasa appear.
We can hear many cases where it turns out that for example the bride, watching the next morning's photo stream of common friends, finds out who her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night before with or may fire a company employee because he writes his honest opinion on his blog about the company's direction: one thing is for sure, the definition of private life has completely revalualized.
A person's online life is what they show themselves to be - this is the definition behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to evade Google's monopoly, can do it (starting with the Scroogle that uses Google's search engine, but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who don't want to sign up for the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but you can replace Google's online apps, from text-writing software to image and news-reading apps with alternate versions that don't connect to giant servers or set the perfect profile about us.
Public opinion is almost openly waiting for the day when Google will show its true face.
The company, now worth $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), and the AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten advertising agencies' revenue, while services that are being introduced more and more quickly cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft but also for numerous other software companies.
Critical observers, however, will also find the contradictions alarming: for example, the top management sharply rejected the employees' protest after doubling the price of the company's daycare, they considered the unlimited number of employees' food too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company under the agreement leaked all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says they won't announce any new service in advance, but only when it's ready to run, which if it's certain is that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will likely rock the world: while some believe that Google's scanning and archiving project of books and magazines will take on such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear its Health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, which could provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, Scroogled, the popular novel by Cory Doctorow, describes in an Orwellian way that future, in which only one man from Google's data can describe himself alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the fingerprints of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to suspected grounds, helped erase the traces of the crime - said Tuesday the spokesman for the General Public Order Commissioner's Office of the Borsod province.
The young women admitted the crime they were charged with, and are now accused of being the proponents of the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency, two girls - will be able to defend themselves on their own.
For complicity, they could get up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant in the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday .
He is charged with the crime of premeditated murder and greed.
During the investigation it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he cited his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man prepared himself much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police are working with an expert to examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
The Polish State holds 99% of the shares and within a few months it wants to sell 60% of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the offer from the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have offered so far.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that in the future the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 per cent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 per cent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis spoke of a "second 9/11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - the Republic of Rome believes - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made in haste, which aims to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it's more accurate to talk about a "second 9/11".
According to a section of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of The World, the mistake of the political direction of the United States was what brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US monetary system is growing and this will then have repercussions throughout the world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington will not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored, points out the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life-saving belts at shaky financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if the dominoes collapse even more bank, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
It is necessary in the long term for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist egotism and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone, the Vienna Der Standard reports, adding that concerns are increasingly real that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to resolve the crisis.
The EU has so far not taken seriously the crisis that is passing like a conch over the Old Continent .
The 'saviors' will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to prevent greater harm?
The smart car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method of developing technologies to prevent collisions, if not to imitate obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the bumblebee.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC Japan, the bumblebees gave Nissan engineers the starting point for designing the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C type of nature-imitating robotic steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During flight, each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, RP and development and research technology director at the exhibition.
The composite eyes of bumblebees play an important role, being able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, engineers used the laser-beam length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor which immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle's robot mimics the movements of the bumblebees, changing the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If it were not so, the vehicle's robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety-protective capsule, in a layer within which all kinds of collisions are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect what a bumblebee does to avoid other bumblebees.
This process must be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of the wheels' rotation
Thus, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the car robot the rotational motion and acceleration plus braking.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh says the important thing is instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process the data, let alone the storage capacity.
This device every second just needs to process some input signals and react as needed.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data from the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
You don't need gigabytes of memory, you don't need megabytes.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately bypass the obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, within ten years will be able to be incorporated into mass-produced models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding obstacles in his way.
This dear boy has a name already
The written version of the law has been prepared for the $700 billion financial bailout package to be implemented in several phases to buy bad loans from banks.
In the first phase, half the money will be spent.
According to eastern coast time during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial bailout package in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chair of the US Congress, stating that the only thing left is to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the finance minister, speaking on the outcome of the compromise, said: "This program will work and be efficient but other measures are needed".
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m. on Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday, Central European time), without causing a dramatic jump in the stock market.
On the bill called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the U.S. Congress will vote first Monday and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program is different from the original proposal of the Bush administration to spend all of the $700 billion to buy bad credit-fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities from credit-fund securities, of poor credit rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, which will also include the Federal Reserve Chairman.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new congressional decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities, as well as other "poisonous" loans.
The purchase can be made at auction or directly - said competent people in the ministry.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial portfolio guarantees the concerns for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said: "The law provides the necessary financial means, which can reach up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it be buying bad financial means, insuring them or preventing risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions".
We are doing everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed", he added.
Instead, bank heads in distress who are waiting for state aid can count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang simply calls a golden parachute.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited and the limitations depend on the form of the Ministry of Finance's assistance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the failed head of the bank retires.
By directly buying bad loans the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the bosses' compensation is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, the existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations only apply to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that a legal limitation on the income of the CEOs will be in place - said the measure by Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, as they will ultimately be able to even make profits from the transaction once the economy and the bank recover.
According to the bill, the president will have to present a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how to return the losses of the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens have entrusted to us, that is, they are not protecting taxpayer dollars", said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said he was urged to take the same measures that are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, national industrial sales prices increased by 0.1% compared to last month's prices and by 12.9% compared to August 2007 prices - reported the Central Statistical Office (KSH).
Industrial export prices increased by 1,1% compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3,9% compared to the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 percent from the previous month and by 3.2 percent from the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only by a minimal measure, at 0.1%.
Domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors increased slightly, by 0.1% compared to July.
The largest increase in price volume occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to a 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and a 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of basic plastics and chemicals resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical production sector (1.6%).
The price decline was seen in the petrochemical sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9%) and - to a lesser extent - in the wood processing sector (0.1%).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing did not change.
In the rest of the processing industry, prices increased by 0.2 to 0.9%.
The supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent a significant weight in domestic trade, increased by 0.3% in August, primarily as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from 1 July.
In a comparison period of 12 months, the largest increase in prices in the domestic sales of the processing industry was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4%).
The metalworking sector saw an increase of 13.2 percent, while the food, beverage and tobacco industries, which are of decisive weight, saw an increase of 11 percent.
Prices decreased in the textile industry (2.5%) and in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3%).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1%.
Over the past year, prices in the global processing industry have increased by 10.2 percent.
Prices for electricity, gas, heat and water supplies surpassed previous year's prices by 18.7%.
In August, the largest monthly price increase (0.7%) was recorded in the investment goods sector among the different sectors of domestic trade.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3%, while in the energy and intermediate sectors there was no change from the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest price increase was in the energy and intermediate sectors (16,8%) compared to the same month the previous year.
The consumer goods sector declined by 6.8 per cent and investment goods by 1.4 per cent.
The export prices of the industry calculated in HUF increased by 1,1 percent compared to the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3,9 percent.
The national currency's share in one month fell by 1.7 per cent against the euro and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, compared with August 2007, strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, won't you need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the entry into force of the visa waiver agreement between the United States and Hungary around 12 January - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before Hungarians living there.
In his opinion "virtually everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic".
At the same time, he warned that the new system will eliminate the entry requirement, but tourists must register before leaving their country of origin.
As of today, the Hungarian chief of diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewing Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, handing her the Medal of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and holding negotiations with the international policy advisers of presidential candidates, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the bank bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, on Sunday assured their support for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-style negotiations, announced early Sunday morning: a principled agreement was reached on the financial bailout package of the banks.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove they're more capable than their rival to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by putting economic issues first, Obama regained some advantage and the McCain advantage he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for vice president disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly . . . jobs, savings for you and entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are at stake", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that "we're all going to swallow this up hard . . . but doing nothing is simply not a viable path".
The Republican senator said the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the minister of finezas and limitation of the compensations of the executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, instead consulting with the minister daily.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen will likely vote on the bill by Monday.
German-speaking press magazine
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious voters became aware - says Der Spiegel about the weak CSU election result in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for the 'European Union's financial perspective.
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Devors Its Parents" he discusses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Social-Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years was completed: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU got 47.7 percent, down from 50 percent for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernization of CSU in the devastating province of its forefathers .
The social scientists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were far wrong in the pace. However, secularization, educational outcomes and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
The modernisation also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the more conscious, critical and stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in recent weeks the mainstream groups of citizens have moved away from CSU the most - the self-employed, small industrialists, those with bachelor's degrees and those with diplomas.
So the support for CSU fell to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confused situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, but the Greens are still unwilling to consult on the coalition.
The elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders barely let anything of their cards show.
Werner Faymann, SPÖ chairman, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice chancellor.
He claimed that they had in any event disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will choose the opposition or join the coalition, these issues must be discussed without a doubt, within the ÖVP itself.
The BZÖ President, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government", Haider said.
Jároka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equality of Opportunities has opened in Paris today. It is hosted by France, which is also the President-in-Office of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, MEP from Fidesz, in her message to the plenary as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that scourge Roma children and also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of MEPs in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to employment discrimination, Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"Most young Roma have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small percentage can obtain a university diploma".
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevailing foundation of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The European Parliament has also called for a new framework for the protection of the environment.
The earlier a Gypsy student starts school, the more chances he has of becoming an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and must ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education", said Járóka.
The European Union must be united in its objective and active work to speed up school desegregation immediately, and the correct implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Gypsy children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens", Járóka demanded.
The aim of the European Summit on Equality of Opportunities, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting in the context of the European Year of Equality of Opportunities, is to ensure a single forum to promote the elimination of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grant for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be made on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the top of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party chairman and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, remain in office, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress to be held the last weekend of October.
The members of the critically acclaimed duo have made it clear that they are not so attached to their positions.
They were thus intended to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they have only achieved 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopoly" in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, the conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to form a coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that is initiating negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of Free Electors enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was used for the coup by the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, who until now was moving the ropes in the background, described September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be Chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU which played a crucial role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment with the failure, the CSU's losses will not have a negative impact on the Berlin coalition.
This is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexander Lukashenko guarantees in the country, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election result.
While the 10 million-member legislature of the country, comprising one-tenth of one percent of the parliament, has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDCF) expected Lukashenko, who renewed his mandate for the fourth time after the 2006 election with dubious legitimacy, as a result of the constitutional amendment this time would "allow" some opposition deputies to enter parliament.
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate Russia's increasingly expensive natural gas imports and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline that runs through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow entry to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians because of an anti-democratic political regime.
It was a sign of relaxation when the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena than on mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on one third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
The political climate is improving, with political prisoners released and Minsk ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is theoretically a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - said Mr Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears to allow even an opponent into that weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations as the results come to light, but rather tries to convey to the electorate its message about the need for economic reforms.
This is obviously causing us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are making it difficult to distribute them, but even so I see that more and more people are supporting change among the elderly too - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, is not considered adequate even by the pensioners, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country's debt and the increasing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security system "similar to the silence of cemeteries" is disintegrating, Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than a testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of personnel.
But starting today, it starts with this measure against whoever signs up and then goes to the bar for coffee during business hours.
This new initiative was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors", says Brunetta, "are an instrument for working better, with more productivity, more presence and more services", says the minister.
"A new season of responsibility and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism", Brunetta stresses again.
Chigi Palace completes the installation in all the Council Presidency buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
The Secretary-General said there was no resistance from the employees: "there was a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration from them".
In short, no more breakfast during work hours; no more coffee and lunch.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In the case of the European Union, the Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's citizens are able to participate in the work of the European Union.
And he adds that it is necessary to make the public administration more effective
"The last 8-10 years have been doubled in relation to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
So far millions of public employees have joined forces to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the Codacons-backed petition.
"While the Minister of Public Works shows the numbers, the lowest absence from work due to illness  writes the consumer association  the people of 'vacuum workers' are continuously increasing.
There are millions of decent and productive public servants in Italy who have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree".
In particular, the Tar was concerned with the exclusion of economic treatment for sickness due to service; the extension of the time slots for medical check-ups of sick employees; and other aspects of the new provisions sought by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 become permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirms that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, Anmil is celebrating today in all Italian provinces the 58th National Day for Workers' Accidents, which is being organised on the second Sunday in October.
"The worrying data circulated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work is", says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association of Workers' Invalids and Mutilate, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the constant association commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness".
"It has been manifested, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, raise the clamor of the media and the participation of the public opinion, but the daily reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in schools for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to keep the phenomenon alive, not to curb the alarm about the gravity of society, but to apply and improve the legislative rules.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, has stressed "that the phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, that offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to urgently put an end to it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slightly positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive", said Pietro Mercandelli, president of the Anmil.
"We do not want this 'declining trend' to result in less attention, because it is precisely when attention declines that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that in general, too little is still being done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our view, they are necessary - Mercandelli stressed - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world.'
"There is a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, it serves to increase the sense of responsibility on the part of employers in relation to a phenomenon which represents a social emergency".
Mercandelli has denounced "the gradual deterioration in the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of labour" and the "assistance derivation towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - he added  because the fate of the accidents does not have to depend on the donation made available by the legislator each time".
MP3 readers under indictment, endangering hearing
Listening to music at high volume for a long period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
The European Commission, in a statement in Brussels, quoted the opinion of the newly identified European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging Health Risks (Crseri), published today.
"From this scientific opinion  read in the note  it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day having the loud-speaker device risk permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and high-acoustic cell phones may unconsciously damage their ears irremediably", says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific evidence  follows the responsibility of the EU - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What matters is to raise awareness among consumers and to make this information public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and keep pace with new technology.'
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise that it creates.
'Scientists confirm this is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable and similar musical instruments.'
There is currently a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concern is growing as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
These damages can be greatly reduced by reducing noise levels and exposure times.
The European Scientific Committee considers that users of portable musical devices who listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit for maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
This means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Termas of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commissioners will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the town council and the town council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas  tends to underline German  It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse themselves.
There is no excess of role position, just the will to have a place to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March the work will be finished, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June, the Mayor will announce that we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.'
To those who are accused of being useless by the Commission, since their opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be essential.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that turn up in turn.
We, on the other hand, want to look beyond and long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
The Mayor of Rome also points out that "this Commission is neither a useless institution nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the citizens of Rome and will serve to engage and reason the best minds expressed by capital".
For Germanno, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which we absolutely need, thinking with a united spirit about its future".
A future which, as the mayor of Rome points out, "will not be limited to the current communal boundaries but will look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that interests him to pass for independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and strained relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a Web site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big rock face: he thinks he's going to win the highest office the nation has ever had, two governors and five black senators!"
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial in nature and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president?
There is also someone who speaks to the heart but not the brain.
A newspaper in the Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, has written an editorial: Once in the booth to vote, we will know well to whom the American patriot will cast his vote.
It's a side of the American mindset that's been covered up to the last.
"Say what you will, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear, if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before, which seems almost certain the black candidate's success.
Yet despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people what mistakes Bush made during his term. 89 percent said Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq has been Bush's weak point for most.
Whoever takes over the George W. job will have a huge duty to play.
The economic collapse is also felt by journalists, who are now in the press, and many blame the Internet for the "murder" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Yet today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where editors work to produce the paper is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at national level is going the wrong way.
In the local countryside the executive group is 65%.
Print against emission.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are opening a crack on the Internet, seen by many as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that "it will do something good" for journalism.
The biggest breach in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers  or the directors  and the journalists who work for them.
56% of national executives are confident their journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "job safety".
The executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationwide.
For the press staff, it's 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it".
Directors are almost always paid good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, "get sick" all year long.
It's all about the weather.
UNIPOL: Court of Rome, DANILO COPPOLA is still in GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the appeal of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl escalation countercontract.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he obtained the house release, turning it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the property to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the House vote against the $700 million bailout plan put in place by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times confirmed yesterday that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, pro-federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, conservative, hostile to those in Washington and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, that has become arrogant with the vote of the one I spoke to at the beginning.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake is heralding: not only in the United States but in the whole West and not just here.
Both in the United States and in Europe the crisis has long seemed to act as an accelerator of incubation phenomena which with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these is the re-actualisation, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category of sovereignty over a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balances of families living in one country and one state are much more compromised.
The first is that it immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who are electors.
The crisis appears to be global economically but it is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be out of the question or they have little to say: the crucial proof is that the European Union, divided as always between different interests and different state strategies, cannot decide on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the granting of funds: from the moment it comes to court it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market and no organization will likely ever have the same amount.
This new emphasis on the nation-state is in perfect harmony with the crisis, and is of the greatest importance as new economic developments tend to attribute a factor closely linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the web of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future would instead have to take more and more account of the immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, you see, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a confined space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign certainly has many more letters about whoever is not, and whoever has the misfortune of living in a position without crops, oil and water.
I'm coming to the second news that, but, presages a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request for someone who knows how to take matters into his own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, of an economically relevant kind inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a disbelief, intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of Western countries in a growing number.
It seems to be increasingly becoming increasingly clear in various parts of the population that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites which have hitherto been in the ascendancy, their culture, with the comprehensive exception of the term, has made itself time and is more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a nutshell, fuels underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, manifested in an "electoral revolution" or in the sudden changes in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social democratic consensus in Britain, to the revolt of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also the right-wing victory in Italy that has something to do with it).
It is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, I would say, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent what is taking shape today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is renewing, increasing and potentially agitating in excess.
In the face of all this, talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue for walking on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spider-Man.
It's the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come pretty close.
With a sticker only two and a half square centimeters, scientists have been able to have a 100-pound body glued to a vertical wall.
THE STUDY  The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have drawn inspiration from gecko's legs, which are covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adhesion.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the reptile's legs and at the same time "can easily detach from the walls", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's College of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive", Liming Dai adds.
Layers to walk through walls exactly like Spider-Man? Layers, yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronics, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
AN OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of California, Berkeley, is also working on a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers have presented an adhesive made of microfibers such as hair that self-cleans from dust during movement over a surface to maintain a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juice
Watch the grapefruit juice, the orange juice and the apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing the efficiency with serious health consequences.
The risk of fruit juices being packaged as fresh as associated with the intake of certain medicines is repeated by David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who has issued a new alert since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under indictment because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antiarrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
DRAGES A RISK  The same Italian drug agency had made the news in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what is being drunk if a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone is being taken.
Not ONLY the POMEL  Experts say that orange juice and apple juice contain drugs that inhibit the use of drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
This is the message of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan: "These findings are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies which may provide for changing the information notes.
That is why we must always read the medical literature that is presented and if something is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly.
The Economics Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's decisions on economics and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attack, in those days when Enron was breaking up, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A forecast that has sparked much controversy and which for several years was reproached to the economy, but which has now proven accurate.
"I am surprised and a little upset by how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention", Krugman had said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist" but also a "very aggressive" publicist, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism in the Bush administration.
Open Office, the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package
It's the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to attract ever more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the less coarse magazine interface are added more consistent ones, such as support for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention is also paid to multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it by email, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
On this front, you can always create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical Adobe graphics with elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within applications: in the worksheet different users can intervene, avoiding the conflicts of modifications, in the preparation of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, over the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that was in the mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace upon request.
And if the topic of free can be a hook for dissemination in homes, it is in the business world that Open Office tests the suite, tries the big bet, already having several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of the realities that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and mediumsized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened up.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint presentation; Dbase, eats in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows to work on the database; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand already, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl also tested positive for the fourth doping case.
Another positive case in the Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, third-placed and winner of the best climber shirt.
The news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth-ever Epo positive runner of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also Gerolsteiner.
The tests of Kohl's blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the test results confirm that he's positive, the Austrian will lose third place at the Tour and angered by the two years of canonical disqualification.
The head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the news of Kohl's third-generation EPO doping positive, stating to the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has taken the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the top climber's shirt.
Immigrants: The New York Times is asking, is Italy racist?
Italy, a country of immigrants, has only recently become a privileged destination for the hostile immigrants.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? asks the New York Times in a long article devoted to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of the young man Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case illustrates what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those with "more integration and more work" but also the country's highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the Northern League.
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the incidents of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation, which the League wants to tighten the brakes on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic both expressed a strong desire: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedetto XVI in Congress, has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism".
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The university rental market is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenant union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study for a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to bear  explains the head of the studies office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to such an extent that it has triggered a widespread increase process even for residents".
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, no-fee limit, linked sub-rental contracts.
The Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the prices are regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it is about 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, 250/280 euros are served for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (St. Lawrence, Plaza Bologna) you are asked for about 600 euros for a single room and 450 euros for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The economy is made only if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in the Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding areas.
In Naples, for a bed you get 300/450 euros, for a room you get from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, you get 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 euros for an individual.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater impact on the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and extracommunity is more frequent, there is another anomaly: an increase of 25/30% in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel historic theaters
Historic movie theaters close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas in a blind city, is like a face without eyes".
The image provided by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centres and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monohalls in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it's like a friend dies, a acquaintance with whom he shared a piece of space and so much excitement", notes the director of the new Paradiso cinema, the film that twenty years ago won the Oscar cousin and the grand jury prize at Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema hall and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema he lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main trade association, are clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the most to pay are mainly the halls of the major cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 less in Palermo.
The regions most affected by the closures are Emilia-Romagna, with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the cause of its disappearance is the advent of multiplex, it is these three Italian regions that have registered the greatest number of new meticulous cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
The Italian exercise has developed irrationally notes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, 'it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the continuity of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequentors are willing to switch to meticulousness.
Not to mention the lack of funds for the merchants: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral standpoint that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
The sector would need between €16 and €18 million a year to sustain it.
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned about closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema monosale in both the historic centre and the periphery.
Among the rules envisaged are tax incentives for operators and public benefits for mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special parking fees.
It is an initiative I like  observes Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by setting up other measures.
True, to contrast the extra power of meticulously-crafted music, traditional theaters have to improve sound and image quality because the audience today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradiso cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale de via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, to avoid seeing the posters blackened by dust, I turn to the other side.
The link between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the Municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli tick".
The accusations made by the magistrates of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate against the governor and deputy governor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the governor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous to the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any legal and moral norms, and in good faith", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"The mafia family would have been allowed to officially enter the municipality, facilitating the possibility of control and command of the public administration".
The president of the regional junta of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean.'
The arrested this morning are joined by those from last July after the police announced the beheading of the Piromalli family.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been released from the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, UDC mayor at the time of dissolution, after the May 2006 ballot, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition.
I'm making a big deal when the prefecture orders the dissolution of the city council.
I call in question the vice minister of the interior who at the time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political question, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
The judges write that the environmental intercepts made to Dal Torrione show "the willingness to support the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, while unifying public administration elections on the interests of mafia families".
When energy is born of the waves, the big ones come on stage
It's an extinct deposit that occupies over 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's biggest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources that big people like Chevron look up to.
The possibility of energy harvesting from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now that environmental issues and the new rise in oil are giving the sector momentum.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated that by 2007 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there'd be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away, more and more companies are betting on marine energy and among these companies are those who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology", a spokesman for a company associated with the US oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question is about obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It's a pretty important signal, considering that in Alaska the US continues to mine oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to drill new wells.
In addition to Chevron's Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey following the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, because marine energy has no doubt a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts like those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined together.
The force of the waves, which moves the boas up and down, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure drives a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
There are currently four such implants under development, pending only federal approval, apart from the energy, that could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines on New York's East River.
The movement of water when there is tides, causes the turbine pads to spin, creating a rotating motion that powers the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It's mostly about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that are approaching the shores, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
