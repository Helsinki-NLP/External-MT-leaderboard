Total cases of the rapidly spreading coronavirus (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The overall coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) cases show similar incidents in the EU/European Economic Area countries and the UK confirming that, while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly across all countries.
Based on Italian experience, countries, hospitals and care units should increase their readiness for the increase in COVID-19 cases that will require healthcare and especially critical care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia was reported in an unidentified weather event in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 20 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported to the reporting agent as a new coronavirus that is now known as Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
So far, evidence has shown that 80% of people with COVID-19 have fewer illnesses, such as short-term respiratory illness with or without a breast, and most are healthy.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 promotes a very serious illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases experience a serious illness requiring serious care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the total incidence of COVID-19 cases in each EU/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom and compared it to China's Hubei Province.
We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EV/EEA countries and the UK in Italy during 31 January 2020 15 March.
COVID-19 cases in the UK and EU/EEA countries
After China, COVID-19 spread geographically and the COVID-19 epidemic is currently actively tracking the country in the rest of the world.
On 11 March 2020, the President-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic as a global pandemic.
In EuroSurveillance 2020, on 5 March, Spiteri et al, the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Europe was reported, as defined by the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported in French returnees from China from Hubei, and Wuhan on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, while between 31 December 2019 and this date 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone in 17,750 cases.
Total number of COVID-19 cases and accrual
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), confirmed cases of COVID-19 are counted in every country in the world, only obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) every day at 8:00 am.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 incidents in the EU/EEA and the UK, and it is compared to Italy.
As a sign of the expansion of active COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the total incidence of COVID-19 cases reduced by 14 days, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 during the period 1 January  15 March 2020 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom.
We presented the total number of confirmed cases per country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases from the UK and EU/EEA countries
Over 14 days the process was followed by increased incidents of COVID-19 cases in EV/EEA countries and the UK in general after Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the total COVID-19 cases started to rise around 21 February and then peaked around 28 February 2020 (total items).
These were mostly caused by the rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK have also shown similarly increasing overall cases of COVID-19 (supplementary substances).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EV/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
It notes that, at 8am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported similar cases with Italy just 3 weeks ago or so.
Our results show that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The intensity seen in the total incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing comparatively in all countries.
Although countries are in different stages, national public health responses vary, and there may be different definitions of cases, different protocols for patient selection and follow-up testing that must be tested to confirm COVID-19 in countries.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed critical care and media sources reported that hospitals and care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Admission data documents in COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level only for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they must be compiled systematically to complete current surveillance documents/records that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant difference in the availability of concentrated care and intermediate care beds in Europe, with beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany at 29.2 to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (care and intermediate care beds in 12-2010 were 12.5 per 100,000 population).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity centralization, with estimates of each EU/EEA country and UK hospitals with a COVID-19 case risk exceeding the concentration of care bed capacity >90%, were presented in the sixth ECDC on COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
As cases have so far been clustered in some areas in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and care unit units usually determine the regional catchment population, information on cases and care beds should be preferably provided in the name of the regional units for the statistical (NUTS-2) level.
Our experience from Italy shows that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and care units must thus provide themselves with healthcare for the continued social spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, which require healthcare, and particularly critical care, as is the case in affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, active and comprehensive approach is needed to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, in a way that reduces an infectious condition, as the projected rapid increase in the number of cases should not allow enough time for decision makers and hospitals to plan, accept and implement their reflective action if not implemented ahead of time.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity as countries are likely to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and increase their control efforts to reduce healthcare stress.
Failing this, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world and infected more than 80,000. It is a disastrous outcome for humans.
Similar to this homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may spread through evening exposure and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS but is more prevalent and affects older individuals than younger individuals and more men than women.
In response to the rapid number of publications on chronic disease, this paper seeks to provide timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly growing topic of research.
We will cover the basics of disease prevention, ethnology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help us understand and eliminate the looming disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become a unique and memorable memory for all Chinese who have been denied the request to stay indoors for all holidays and weeks due to the outbreak of the new pandemic.
It is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that led to the development of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was designated SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was renamed CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The disease started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to about 50 other countries worldwide.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has generated more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "people's enemy of the first degree" and is more aggressive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), in less than two months more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including its viral epidemiology, ethoology, diagnosis, and treatment. Since the first report on 7 January 2020 that identified a virus sequence that was excluded from many patients.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research in a new and fast-growing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will compare COVID-19 to the SARS and other CoV-induced disease, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).
We will also discuss the prevention and diagnosis of this disease and some of the hidden urgent questions we have learned so far.
CoVs have traditionally been known to be non-fatal diseases to humans, typically causing up to 15% of normal colds.
In any case, in this century, we have experienced twice as many highly pathogenic human CoVs, for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which in fact caused the outbreak first in 2003 in China and then in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and soon spread the disease and death to many other countries with fear.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third most widespread case of COVID-19 in recorded human/human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a breast cluster with an unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven (7) days later the CoV sequence was released.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
At the same time, the disease spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infections reported by healthcare providers suggested that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan City was closed with all public transportation shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the site of the outbreak from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread to China and spread to about 50 other countries around the world. (Fig. 2)
As the situation develops rapidly, the final range and intensity of the outbreak will become more specific.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients including 8,866 patients presented a new updated description of the disease as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ULBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but is most common in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over 50, a very small number were under 20, and only 14 of the infected patients were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected 0.27/100,000 more men (0.31/100.000) than women.
COVID-19 originally spread in clusters in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average duration of contamination was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the regulated R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases has increased dramatically before January 23, 2020, compared to the major transit time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10-1.86), and the mortality rate of all patients was 3.06 (59% 4-02.2 : 95% CI).
Three risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (≥60) and severe breast cancer.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses that contain a sensory RNA unit.
They can be divided into four types, such as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, from which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The Spec-packet (S) glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the deptylated peptide 4 (DPP4) of these cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then the membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome reacts, the genomic RNA forms viral vesicles with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then stop to release the virus through the plasma membrane.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new strain of the beta CoV with over 99.98% genetic identification among 10 sequentially sampled samples collected from the Havana Sea Market in Wuhan, the main area of outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is more congenital than MAR-CoV to SARS-CoV.
Through a transfer balicotron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the human air epithelium ultrasound.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is more weakly linked to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form an unknown short protein that is secreted by orf3b and orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral immunity and take the form of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known active domain or form.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the structure of a full-length human ACE2 cryo-EM in a 2.9 Å contract with the amino acid transporter B0AT1 in the complex.
They found that the complexes, which have open and closed conditions, assembled as dimers and a mixture of ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which provide evidence for identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may be a treatment target for drug testing to bury SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Source and intermediate host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from evening fever and were transmitted to humans through cats and mice, respectively.
By comparing the phylogenetics of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the late detection was the main host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs known as -SL-CoVZX45. bat - SL-CoVZX21
However, what the intermediate host has helped the virus to eliminate the species barriers to infecting humans, and the route of transmission is still unclear.
J, et al., suggested snakes as a virus carrier from the evening primates to humans that were included in the homologous group within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that penguins - long-beaked, honey-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% homology in the origin of the CoV found in penguins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the prevalence of the difference of 1% in the two genomes is still significant; thus, the results of actual and accurate evidence are expected (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physical chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the ventriloquist environment for 48 hours and can remain in the ventriloquist for up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperatures at 56°C for 30 minutes; or 75% ethanol, containing chlorine, antifungal, parasitic acid, chloroform and other solvents, but chloride cannot effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population is generally not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this unknown virus.
Currently, no detailed research on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4) [4].
Generally, after the virus attacks the host, it is first identified by the host's domestic immune system through sample recognition receptors (PRRs), including a receptor such as C-type lectin, an all-type receptor TLR (NOD), and a receptor such as - (RLR).
In many ways, the virus promotes a combination of inflammatory factors, denandrite cell completion, and type I interference (IFNs) that restrict the spread of the virus and accelerate the microfacussitis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein can help to ward off the virus from immune responses.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is joining the fight against the virus.
T4 lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defense of the body.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific viral antibodies, and CD8+T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Auxiliary T cells produce pro-physemic cytokines to help immune cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by stimulating T cell apoptosis.
Neural immunity supplements and antibodies such as C3a and C5a are also required against viral infection.
For example, the antibody of a recovered patient replaces MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overworking the immune system produces locally large radicals that can severely damage the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, cause multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 disease, started with a cluster set, is more likely to affect older people, pregnant women.
It is normal for people who are infected with a large number of viruses or whose immune functions have been compromised, to have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 - 14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on an initial study of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, shows that incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is critical for health authorities to regulate effective quarantine times based on the effective timing of the rule, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected but unsigned people to others.
As a general practice, individuals who have been exposed to the disease or have been infected with the disease, usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The fever is often a major and early symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, joint/muscle pain, dizziness, headache, chest pain, vomiting, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea/wheezing.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have progressed rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with tuberculosis and/or respiratory illnesses and severe fever, even without abnormal lung imaging, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of people with allergies was 98% for fever, 76% for dry spots, 55% for white spots, and 3% for nursing sessions. 8% of patients need outdoor air.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from a non-muscular patient.
Relatively speaking, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) were their main symptoms.
However, 80% of these require air-conditioning support, more than COVID-19 patients and corresponding to higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and chest pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was reported that fever (99-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), despondency (40-42%), nausea (20-25%) and chest pain (13-25%) were major symptoms and that fresh air was needed for nearly 14%-20% of patients.
On February 14, COVID-19 deaths were 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
Relatively speaking, SARS deaths in November 2002 accounted for 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, deaths accounted for 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was as high as 6.47 with a 5.71-7.23% interval (CI) of 95, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for transmission than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Thus, the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster starts often occur in the same family or at the same meetings or car as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a travel or residence history in Wuhan or other affected areas or contacts with infected individuals or patients two weeks before contact.
However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and hospitalized patients can re-transmit the virus, which has sent rust to prolong quarantine times.
Patients have a normal or low number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count <4 × 109 / L has been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with lymphatic number 1 × 109 / L, and high asperitic aminotransferase levels and varicose veins.
Liver patients have elevated levels of liver/blood and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in their blood, and C-reactive protein and erythrocytes degradation has been increased in the blood of many patients.
In patients with severe cases, levels of D-dimer, a decay product of fibrin in the blood, are elevated, and the number of lymphases gradually decreases.
Abnormalities in chest radiography have been found in most COVID-19 patients and are blurred by the darkness of a double-sided patch in the lungs or the blurred vision of the ground.
Patients often develop neural breast implants, severe breast injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and advanced fibrosis cause damage to the gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumonic disorders decrease surfactant levels and increase surface pressure, thus reducing lung capacity and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, radiographic findings of a deformed breast often compare to the more severe range of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 was a synovial analysis of sinusitis, hyaline lining formation, and interstitial lymphatic infiltration, and several disease-causing senicyl cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, according to pathology. Viral infection was similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain interaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key benchmark for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high error-negative rate, which may accelerate the outbreak, clinical statements used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) were used in China on February 13, 2020.
The same thing happened with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Jang Group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 moles/L to 200. -18 10-18 moles/L (10-100 copies per micrometer of the Internet) using a dept in less than an hour without requiring an explanatory tool.
Hopefully, the new technique could dramatically improve sensitivity and convenience if confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with an unknown CoV, therapists can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients while trying different treatments that have been previously used or recommended to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments including antiviral medications, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients received, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Plasma from even the patients received was recommended for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other members that exhibit ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys.
However, respiratory illness and failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is critical to reducing symptoms and saving lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, flawless ventilation, and severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted with extrapolar membrane oxygen (ECMO), a cardiac stabilization technique used to treat life-threatening heart and shortness of breath.
In addition, maintenance of the electrical balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and maintenance of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that Cyticone storms result from over-activity of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cyticone storm is a component of the systematic inflammatory response released by a series of cyticones including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release many free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunity is essential in treating cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Courtier Coosteroids and Tosillazomab, an IL6 antibody, were used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunotherapies for cytokine cyst include T cell-guided immune response modification; IFN-the, IL-1, and TNF inhibitors; JAK inhibitors; blinatumomab; cytokine signaling inhibitors 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as an immune force, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the progenitor.
However, low to moderate-dose corticosteroid short courses are recommended to use with caution for COVID-19 patients.
As of this writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, a vein administration with remdesvir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective with COVID-19 in an American patient.
Remdesvir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Subsequently, the recall also showed possible prevention of other single infected RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Accordingly, Gilead has provided a center to China to conduct these pair of tests on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are highly predictable.
In addition, baricetam, intrirone α, lupinevir/retonavir and ravavirine are recommended as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, inflammation, cough, liver damage, and other adverse interactions can occur after co-treatment with lupinevir/retonevir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used for patients should be closely studied.
Plasma is formed by acquired patients and antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have developed an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from disease prevention has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the disease in their blood.
Antibodies are an immune system built by B lymphases to fight disease and other foreign agents and recognize specific molecules in such diseases and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 more serious patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with decreased inflammation and viral pressures and increased oxygen concentration in the blood.
However, confirmation and explanation are necessary before specific treatments are yet to be developed to suggest a method for large-scale use.
In addition, given its therapeutic effects, some of the risks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can promote an immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat serious patients.
Rapid production of specific antibodies to fight the global pandemic is very expensive.
Thus, it is very critical and practical to isolate B cells from patient cells and identify effective antibodies or test coding or genetic codes against the necessary proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a range of diseases.
However, its effect depends largely on the combination of several components in the formula that depend on diagnosis based on TCM theories.
Many effective components remain unknown or ambiguous because it is difficult to extract and authenticate similar ingredients or their preferred combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the major alternative treatments for patients with moderate symptoms of light exposure or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shen Feng Zi Du capsules and Lian Ho King Wan capsules were found to be effective for treating COVID-19.
The best treatment rates in treating COVID-19 patients were seen in several Chinese provinces where TCM is used in 87 percent of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hanan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only 30% of these COVID-19 patients, had the lowest treatment rate (13%).
However, this is somewhat comparative because many other impact factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boley Jung and colleagues published a study to compare Western medicine (WM) treatment only with WM and TCM combined therapy.
They found that the time required to recover body temperature, to lose symptoms, and to be hospitalized was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most effectively, the symptomatic worse rate (more severe than mild) was significantly lower for the WM+TCM group for the WM alone group (7.4% compared to 46.2) and mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group only compared to the WM alone group (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still awaiting well-controlled trials on large scale and at other centers.
It will be important to identify the mechanism of action and identify the effective components of TCM treatment or, if possible, their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience a severe fear of a highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience fatigue, loneliness, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of illness such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by cartilages can cause excessive anxiety and mental distress.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of mental illnesses including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychiatric fever, psychiatric symptoms, heartburn, and even suicide were reported.
Compulsory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, can make people more concerned and guilty about the pandemic, quarantine, and the detrimental effects on family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people in contact with them as well as the general public who are in need.
Mental support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 disease and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to interfere with a series of transmissions from animal stocks and infected humans to infected organisms and are often complementary to antiviral treatments in the control of disease caused by viruses that are produced.
Efforts have been underway to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and robust neutral antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-fed vaccines for SARS have been evaluated in animal models.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly and lethal-defying models and their protection against zoonotic virus pathogens were determined even before clinical studies began.
This is probably because SARS was wiped out 17 years ago and no new cases have emerged since.
In contrast, MERS-like cases and clusters occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions where the zonotic surge continues in unusual areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for Mers using particulate and reproductive protein subunits such as inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses and some were evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.
In any case, it is challenging to eliminate the problems because vaccine development and dynamic variations of CoVs require a long time (an average of 18 months).
As an unknown disease, COVID-19 has only begun to manifest its full clinical course across thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without a stroke.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with higher morbidity and mortality among patients with severe illnesses.
Therefore, developing a diagnostic model for the disease is essential for healthcare institutions to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with or influence the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also important for COVID-19.
COVID-19 generally developed between the ages of 30-65 years, with 47.7% of patients aged over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive care were most likely to have disorders and disorders and were significantly older than those who were not in the median age range of 66-51 years, suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 compared to 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.
Disorders and disorders: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to have severe heart disease and arrhythmia.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiosites, which may lead to renal/glandular impairment in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and primary disease are closely related and may interfere with each other.
Laboratory abnormalities: Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injuries and have been suggested as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
A correlation of CRV levels with the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19 is also suggested.
In addition, elevated lithium dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransfers (AST), alanine aminotransfers (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in organs, especially in the heart and kidneys/liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, these are traditional markers for the deactivation of the heart or adrenal gland.
Major clinical symptoms: Breast radiography and the temporary development of clinical symptoms should be considered, among other issues, to predict and complicate the outcome of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunological agents used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from isocular osteoarthritis with disability and poor quality of life throughout their lives.
Thus, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As noted above, many patients have experienced unusual stress during the COVID-19 pandemic as they often endure imprisonment and prolonged uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and friends.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients return to a healthy and normal life from stress.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological symptoms from SARS.
In addition to replication in low respiration, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively trigger a reaction in the upper respiratory tract and develop mild or symptomatic symptoms in the first stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause a normal cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the first stage or incubation period can develop large amounts of the virus during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the disease.
However, SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are most severely ill, while most transmission has not occurred in the first stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
There are currently major efforts underway in China, including the ongoing quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities and almost all of the population, to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions are dramatically affecting the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is declining, reflecting the slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the pandemic will end in March and the downward phase will continue for 3-4 months.
Still, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., has predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langeni, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both the mid-turbinate and the spinal fluxes of patients recovered and discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that a newly identified virus could become a cyclical flu-like event.
However, promising signs have occurred in China due to the declining number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually contained.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in infection and eventually die or remain a minority virus with humans.
Comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SVS and Mers provided in Figure 55.
SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible through coughing or sneezing/colding, and may be transmitted through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in human feces, which raises a new possibility of oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were likely caused by non-communicable diseases, including 17 other patients with other chronic diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, human beings should be protected with great care, especially in contact with health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even patients or patients.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from traveling through the air or entering the surfaces of the material, where they can be transferred to others.
However, only N95 masks (series # 1860s) can protect against respiratory microorganisms from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of viruses are able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can enter even five surgical masks together, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers must wear fit insulation to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his burning eyes.
Thus, healthcare providers should also wear a transparent face mask or glasses when working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash themselves with pesticide soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-protection and limit contact with potential patients.
Staying away from a patient three steps/step is called a reasonable distance for people.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a novel virus, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 must have been the cause of China's high alertness based on its deep memories of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until January 2020 that the Director of Disease Control in Wuhan was reassuring citizens that the novel virus had a low and limited human-to-human ratio and that it was not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
The message calmly eased public concern, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival, and lost crucial time to prevent the epidemic at least in Wuhan.
The disease control authorities in China may learn this hard lesson and make important reforms in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when advertising publicly because every word is valuable to the public and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorities; (3) be more restrictive of initially having a potential disease rather than relieving people; and (4) more often publish targeted and effective practices to raise public awareness of all diseases and periodically examine and improve the community response system.
The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the unknown virus SARS-CoV-2 that started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the outbreak has spread to China and about 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the emergence of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for treating disease and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals than younger people and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rates are higher among older individuals than among younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients carry the virus even when they have symptoms while SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, which makes it much more difficult to spread COVID-19 than SARS.
This part explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more quickly and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA Assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can then be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found among SARS-CoV-2 and two Schuperk's-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from Schuperk's.
What was the average animal that transmitted the virus from the original host to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the transmission, and these events can reoccur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical writing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airborne cells and subsequently cause pathological mutations?
Is the virus also binding ACE2 expression cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this disease last?
How does the virus genetically develop during human transmission?
Will it spread worldwide, die like SARS or rise like a cold at the same time?
This is essential but may take some time to find answers to the above and many more questions.
However, at whatever cost it may cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Zoonotic origin/sources of human coronaviruses
Modification and adaptation have for thousands of years created a synchronisation between the coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human (HCoVs) were known to cause a minor infection, such as the common cold.
The prevalence of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) has been mined to reveal how devastating and life-threatening it is to become infected with HCoV.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has taken the CoVs once again to a significant level and we were surprised by its high transmission aspect but lowered the psychosis compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will serve us well.
Most HCoVs originate from shoeparks where they are harmless.
Some intermediate storage hosts of HCoVs are also known.
Identifying host animals has a direct effect on preventing human diseases.
Researching CoV-host interactions in animals may also provide important insights into the disease of CoV disease in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery and the main sources of their zones and cross-transmission.
Importantly, we compare different HCoV viruses with viral evolution and genome synthesis.
The current COVID-19 pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the needs of successful hosting and the impact of the virus evolution on the severity of the outbreak were also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the coronavirus family, which includes a group of isolated, positively-sensitive, single-celled RNA viruses.
These viruses that have the largest genome in the group of RNA viruses of 26 to 32 kilobases and are called "CoVs" due to their crown-like morphology under an electric microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have uncoupled genomes that share the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large open-clad reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 ~ 16
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
A chain-related access proteins are encoded by different numbers of CoVs.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), in which the beta-CoV genus contains most HCoVs and is divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
Polygenetic evidence has shown that rats and mice serve as the gene source of many alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been continuously overcoming a variety of barriers and some have emerged as major human diseases.
To date, seven human (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha CoVs.
The other five beta CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause common symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing low-respiratory infections in relatively large numbers of patients who have a higher chance of developing high-respiratory disease.
The first case of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the common cold virus in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more data has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause symptoms of self-limiting.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted that infected with HCoVs was generally harmless until the onset of SARS.
The SARS outbreak that began in 2003 is the most devastating event in current history, and has infected more than 8,000 people with nearly 10% of fatalities.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic caused a persistent infection in the Arabian Peninsula and would spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel (HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from shark, mouse or domestic animals.
The line of evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from shoepoints, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show high genetic diversity
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the original sources of HCoVs to the zones provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and restrictive factors of species coding.
This may facilitate the guidance or search for the stockpile, intermediate and extended animal host (s) of SARS-CoV-2, which have important symptoms in preventing future spylosis.
In this review we present the zoonotic origin, cross-transmission and the classification of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that HCoVs' parent viruses are particularly non-infectious in their natural reserve hosts but become pathogenic after cross-transmission to new hosts.
We also look at the evolutionary state of HCoV in which increased transmission capacity often comes with a decrease in infection.
The ongoing outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.
Before the initial isolation of HCoV-229E B814 was inhaled from the diet of patients who had a normal human infection, different CoVs were isolated in various infected animals, including elephant chickens, mice, cows, rodents, cats and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and guiding.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of upper respiratory tract patients during 1966, and was later applied to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have symptoms of common cold symptoms, including headaches, nausea, chest pain, fever and cough that have been observed in 10 ~ 20 percent of cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial transmission in the brain of lung mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which in other areas are inseparable from microbes with respiratory disease triangles such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and they are transmitted in warmer climates during the winter season.
Typically, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, and the disease lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to a human-volunteer study, healthy individuals who were infected with HCoV-229E develop a common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have shown severe low respiratory flu.
SARS, also known as "apoptic pneumonia", is the first known outbreak of HCoV-caused outbreaks in human history and the etiological agent SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was detected in Guangdong Province, China in late 2002.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across multiple countries and continents.
In addition to the high prevalence, it was estimated that each case develops to approximately 4 secondary cases, with a duration of hospitalization of 4 to 7 days and viral weight lifting occurring on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV are primarily affected by myeloma, headache, fever, pain and illness, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress are symptoms of delay.
Lymphenia, liver/blood function testing, and elevated creatine kinase are common SARS laboratory abnormalities.
Reduced alveolar damage, increased epithelial cells and increased microfage are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require further care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the respiratory tract, numerous organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver/blood and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, usually with cytokine cysts, which can be fatal especially in patients with weakened immune systems.
The first case of the virus was removed from an open-lung biopsy of relatives who had traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, extensive efforts have been devoted to research into HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found in young children, adults, and disabled patients with respiratory illnesses.
The presence of coronary artery disease, constipation, fever, and the lung germ is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study in the Netherlands showed an example of the isolation of the underlying virus from an 8-month-old boy with breast cancer.
Although it is known in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed internationally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of normal respiratory illnesses, and its highest incidence occurs in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with inhibitory laryngitis, also known as CROP.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was excluded from a 71-year-old man hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and pneumonia.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asmatitis.
Similar to HCoV-NL63 HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected worldwide, causing fewer respiratory diseases.
All four of these communities of HCoVs have been well-normalised in humans and are generally less likely to cause more pathogenic diseases, while incidents have been caused by unknown causes as occur in incidents of more virulent subtypes of HCoV-NL63.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and persist in humans, they become less dangerous or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in 2012 that caused acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, import cases have occasionally been reported in close second-linked countries in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak emerged in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS clinical manifestations are similar to SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop severe renal failure, which is most specific to Mers in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have stomach symptoms, such as diarrhea and inflammation.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases reported a 34.4% increase in cases, making Mers-CoV the deadliest virus known to humans.
In mid- to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients identified as being related to SARS-CoV-2 disease were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of global concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of crude/unconfirmed deaths.
Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory diseases such as CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and dyspepsia.
Some patients have also been diagnosed with complications.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can lead to severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly toxic due to the homology of a high nucleotide sequence of 82%, they are clustered in different branches of the phylactic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently a less carcinogenic disease but is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptomatic themes of infection with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal many benefits.
First, the incubation period and the incubation period of HCoVs are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general status of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is present between SARS-CoV and four socially transmitted HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show forms that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of unpredictable, moderate or even non-symptomatic symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting ways that community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs both show characteristics.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than the HCoV at least community-acquired.
On the other hand, it must be confirmed whether the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission in humans as seen in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 must be detected in fecal samples.
Although oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 ovarian plays an important role as will be clarified by future studies in at least some cases in the case of SARS-CoV.
It is particularly interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may explain the weather as well as the HCoVs received by the community are in cases.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 variant will be effective for the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 after its transmission, outbreak and continued spread to humans.
Four community-acquired HCoVs that cause symptoms of moderation have been well adapted in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have shown good adaptation to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the previous HCoV outbreak.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans. and humans that have developed severe HCoV disease have been wiped out.
To make this happen, HCoVs must reproduce in humans sufficiently to allow adaptive mutations that combat host restriction factors.
This means that the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people are infected, the more likely it is that it will become fully known to humans.
If well understood, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the human population, becoming common in immunocompromised subjects.
These viruses do not require animal stocks.
In contrast, the highly carcinogenic - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV - have not been well received in humans and their transmission in humans cannot continue.
They need to protect and disseminate in their zone reserves and seek opportunities to promote suspicious human goals. Possibly through one or more medium and advanced hosting.
SARS-CoV-2 has a form that is similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four-community acquired HCoV.
It is as transmissible as community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is much less pathogenic/pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It will be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the original animal origins of HCoVs, it would serve us well to discuss the evolution, natural reserves, intermediate and extended host definitions and characteristics of HCoVs
An animal acts as the evolutionary host of HCoV if it is related to close ancestors who share a high homology at the level of a nucleotide sequence.
The old virus is often well known and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir keeps the host HCoV stable and long-lasting.
In both cases, the host is naturally pathogenic and is the natural host of HCoV or as the parent of the virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is introduced to a new medium host before or around humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a transitional role through the virus and then plays a host role by transmitting it to humans by expanding the amount of human infection.
HCoV can carry a deadly infection if it cannot prevent its transmission in the medium host.
In contrast, HCoVs can synchronize with the intermediate host and even create long-term efficacy.
In this case, the intermediate host is hosted by a natural reserve.
Considering epidemiological data, it has been revealed that the SARS index case has a history of animal interactions.
Subsequent supervision studies have shown that pet traders have higher anti-SARS-CoV IgG levels than the general public.
Masked seeds (Pygoma larvae) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were first known to transmit SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that there were no further reports of SARS after all the blockadeers on the market were killed.
However, it has been reported that masked fish from wild or farms were largely negative for SARS-CoV without reaching pet markets, suggesting that masked adults may only host a moderate but not a natural reservoir of CoV-SARS.
Interestingly, since 80% of the animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, chances are that small-breed species may also serve as a medium-level host for increased SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be end-of-life hosts of SARS-CoV.
A nearby related CoV was discovered in the evening looking for a natural host of SARS-CoV, named SARS-related rhinovirus CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese horseshoe shoeparks.
These drivers are positive for the SARSR-RH-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence and SARS-CoV antibodies.
These and other Norshoperan CoVs share a 92-88% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that cut-mats host human-made human cortex.
Several SARS-CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in the evening, but with the exception of one virus designated as WIV1, none can be classified as a living virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as a SARS-CoV receptor or receptor.
The evening primate feces are injected into the unproduced WIV1 specimen that uses the virus as the receptor for the evening primate, fungi and humans to enter the cell ACE2.
It is noteworthy that serum or serum of SARS-CoV-1 recovered patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest-related strain of SARS-CoV in the evening apparitions, with 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Although there are many similarities between these two viruses, the general belief is that WIV1 is not the closest progenitor virus to SARS-CoV and the late-afternoon virus is not the closest protective host of SARS-CoV.
Felogenetic analysis and analysis classifies MERS-CoV into the same group as the evening exposure CoV-HKU4 and the evening exposure CoV-HKU5.
Both evening primates CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host, Diptidylpeptidiase 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
RNAThe MERS-CoV-related RNA polymers are phylogenetically close to the homologous evening-only beta-CoVs known in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been detected in wild evening fever.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity to the evening venomous virus CoV-HKU25.
So the evening monkeys may not be the closest protective host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that Arabic oats have positive effects for the specific inhibitory antibody of MERS-CoV, as do Ara oats in many African countries.
Cut-mats are not isolated from the cooked fluids of the Arabian fluid MERS-CoV, which is similar to the virus found in humans, by which the larvae are grown as the main protective hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that mild symptoms were typically seen in people infected with MERS-CoV for the experiment but the prevalence of the virus was much higher.
It is worth noting that infected ticks not only infect respiratory viruses but also feed through the mouth of the feces, which is also the main route of infection of evening lice.
However, questions remain as most confirmed cases of MERS have no history of any contact with tears before the onset of symptoms, apparently attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unknown animals that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleotide similarity to the evening venomous CoV RaTG13 isolated from the venomous venomous venomous venomous venomous venomous.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence discrepancy or distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the congenital relationship.
This means that the evening host may not be a safe host of SARS-CoV-2 unless a near-extinct virus is also detected in the future.
Presumably, the SARS-CoV-2 medium host animal should be among the wild animals that were bought and killed in the Hanan seafood wholesale market, where many early cases of COVID-19 were linked, indicating a potential outbreak of animal-to-human transmission.
A number of recent studies from the Metagenomic Series of Prebninast suggest that at-risk young animals known as honeybees (Manus Yavanka) may also have hereditary beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These genomes of the new penguin CoV have a nucleotide-linked sequence of 85-92% homologous to SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are similarly closely related to RaTG13 which has a nucleotide series similarity of nearly 90%.
Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in their biogenetic tree are grouped into two subfamilies, one of which has a receptor blending domain (RBD) very similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
Mostly differentiated, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, RBD are more differentiated, although the genome-back homologous sequence is larger.
An earlier study of infected mammals also reported the detection of a viral infection from milk, similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different methods of synthesis and manual synthesis to produce three levels of genome sequences with a synthesis of approximately 86.3% of the viral genome's full-length.
We cannot ignore the fact that the hive is one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the currently differing sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoVs related to the SARS-CoV-2 sibling, there is no evidence to directly support the origin between the SARS-CoV-2 sibling and the SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and the related beta-CoVs, the sibling SARS-CoV-2.
The pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in mammals, mammals and other animals has not yet been detected.
While a high homologous sequence has been found in RBD genes between SARS-CoV-2 and the mouse, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, have a high-level genome-specific sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 that share a common homologous sequence.
It is highly speculative that the high similarity between the sister-sister SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 RBD strains is due to the increased combination of preferential mediation.
Another proposal then supports a replication between the related beta-CoV of the SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driver of growth power, reproduction among beta-CoVs is more widespread.
Judgments about the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still far from over.
In addition, the animal origin of the highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the strain CoVs, while the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 hereditary viruses have been found in the mouse family.
A strain of CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in North American tricolor strains has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another strain of CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, found in Ghana, while there is also doubt as to whether it is an intermediate host in the owl family.
For clarification, a summary of the current available information on the origin of HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Historically, biogenetic analyses have provided evidence for evidence of animal-to-animal transmission of HCoVs.
When HCoV-OC43 came to humans from domestic animals around 1890, respiratory infections were recorded.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E among animals is less explicit.
Variety alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among these are the alpha-CoV alpaca.
A number of different pieces of evidence support evidence for transmission of viruses between mammals and humans.
First, humans may have had contact with alpacas in the environment.
However, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the strain-related alpha-CoVs are distinct from HCoV-229E and do not cause seizures in strains, while the alpha-CoVs caused respiratory infection in infected animals.
As a result, the alpha-CoV alpaca has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the lack of alpacas can be overlooked as they transmit HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans.
In fact, obesity is a direct source of human pathogens including the dog virus, Ebola virus, Naphtah virus, and Handra virus.
So it's not surprising that the virus can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while the alpha-CoVs of the strain act as a source of the HCoV-229E inheritance, alpacas and a buck-like host may be intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as demonstrated by the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV transmission from a broom to a human is a good example of animal-to-human transmission.
The origin of the strain MERS-CoV is known in the early stages of development and has been supported by recent findings.
It is clear that the breeding of hereditary and animal-specific pathogens is a rich source of viruses among animals.
Longevity, overpopulation, close social connections and strong flight ability are all supporting conditions for the virus's proper transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been transmitted to a single human eye for decades.
It is well adapted to these animals that have evolved from a moderate host to a stable and natural resource.
MERS-CoV causes a much lower incidence of disease and maintains a much lower rate of mutation in these animals.
The uncontrolled transmission to humans is an accident and humans are the end hosts of MERS-CoV because its spread cannot continue.
In contrast to tear flu in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of the mother-in-law, whatever it may be, is another variant in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, mammalian beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in mammals.
In the case of SARS-CoV to cat families, they may be a host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In future studies, the various variations of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to animals from animals to humans should be accepted or rejected.
First, the strain may be the source of a similar host to the SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
Humans may share an environmental area similar to that of the branches of butchery or screw mining.
Second, the mammals may be a growing intermediate host to whom the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been transmitted.
Humans are infected by the carnivores and the meat of prey.
Many animals, including domestic animals, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals is required for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in third-generation animals with back-synthesis and adaptation to both ruminants and mammals.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is also ongoing.
In addition to the variety of host animals, there are three important virologically important factors for the ease of transmission of CoVs to animals.
First, their high rate of change in RNA re-production is more likely.
Compared to other RNA single-stranded viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of CoVs can range from "medium" to "high", and the average rate of mutation is ~10-4 per 2 domains per year, and this depends on the stage of the new host CoV.
CoVs contain exoribonuclear correction, which results in a high degree of removal change and decrease or no continuation.
It is noteworthy that nucleotide analogue remdesweers are known to inhibit the reproduction of CoV through these exoribonucleases and RNA-based RNA polymers.
Remsweir is highly stimulating against SARS-CoV-2 agents to be evaluated annually.
However, the rate of conversion of CoVs is almost a million times higher than their host.
In addition, the conversion rate is higher when the CoVs are not well-adjusted to the host.
With higher rates of mutation than SARS-CoV, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is seen to be lower, meaning a higher rate of human habit.
It may have become accustomed to a host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also relevant to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a brown leaf.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic modification will prove ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals anytime soon.
Second, the large RNA genome mutation and re-synthesis in CoVs uses greater flexibility in genome mutation, as it increases the ability of the joint to grow between animals, when conditions are appropriate to the emergence of new CoVs.
Its support functions as a 3′ encoded open reading frame at the end of the genome and a more specific protein.
Third, CoVs alter irregular and repeated templates during RNA reproduction through a special "copy variation" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a joint vessel, a string change occurs frequently during the recording of the CoV RNA.
High-level similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs can be reconstituted to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of natural re-synthesis has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as the strain SL-CoV and the strain CoV-HKU9.
Viral-corporeal transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, transmission between animals is another important factor in the viral interaction with the host host.
Thus, SARS-CoV back synthesis has been taken as a common example, showing evidence of positive variability in animal-to-animal transmission events.
Based on comparative analyses between humans and cats of SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoVs, it is thought that the rapid acclimatization of different hosts, especially S protein, to RBD mutations is ongoing.
Typically, the S protein RBD of a CoV binds to a cellular receptor and is strongly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD in the S1 fragment is in the 318th to 510th amino acids that bind to the human ACE2 and to the host to enter the virus.
SARS-CoV, RBD can detect ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including cats, mice, and dogs, allowing the virus to spread among animals.
In fact, only 6 amino acids in RBD have been observed to be resistant to human and wildcat variation and 4 of them are located in the receptor-binding pattern for binding to the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of a cat has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the appetite for spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, mutations in both of these amino acids may be important for humans to get used to the virus.
It is safe to say that SARS-CoV-2 has a common cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein suggests that the human's tendency to bind S protein to ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, a study of cryo-EM showed a high rate of attachment of 10-20%, as opposed to between the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to know if any of the recipients of the companion may be necessary for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but to the S-type.
There are several HCoV receptors, such as amino peptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylsalicylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
Once they have spread from their host to animals, they may also be considered for successful adaptation of these CoVs.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of the spread of HCoVs among animals is also governed by the need for another host and constraint factors.
The differences in these host proteins between humans and natural resource hosts of HCoVs such as bats, brown-footed ferrets, mice and other animals can be a barrier to transmission among animals.
For HCoVs to spread successfully among animals, they must go beyond the host need factors and eliminate the host restriction factors.
Therefore, molecular factors in this important area of viral-corporeal interaction still need to be identified and explained.
The use of advanced CRISPR technology may be useful for genome-specific seamless testing for host need and barrier factors for SARS-CoV-2.
New HCoVs emerging: Back to the origin
Multiple variants of the strain of CoVs provide more opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
Therefore, the HCoVs of the genome are the source of the HCoVs gene pool.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic reintegration also contribute to the development of HCoV and serve as two important steps in that sequence.
For example, gaining or losing new protein-coding genes is capable of drastically changing the viral genotype.
Among SARS-CoV-associated proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-associated strain viruses have been isolated but have been found to encode different ORF8 proteins.
The presence of a 29-nucleotide that is characteristic of SARS-CoVs is found in viruses that are known to be the origin of human infections.
This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a normal change in the inducement of a host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible backward synthesis history with alpha and gamma-CoVs, where RNA-binding RNA polymers have been found to be backward-synthesized.
Backward synthesis positions are also known in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic has experienced a back-synthesis among different families, occurring in the wake of a Saudi Arabian book.
In addition, cases of backflow of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs re-fuse with other animal CoVs in their non-natural structure genes.
It should also be noted that artificial variants may involuntarily contribute to the mutation of viral genomes, largely resulting from selectively induced strains, such as the release of viruses by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in HCoV-229E, due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While full ORF4 can be found in the viruses of mosquitoes and mosquitoes related to HCoV-229E, the inclusion of alpaca alpha-CoV shows an individual nucleotide, resulting in mutation.
As a result, the growth of new HCoVs is also driven by variation pressures in their host stock.
Symptomless disease or only mild symptomatic disease is detected when a mosquito is infected with CoVs, indicating a common habit between CoVs and mosquitoes.
The ants seem to be automatically and physiologically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, disorders in the function of the parasitic response in plants actively reduce pathogen activation by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in fungi is inhibited by the upper activity of the natural killer cell activator NKG2/CD94 and lower-level homogeneity I-grade molecules.
In addition, high-response oxygen species (ROS) produced by the branches due to their high metabolic activity can both prevent the re-production of CoV and the corrective effects by exoribonucleosis, as when a more pathogenic virus is transferred to a new host it provides circulatory pressure for production.
More pathogenic CoV viruses can mutate with re-synthesis, and take new forms of proteins or proteins to adapt to the host.
So, it is unlikely that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic in their host host host such as mosquitoes and moths or cause a rare disease.
They reproduce quickly without the host security system showing a strong response.
So there is a mystery as to why there are untreated patients and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are primarily due to high levels of immune response and cytokine stunting, meaning that the stronger the immune response, the greater the lung damage.
In other words, the immune response in symptomless patients is isolated from the reproduction of CoV.
Similar isolation strategies for immune response can have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The interferon response in the wing is particularly strong.
Therefore, administering type I interferon at an early stage of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.
In addition, the NLRP3 inflammasome activation disorder in the kidneys.
With this argument, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibitors with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general perception that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a strain of beta-CoV has been found to share a 95% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV, there is also a strain of bat-CoV that shares a 96% nucleotide structure with SARS-CoV-2.
While cats and other animals have been found in markets with viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the approximate mediator host for SARS-CoV-2 is not known.
It has been found that honeybees beta-CoVs are more similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that honeybees may be as intermediate hosts or honeybees beta-CoVs may be involved with gene fragments in the SARS-CoV-2 outcome example.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
CoVs have once again become common due to the recent onset of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of CoVs in mammals and other animals have greatly changed our understanding of the transmission of HCoVs to humans and the importance of deposits and animal origin in animals.
General evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the primary pathogenic strains and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that the SARS-CoV virus originated in the interaction between humans and cats in markets, closing milk markets and killing cats could have effectively eradicated the SARS outbreak.
Based on the same argument, beekeepers should have milk markets to prevent animal transmission, as beekeeper beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and a number of associations have been found.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans from mammals or other animals will need to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in a bookworm for a long time.
These oils serve as a central source of transportation as well as meat, milk, leather and dairy products for the local people.
They are widely available in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all eggs for the control of MERS, as was done in Chinese open markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the re-spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach must be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV alongside other measures to control the spread of MERS to humans.
Since we cannot eliminate viruses, new genotypes can emerge and cause spread.
There are many types of CoVs in wildlife.
Specifically, the species of the genus CoVs have a higher potential than the animal.
There are many opportunities for these animal CoVs to mutate and recombine, resulting in new CoVs that are more likely to spread and/or be fatal in humans in the future.
In some parts of China, the culture of wild animal feeding must be avoided to reduce the need for a link between humans and animals.
A plan for preparation and response to the problems of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 should be developed.
In fact, there have been many viruses in the world for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although reptiles have many forms that contribute to the spread of viruses, the chances of human interaction with reptiles and other wildlife can be reduced if people are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous animal monitoring is needed to raise awareness of the environment of CoVs and the natural environment of corpuscles, which will prove useful in preventing future spread from animal to human.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent animal viruses from occurring in humans is to remove them from the natural environment of animal viruses.
Several fragments of the mystery of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if a mosquito spreads the hereditary SARS-CoV-2 to mammals, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances mosquitoes and mammals can share the same environmental area.
Second, if the parasite directly contributes to the spread to humans, it must be known how humans interact with the parasite.
Third, if a third animal acts as the main intermediate host, how it interacts with different animals including humans, reptiles and mammals should be clarified.
As a result, since many animals, including domestic animals, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental transmission should be carried out.
Whether it is a reptile, mammal or other animal, SARS-CoV-2 or its closely related hereditary viruses are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will clarify the ways in which SARS-CoV-2 spreads in animals, which will be important in the prevention and control outcomes of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of the COVID-19 diagnostic standard data for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" is required
On February 6, 2020, our 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment, and these guidelines have provided our experience and provide better information to combat this common pandemic worldwide.
However, as 2019 (COVID-19) is a new coronavirus pandemic, our awareness and knowledge is increasing steadily in light of ongoing research findings and annual work experience; as diagnostic and diagnostic strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter we asked a question about our guidelines and proposed a new diagnostic standard for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", a reference to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (the second version), published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, currently officially named Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named after the severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a public pandemic.
To combat the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, our team has developed a quick consultation guide and on 06 February 2020 it was published online in Military Medical Research.
It has attracted much attention since its publication.
But remember that COVID-19 is a new disease, in proportion to ongoing research findings and annual work experience our awareness and knowledge are constantly increasing; as diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), as of 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven versions with some parts substantially changed.
Now that our guides have gotten an idea from Zhou et al., they suggested scoring based on their annual experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guide and is valuable information for this common pandemic.
We acknowledge and express our gratitude for their hard work.
However, their work data should also be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines and recent studies for COVID-19 (Test Seven).
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), for the confirmation of a suspected case, a epidemiological diagnosis history must be combined with two materials of annual evidence to form an all-encompassing analysis, or three materials of annual evidence must be met if no epidemiological diagnosis history is apparently available.
Diagnostic history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or the Wuhan community where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of the disease; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks (with a positive test for nucleic acid); (3) history of contact with patients in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or the Wuhan community where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of the disease; (4) history of contact with patients with confirmed cases such as ≥ 2 cases/s in a given day in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or the Wuhan community where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of the disease; and (2) history of contact with patients with a history of infection or respiratory illness; (4) history of confirmed cases in the given area such as a group of cases with a minor/s in the home, school, office, and other areas of the city.
Annual symptoms: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) visual exposure to COVID-19; (3) normal, decreased, or decreased white blood cell count in the early stages of onset.
Confirmed case diagnosis should be based on a suspected case with pathogenic or serological evidence of one of the following substances: (1) a real-time positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a viral whole genome sequencing that shows high similarity to the new coronavirus; (3) a serum test for a specific IgM antibody and a positive for IgM antibody for SARS-CoV-2; or SARS-CoV-2 from a negative to a positive for a specific IgM antibody, or a substance ≥4 increases in the course of recovery to what is in the severe course.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples has been added in the second (18 January) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
Pathogenic identification of vein samples was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added in the eight editions.
These changes are the result of ongoing work by researchers to investigate how to detect high levels of nucleic acid for rapid diagnosis, and to take blood samples from the respiratory tract, i.e., adding different samples, and supporting the delivery of specific positive results on a validated standard.
In addition, there is additional evidence that we should treat patients with normal symptoms and those without symptoms with caution.
Therefore, the work map data of Zhou et al. should be updated, as those without an annual index were classified as "at low risk".
The scoring system must also be validated in other annual works and studies.
As a result, we look forward to more detailed evidence coming in and asking readers to comment.
To diagnose "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that we follow and comply with our countries' new guidelines.
Our team has updated its guidance in time to offer help.
Bangladesh has reported five more deaths from Covid-19, the highest number of deaths per day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed the deaths of five more people due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
The Bangladesh Epidemic Disease Control and Research Agency (IEDCR) released a report on the number of people affected by the coronavirus yesterday, including 114 people who are still infected, and 33 cases who have not recovered from the disease and remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjad Saabrine Flora said that four men and one woman were among the dead.
Dr Meerjady said that two of the dead were over sixty, two were 51 to 60 and one was 41 to 50.
It also said that two of the victims were residents of Dhaka.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
Hospital officials told the news agency that one of the dead was Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission Chairman Jalaj Saif Rahman, who was in Kuwait Metro Hospital.
In an online video on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Land Roads and Bridges, Abidal-Qadir, said public transport would be shut down for longer than planned.
The first public transportation was closed on 2 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
But transportation of essential items such as medicine, fuel and food was still open.
The Covid-19 outbreak in Bangladesh came to a head on March 8, which included two people who had returned from Italy and a patient's wife.
The three were later recovered on March 19.
The number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has surpassed one million.
Johns Hopkins University data on Thursday showed that more than one million cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak have been reported worldwide.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The goal came on the day Malawi's first coronavirus outbreak and Zambia's first coronavirus deaths were recorded.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries free of coronavirus infection.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases that occurred before 10 a.m. central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4th.
In the United States, there have been no more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, including at least 5,900 deaths.
According to CBS News, based on data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 people died of the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday in the United States.
Worldwide, many countries have taken tough steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin extended the quarantine period until May 1.
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said that Russians will be paid indoors by April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted in favour of extending the state of emergency for another 15 days; 215 votes were in favour and one against the state of emergency.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina to last until the end of the day; previously, the curfew was from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike D. Vine has announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order to May 1.
Shops in Australia have lowered the threshold for toilet paper
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian retail chain Wolverty & Coles reduced restrictions on the sale of toilet paper, which is two or one pack at a time in all stores nationwide.
ALDI also on Monday, introduced a single-bedroom limit.
The limits were posted in the form of news messages at exit points and on the chain's Facebook page.
The report said that buyers were afraid of being quarantined due to COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Wolverhampton also lowered the purchase limit for toilet paper to one bed.
These changes came after the four-seat shot put was introduced by Woolworth and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in a media report on March 8 that, in line with the four-bedroom limit, "most stores sell their items within an hour of arrival" and called the order "unusual", while Aldi called the Facebook post "unusual" on Tuesday.
A Wolverhampton spokesman said sales had "surged" last week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the allowable quantity to two last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles asked suppliers for more large bags and supplies, Wolverhampton ordered extra stock, and Aldi provided stock for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but this was hampered by local council's timely closure of trucks.
He expects higher production prices, as suppliers try to meet demand and what's special.
On Tuesday, Alda announced that after the stock expires, some stores will not be able to operate a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer of Queensland University of Technology says stores are meeting daily deadlines.
He noted that toilet paper is a large item, and in small quantities, and when purchased, spaces in large cabinets can be emptied, giving a sense of understock.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Close and Wolverthes had an idea that if there were more items in the closets, and more items like toilets and sanitizers, they could be less risky.
The owner of the recycled toilet paper said last Wednesday that the storage was ending with the two.
Kimberly-Clark, a clinic tissue and solaris paper surfactant manufacturer, quoted News.com as saying they both worked 24/7 to restore supplies.
Real Estate Site Domain.com reported that property workers in Melbourne have offered away the first bidder's tickets at auction, with a series of auctions due to Labour's time constraints.
The eighth edition of Darwin's Sunday News was printed on toilet paper.
The Australian BBC reported on March 3 that the store owners were not in favor of the restrictions, and there were no plans to impose a ban on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other items is also high, including masks, sanitizers, dry cleaning, hand washes and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, Sunday's Bundy British online supermarket Andrew Tilt Paper observed a purchase of 12Rollers.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
World Health Organization on Wednesday announced an outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
If the epidemic is at its highest level, not the number of dangerous cases, the World Health Organization has ordered governments to take action.
All countries can still change the duration of the epidemic.
WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Chhibrisos said that if countries responded, they would detect, test, treat, isolate and train their people.
Many of us are very concerned about the spread of the disease at a dangerous rate and the seriousness of its response.
Former U.S. disease control and prevention director Dr. Tom Friedan called the epidemic "unusual".
He said in a February analysis published by CNN that the virus, other than influenza, had spread globally.
Gibresos also said that the Mongs had never faced an outbreak like the coronavirus.
He said, "Mong has not seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time".
With the new pandemic situation, the World Health Organization decided in January that the pandemic would declare a global public health emergency.
The president of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said the pandemic will be worse off at a lower rate.
The Associated Press reported in a report on Thursday that 4,600 deaths were reported among the more than 1,600 people infected with the coronavirus.
The 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak is a continuation of the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which is the progressive spread of severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The pandemic was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and a national health emergency was declared in the country in late December due to global concerns, and the date of March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic again.
As of 10 April 2020, there were 1.60 million cases of coronavirus reported in 210 countries, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
A further 364,000 people have recovered from the disease.
The mortality rate was recorded at 4% in China, and 13.04% worldwide, followed by 0.08% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
General ailments include fever, dry cough, and fatigue.
A severe and complex condition is a breast, a respiratory system obstruction, and a failure of many organs resulting in weakness or death.
The symptoms usually appear within five days of onset but in some cases take two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the new coronavirus.
The first treatment is to help the patient and help him, suggested precautions are important, such as washing hands, holding a cough, keeping distance, and avoiding suspects.
Internationally, authorities are implementing laws such as travel restrictions, quarantine, tourism restrictions, and workplace risk control.
The pandemic has caused severe economic unrest worldwide, with a dramatic decline in the movement of sports, religious, political and cultural events and the fear of buying.
Universities and schools in all 193 countries have been closed on a national or local basis, affecting about 99.4% of students worldwide.
Online misinformation about the virus was shared, and there has been an outbreak of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, including people of East and South East Asian descent, and areas where the virus is not being treated.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased due to reduced transportation and the closure of large factories.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia was reported in an unidentified weather event in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Most of the cases are related to Havana's seafood and the virus is said to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that transmits the pandemic, known as SARS-CoV, is a newly discovered virus that shares close similarities with the coronavirus, the coronavirus, and SARS-CoV, the first person to be infected on 1 December 2019 was not associated with this white-closed market.
Two-thirds of the first reported cases in December 2019 were identified as market-related.
An unconfirmed report in the South China Morning Post newspaper on 13 March 2020 said that cases were detected in 55 provinces in Habei on 17 November 2019, with a decline in outbreaks in the WHO and China on 26 February 2020, but a gradual increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
Cases may be reported sparingly, especially in cases with minor outbreaks.
On 26 February, fewer cases were reported in young people, of whom 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of the world's population, estimated UK science adviser Patrick Vallance that 60% of the UK population should be immunized before the outbreak.
The number of cases refers to people who have been tested for COVID-19.
No country had tested 3% of its population by March 23, with more countries not testing low-risk vaccines, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, following their policies.
According to a study published on March 16, up to a certain 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected as of January 23, and the non-communicable infection was the source of 79% of cases.
According to its statistical analysis published on March 30, the number of coronavirus cases in Italy is much higher than reported.
The primary production number before the COVID-19 primary dose is from RO (1.40) to 2.4
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests it may be 5.7.
More and more people are recovering from COVID-19.
The practice of dying to recover is not 6 to 41 days, and for the most common people it is 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 billion deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, 80% of deaths by 5 February were in people over the age of 60, and 75% had previous heart disease and diabetes, generally giving the official COVID-19 deaths a protocol for testing positive.
It is possible that the number of deaths from COVID-19 will actually be higher, as this will not include those who have died without being tested, for example in homes or nursing homes and other places.
Early data from Italy shows that the number of deaths from COVID-19 is 5x-4 higher than official deaths.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has acknowledged that the number of deaths has declined, with the latest report showing that fewer cases have been confirmed in the U.S. This is the case in outbreaks such as the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu outbreak. The first confirmed death in Wuhan was on January 9, 2020.
The first deaths outside Mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
28 Feb Outside China, dozens of deaths have been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories and every continent except Antarctica reported deaths, with more general measures taken to measure deaths.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of trials, quality of health care, treatment options, time after the first case and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health, with the ratio of death to death reflecting the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University figures, the worldwide mortality rate as of April 10, 2020, is 6.0%.
These numbers vary by region.
The mortality rate in China has been reduced from 17.3% of those with symptoms 1 through 10 January 2020 to 0.7% of those with symptoms 1 through February 2020.Next steps include the incidence mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those who die from the disease, and the incidence rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of those who die from the disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
The emotion has no time limit and specific populations are the aftermath of infection to resolution.
Several scientific institutions have attempted to use this data for specific populations.
The Oxford University Medical Center has measured the prevalence of the outbreak from 0.1% to 0.39 percent based on medical evidence.
The highest rates of this range in Germany are consistently diagnosed with COVID-19, and a statistical study measures the effectiveness of the diagnosis in CFR.
The World Health Organization has stated that the epidemic can be controlled.
The frequency and timing of the disease is variable and the location varies accordingly.
Penn State University's Maciej Boni says that an uncontrolled infection typically begins to flare up and then decline when the infection spreads from an existing host.
But it is not possible to make any kind of smart prediction now about when it will happen.
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nashan argues that it will be over by June, if all countries follow the World Health Organization's recommendations to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Typical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 could potentially spread for a year or two.
Neil Ferguson of Imperial College said that these would have required distance and other precautions "until vaccines were available (in the next 18 months or more)".
William Shaffer of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's possible that the coronavirus - because it's easily forgotten - will disappear completely and it's possible" to turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year.
The virus's return will depend on the extent of immunity and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively undetectable and patients can be treated with no symptoms.
Two common symptoms are fever, 88% and dry spells, 68%.
Few common symptoms include fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, chest pain, headache, cancer, cancer, cancers, hemorrhoids, spina bifida, or sciatica. The World Health Organization says that one in six people get sick and have difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has compiled a list of emergencies that include respiratory problems, chest pain or stress, sudden confusion, problems with standing up and facial or shoulder discomfort. Immediate medical attention is recommended for those with these symptoms.
These patients will have no symptoms or medical symptoms, but the diagnosis will show the disease, the researchers advise that those who have been with the patients recently should be monitored and investigated to eliminate the infection.
China has a 44% uncommon rate of infection.
There are 14 days between the infection and the infection, more than 5 days, with the unusual situation being that the sensitivity of COVID-19 patients is 30 percent and the incidence is 15 percent.
Some explanations of how the disease spread are still being determined.
The first is in close contact with humans, and is transmitted by contact with airborne droplets, parasites or close individuals 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft) away.
The findings show that coughing in the open air can spread the virus from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 ft (27 ft).
Some people suggest that the virus can also spread in the form of tiny droplets in the air because it stays in the air for long hours, which does not leave during breathing, breathing droplets are also found during breathing but when it is spoken, the solvent virus is not found in the air.
The drops can be placed in the mouth or nose of nearby people or may be taken to the breast.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) also aerosolize respiratory moisture and release it into the air.
The virus can also spread by touching the eyes, nose, and mouth when exposed to contaminated surfaces, including skin.
There is also concern that the disease may spread through waste materials but the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 has been contaminated. The virus is more prevalent in the last three days after the onset of symptoms, although there is a possibility that it will spread before the onset of symptoms and the end of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease three days before the onset of the epidemic that there is a possibility of transmission before significant symptoms develop.
There are only asymptomatic case reports confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during the investigation of contact finding.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detected in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on a board card for a day, and in copper for up to four hours.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, such as with other surfaces that may have been contacted by the disease.
Severe and delicate respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that was first isolated from three patients with severe respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All strains of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the corresponding coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by a family soap, which dissolves its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS.
It is said that the virus is transmitted from animals.
Genetic analysis reveals that the coronavirus clusters genetically two double-clutch strains together in the subgenus Sarbic virus (RB) with the beta coronavirus genus.
It is 96% the same overall genome level as other strain-infected coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between penguins and viruses from humans in some parts of the genome chain.
A relatively 92% of the total genome comparison to date has found genetic material shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove pangolin to be an intermediate host.
Infections by a virus can be diagnosed briefly based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately compensated by a polymerase chain reaction of infected products or CT images.
A study comparing PCR to PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, many of its reactions were overshadowed by other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CTs should not be used for first-line testing or screening to diagnose COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first published on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on breathing or blood samples.
Results are typically available for several hours to days.
Typically this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal swab while a column swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies run serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
The serological test developed by SILEX in the United States has only been approved by accredited laboratories for emergency use.
Imaging characteristics in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) that are symptomatic include disproportionate peripheral grade apses and an absent optical factor
The Italian Association of Radiologists maintains an international online database of reaction findings for confirmed cases.
Due to the increase in other infections such as the adenovirus, taking a picture without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT results to PCR and revealed that although the reaction is less specific to infection, but faster and more sensitive, it suggests its importance as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Strong artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect viral interactions with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, preventing hands from leaving with hands, nose and mouth, and coughing or sneezing and placing tissue directly in a waste container.
Those who may already have the infection are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Measures to keep physical distance have also been proposed to prevent transmission. Many governments restrict or advise all non-essential travel to countries and territories affected by growth.
However, the virus has reached a point of spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they have contracted the disease. Healthcare providers care for those who may use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact stabilization is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have been raised with governments using location data from mobile phones to this end, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have called for such surveillance restrictions in a statement.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or offered for bidding use, and as of April 2020 experts groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to get closer to the user with other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have a close relationship with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misconceptions are spread about how to prevent the disease. For example, cleaning the nose and mouthwashing are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people bathe frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are obviously dirty; before eating; and after bathing a cough or a cough.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by the family soap, which breaks its protective bubble.
The CDC further recommended using alcohol-based hand sanitizer at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The World Health Organization tells people not to touch their eyes, nose or chest until they wash their hands.
The face can be disinfected with a number of solutions (facing the stainless steel face with a virus cleaner for at least one minute) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen on oxide and 0.2-7.5% powydone iodine.
Other solvents such as benzalconum chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective.
CDC states that any office or other location where there is a suspected or suspected coronavirus outbreak, all rooms, restrooms, meeting places, common electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, typewriters, remote controls and ATMs that are in use should be disinfected.
Health organizations often use a mouth and nose to collect the edges or hide the hair when itching or itching and then treat the hair immediately.
Surgical surgery may be recommended for individuals who are infected with the virus, but surgery may reduce the concentration of their non-excretionary respiratory droplets and their ability to travel during coughing, pain or talking.
The World Health Organization recommends when and how to benefit from masks.
According to University of Leeds virologist Stephen Graf, wearing a mask can reduce people's facial contact, but not washing their hands properly is the most common cause of skin cancer. Masks can also be recommended for those who care for and care for sick people.
The World Health Organization recommends wearing masks to people who are at high risk, such as those who care for people who are not affected by COVID-19, and they also recognize that wearing masks can prevent them from touching their face.
Many countries have launched a campaign to encourage people to wear masks in public places.
In the United States, the CDC advises the use of non-toothed facial surfaces; China specifically advises healthy individuals to use non-toothed medical surfaces and then when they are approached by others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended surgical evacuation in case of travel or overcrowding on public transport.
Thai health authorities are encouraging the public to wear face masks at home and then wash daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from leaving without a visa or hiding their mouths.
On 16 March, Vietnam urged all citizens to call for facial expressions when leaving to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has forced everyone to enter the store, so it is necessary to face the opposition.
Israel has urged all citizens to use face masks outside the country.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million buses a day since mid-March, has imposed a curfew on passengers on Hurghada and city-to-city buses on April 1.
Panama has assumed that face masks will be required when leaving and advised that people who cannot afford to buy masks prepare masks themselves at home.
Face masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Distance-keeping (also called physical distancing) involves the practice of gas-controlled procedures to curb the spread of disease by reducing the proximity between tissues.
The measures include self-exclusion, travel restrictions and closures of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, exhibitions and markets.
Individuals should practice their habits by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding fights, not mixing up in greetings at the same time, and staying away from others.
Many governments force or advise isolation in areas that have not been affected by the disease.
The number of people affected by the U.S. government and health agencies increased from 250 (if there is no COVID-19 outbreak in the area) to 50 and then 10 immediately.
On March 22, Germany imposed a ban on gatherings of no more than two people, with older adults and those who are being treated for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a weakened immune system at increased risk of severe illness, as CDC advised to stay at home more in the epidemic zone. In March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began changing the term "social distancing" to "physical distancing", which would indicate goals to reduce physical contact with others, if they were punished or if they were away.
The term "social distancing" has been incorporated to mean continually empowering people to social isolation, not encouraging others to communicate with each other in a manner that some authorities have guided for sexual health during the pandemic.
The specific recommendations here are that a person who has sex with someone with whom they live, who does not have or have symptoms of the virus.
Special isolation at home is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are also infected.
Health agencies should provide detailed guidance for appropriate specific isolation. More governments mandate or recommend self-quarantine in the affected area.
Stricter self-quarantine guidelines have been adopted for more vulnerable groups.
Those who have been exposed to people not infected with COVID-19 and those who have traveled to a country or region where the virus is prevalent in recent days have also been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days.
Elimination or prevention and reduction in the level of outbreak are included in the outbreak control policy.
Virus control is done in the early stages of the outbreak to diagnose and distinguish those infected with the virus from others, and to determine the level of disease control and vaccination to prevent other people from infecting.
When disease control becomes impossible, efforts are made to reduce the spread of disease: measures are taken to reduce the spread and limit the impact of the disease on society and the health system.
It is also possible that both the limitation and reduction phases of the disease can be combined.
Elimination requires more serious measures to reduce epidemics with a prevalence base number of less than 1. One aspect of the management of an outbreak of a pandemic is to try to reduce the spread of the epidemic, known as the outbreak graph.
It reduces the risk level for health services that have been lost and provides additional time for further therapeutic services and vaccine development.
Medicinal measures that can control the spread of the virus include individual protective measures such as: hand washing, wearing masks, and self-quarantine; and social measures that include social distancing such as: closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; and community-led acceptance of these restrictions and public participation and encouragement in these measures; as well as sanitary measures such as surface cleaning. When the severity of the outbreak was not revealed, China implemented all the strict measures to limit the spread of the virus such as: imposing strict restrictions on complete urban quarantine and travel.
Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has asked all its citizens and implemented a preventive quarantine and issued serious warnings for the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those contaminated who had self-quarantine and fined those who had not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned healthcare contractors. The similarities between the UK and the US show that there are significant challenges in reducing the virus (reducing the surface of transmission rather than preventing it) and eradicating the virus (preventing the spread of the epidemic).
A virus mitigation policy may reduce the demand for healthcare services by 2/3 and deaths by half, but it could still kill hundreds of thousands and disrupt health services.
Elimination of the virus may be preferable but should continue as long as the virus is in the public domain (and if a vaccine is already made, this phase should continue for as long as possible), but if measures are stopped, the virus will return soon.
Long-term restrictions on eradicating the virus cause social and economic damage.
There is no specific antiviral drug for COVID-19, but development efforts are still underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking medications for the fever, drinking fluids, and resting may help reduce symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the use of artificial oxygen, serum, and respiratory strength are required for the patient's well-being.
Steroid use can cause worse results.
Many compounds that were used for other viral diseases have also been tested for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization says that some "dose and family treatments" may provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has described capacity building and healthcare measures for COVID-19 patients.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization's Regional Office in Europe have issued guidelines for the delivery of resources to hospitals, primary health services, at various levels, including increasing focus on COVID-19 diagnostics in laboratories.
Many theories are also possible to produce (called zero disease).
The first positive case of coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019, in the Chinese city of Wuhan, in the center of the country.
In a month in Hubei, the number of cases of coronavirus increased gradually.
The more cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sells live animals, and a theory emerges that the virus came from animals, in other words, the zoonotic origin, an unknown pneumonia cluster that appeared on December 26 and was reported to WHO.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital issued a SARS-like coronavirus warning to their colleagues.
Eight doctors, including Lee Wen-Liang, have disgraced the same police advisers and other AI leaders for spreading false rumors.
The Wuhan Municipal Hospital Commission issued a public statement and issued a World Health Organization statement on December 31.
In January, a full investigation into an unidentified pneumonia case in Wuhan reported to health authorities that, in the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases dropped to one in seven and a half days.
In early to mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, including Wuhan, the Chinese New Year's Migration Transportation hub and the assistant railway exchange site.
On January 20, China reported 140 cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shandong Province.
Official data showed that 6,147 people had symptoms as of 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States and China outnumbered the world in the number of unregistered cases, more than 1.61 million cases were reported globally on 9 April 2020, more than 97,000 people died and more than 36,400 recovered.
There has been at least one incident in about 200 countries and regions.
The pandemic in Europe has left many countries in the Schengen area free and controls on their bridges have been tightened.
Nationally, including removal measures (such as house arrest orders, residency orders or lockdowns) and tourism, on April 2, about 300 million people, or 90% of the population, were in some form of lockdown in the United States, 50 million people were in a PO lockdown in the Philippines, about 59% million people in South Africa and 1.3 million people in India were in a lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of sanctions, which two days later increased to 2.6 billion people - a third of the world's population.
The first known case of coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, China.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia was reported in an unidentified weather event in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 27 December 2019, the first genetic tests of patients confirmed the presence of coronavirus as a SARS virus.
The Wuhan Municipal Hospital Commission issued a public statement and issued a World Health Organization statement on December 31.
The World Health Organization was informed about the same.
When the reports were made, Wuhan police warned doctors about the spread of the outbreak.
Initially, China's National Health Commission claimed that there was no clear evidence that the virus was transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a major campaign that was later renamed the People's War by Xi Jinping, the general leader of the Communist Party of China, involving the spread of the virus.
The Wuhan quarantine, the largest quarantine in human history, was imposed on 23 January by a health service belt that blocked all travel to Wuhan, then extended the quarantine to 15 other cities in the Hubei region, affecting about 57 million people.
The use of private carriages was also banned in the city.
In most places, Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hussain Shan Hospital, which was built in ten days.
A second hospital was built after that called Li Shan Shan to care for additional patients.
In addition to building new hospitals, China converted 14 other service locations in Wuhan into temporary hospitals such as: Association Centers and Stadiums. On January 26, the Chinese government also took some other measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak such as: health alerts for travelers and extending spring break.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions implemented a number of measures specifically for schools and universities.
Remote working measures were also implemented in many regions of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed on entering and traveling to the Hobi region.
Public transportation was restricted and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public transportation in most cities was controlled, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (over half the total population) were subject to evacuation restrictions. After the outbreak reached an international level in March, Chinese authorities implemented tanks and severe measures to prevent the virus from entering China from other countries.
For example, Beijing implemented a 14-month quarantine for all international travelers. On March 3, only one person was transferred across China in the last five days who had returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 3, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qianlong said the spread of the virus from foreign countries into China had stopped and the outbreak was under control in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions across the Hubei region from Wuhan were lifted after a two-month ban. On March 26, 2020, China's foreign minister announced that visa and residence applications would be postponed from March 28, but did not share specific details about the end of the policy.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for a visa through their embassies or consulates in their countries.
The Chinese government encouraged all businesses and businesses to resume operations on March 30, and helped companies through monetary settlements. The Chinese State Council set a date for April 4 for national mourning to begin at 10 a.m. with a three-minute silence, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online by maintaining physical distance due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Iranian Ministry of Health announced a Friday prayer ban in places affected by the outbreak, and subsequent shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia also banned foreign pilgrims and its people from traveling to the holy areas of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic, which began after World War II, has caused the biggest delays in the world of sports.
Many major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed such as: 20-2019 UEFA Champions League, 20-2019 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 20-2019 NBA season, and 20-2019 NHL season.
The pandemic has hampered the planning of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to take place at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced that the tournament will be held later than the scheduled dates but will not be postponed from the summer of 2021.
This has led to more gamblers gambling online, with many online gambling sites announcing an increase in the number of new people entering their sites. Gaming and entertainment industries have also been affected and many music groups have postponed or canceled their concerts.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have postponed their shows and performances.
Some artists have found alternative ways to share their works and performances with people via the Internet, instead of performing live, such as: live online concerts and organizing ceremonies through sites so that artists can refresh their performances and works and deliver them to the public.
Online, numerous online posts about the coronavirus topic have been circulated among the public in the form of satire and humor due to dissatisfaction.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a growing prejudice, xenophobia and racism against ethnic minorities in China and East Asia and people of ethnic origin in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been incidents of fear, misunderstanding and hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases of the virus were recorded in China) showed that many people around the world feel a sense of intense racial hatred and Chinese people consider the virus a cause and whatever happens to them, it is the right punishment for their actions.
Anti-China sentiment has also been seen in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their local origin.
Support for Chinese and areas with the virus is available both online and offline.
As the outbreak progresses in some new countries, the people of Italy may also face fear and stigma, the country being the first European country to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19. People from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have made efforts to contain the disease and have appealed to countries to ban Chinese entry.
In Japan, a hashtag was created on Twitter under the name #Chinese-to-Japan-No-Go.
Chinese and people from other Asian countries in Britain and the United States reported rising levels of racial discrimination and harassment against them.
US President Donald Trump has been met with reactions over his speech that dubbed the coronavirus the Chinese virus, which critics have called discriminatory and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Indian students reported their distress over the coronavirus outbreak coming to the major cities from the northeastern regions of India, bordering China, to teach.
The Bharatiya Janata Party chief minister in West Bengal's Delip said the Chinese had destroyed nature so God took a shout out at them.
Yadhana was later denounced by the Chinese Council in Calcutta and called the speech a mistake. In China, the epidemic has seen the violence and discrimination against non-Chinese citizens intensify and Chinese people refer to foreigners as foreign occupants and want to leave China.
Many newspapers have removed them from some or all of their covers.
Many scientific publications have published scientific papers on the epidemic and are accessible to anyone.
Some researchers wanted to share their findings through pre-operated servers like bioRxiv.

There are methods in laboratories for testing the respiratory virus of 2019 coronavirus 19-COVID and the existing virus of 2-SARS-CoV that detect the presence of the virus and demonstrate the production of antibodies of the organism against the virus.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
In March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus main protein was identified as a target for post-infection medicine.
It is used to diagnose the newest and most active pollutants.
Antibodies (cerology) can be detected that can be used for both diagnosis and population meditation.
Antibody tests showed how many people had the disease, both those with very few symptoms and those with symptoms that were apparent.
The exact mortality rate and public safety can be determined by the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had accurate data on the spread of the virus among its people as of March 2020.
By March 23, a country had tested less than 3% of its population, with more countries not testing less-than-significant bacteria, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, following a policy.
This diversity also affects the reported mortality rate at a higher scale that may be higher estimated in some countries.
The test uses real-time reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are typically available for several hours to days.
An RT-PCR test performed on column samples is valid only in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the chest and enter the lungs.
For those infected who are tested in the second week, alternative samples are taken from their deep respiratory tract using a stretcher tube or a cough suppressant (sputum).
One of the earliest PCR tests was conducted in Berlin in January 2020 in Charity in which a series of reverse-polymer interactions (rRT-PCR) of real-time explanatory analysis was used and provided the World Health Organization with a distribution basis of 250,000 thermal thermometers.
On January 28, 2020, a company in South Korea called Kochenbioch developed an annual temperature-scale device based on PCR and SARS-CoV-2.
It searches for E genes and specific SARS-CoV-2 released by the beta coronavirus.BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to obtain a license from the National Health Products Administration of China to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 temperature diagnostic tool. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) chronologically accurate diagnostic tools (RTPCR) to its public health laboratories through international referral sources.
One in three genetic tests of older test kits resulted in inappropriate results due to poor performance and a test barrier at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to only 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, two tests conducted in the state were not considered satisfactory, and these tests were not accepted to allow testing by state and local laboratories.
These tests were approved by the Food and Drug Administration via an emergency use permit. U.S. commercial laboratories began their tests in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests are now conveniently accessible from RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostic also made available access to COVID-19 testing nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were announced, and sampling and processing must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
COVID-19 tests in Russia were prepared and launched by the State Research Centre for Viral Identification and Victorian Biotechnology.
The test was registered by the Federal Health Care Administration on February 11, 2020. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic announced a COVID-19 diagnostic test. On March 13, 2020, Roach Diagnostic Company received FDA approval for a test that will be performed on a large scale in three and a half hours, with approximately 4,128 tests being performed on a single machine in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA authorized Abbott Laboratories to use the Abbott m2000 test for emergency use; similar licenses were also granted by the FDA to some laboratories such as: Halologic, LEBCorp and Tirtom Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, SafeFed also received an emergency use license from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA accepts tests that use thermal nucleic acid reinforcement technology instead of PCR.
This method can diagnose positive results in at least 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes because it does not require a series of rotational temperature alternations.
About 18,000 of these machines are now available in the United States and Abbott wants to accelerate the production of these machines to 50,000 tests per day. A test method is being discovered in Taiwan that uses an individual antibody to bind to a coronavirus nucleoscopic protein (N protein), with the hope that testing by this method will take 15 to 20 minutes, like a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "a chest radiograph has little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be available even before symptoms".
Bi-dimensional glassware is common in environmental, antiseptic and recent emerging diseases.
Sub-pulmonary dominance and crazy pumping (a change in the platelet membrane by the addition of an alveolar or a perforated vein), and the combination may be manifested by progression of the disease.
A study comparing PCR to PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, many of its reactions were overshadowed by other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CTs should not be used for first-line testing or screening to diagnose COVID-19".As of March 2020, WHO recommended the following case definitions:
Part of the immune response to microbes is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These are used to monitor people, identify the immune system, and diagnose patients who have had symptoms in the first 7 days or so. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through a care test (PoCT).
High-level automated systems in most clinical laboratories will have the capabilities to perform tests but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
A screen blood sample for CLT is commonly used, although continuous samples are used for immune system response.
For PoCT, a blood sample is typically taken by perforating the skin.
Unlike the PCR method, no pre-test phase-out is required. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named twenty-one companies that provided notices to the agency as needed and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA through an emergency use permit. In late March 2020, Euryomon Medical Diagnostic Laboratories and Epitote Diagnostic Laboratories received European approval for their test potatoes, which can diagnose IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples per hour and therefore viral RNA is much faster than PCR testing.
Antibodies are generally diagnosable 14 years after the onset of the disease. In early April, the UK found that none of their previously used diagnostic tools were useful.
Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will tap the patient a sample", they insult him, send him back and get a test result shortly after. The British NHS has announced that it is running a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of a patient coming to the hospital or requiring an ambulance to be discharged.
The vehicle's non-diagnostic centers have helped South Korea to make tests faster and more extensive than in other countries. In Germany, the National Union of Physicists of Legal Health Insurance said on March 2 that it has a capacity of about 12,000 tests via planetary diagnosis and 10,700 tests were taken last week.
When a doctor requests a dose, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
By March 19, testing was proposed in several major cities.
The total number of tests performed as of March 26, 2020 was not known as only positive cases were reported.
Initial laboratory surveys showed that as of the week 2020/12, a total of at least 483,295 tests had been performed and 33,491 cases (6.9%) of samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the same week.In Israel, researchers at the Takenin and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for the AIDS test of samples from 64 patients at a time, which is done by combining samples, and further tests are also performed in case of a positive case in the combined samples.
With construction monitoring by BGI founder Wang Jin and a 5-day time frame, modeling shows that cases at Hubei had increased by 47% and the related cost of quarantine resolution would have doubled if this testing capacity had not emerged at the same time.
Wuhan Laboratory was immediately followed by Hu Yan Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in all 12 cities of China.
On March 4, 2020 the test capacity was 50,000 tests in a day. Open source, designs shared by Origami Asus were published that could test patient samples up to 1122 using only 93 tests for COVID-19. These parallel designs can be performed in small laboratories without the need for a mechanical fluid holder.
By March, the lack of introduction and insufficient quantity had posed a problem for mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Some authors were forced to investigate sampling protocols that included temperature sampling at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the UAE was now testing its largest population per capita for coronavirus than any other country, and had reached the level of testing of people who had tested their largest population.
This was through a combination of patient-to-site capability, and purchasing a population-level mass-testing lab from 42 and BGI Group (based on Wei's "Hu-Yan" emergency detection labs in China).
The lab, which was established in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory worldwide to conduct such tests outside of China.
The genetic profile of the coronavirus was developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different areas and conduct different testing procedures.
The World Health Organization has sent a German approach to cat production to low-income and resource-poor countries.
The German protocol was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United Nations Centers for Disease Control was not finalized until 28 January, which suspended existing tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the validity of test kits at the start of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health professionals to conduct tests.
Experts say that the wide availability of testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Large-scale testing capacity in private sector laboratories by the South Korean government was built over a period of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for speeding up testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the spread of the virus has led to the collection of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of soaps and chemicals have tightened.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems in its test kits.
In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC had "half-specifications" after which the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private laboratories from conducting tests. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Biophysical Biotechnology, but later found the results to be inaccurate.
The company said in response that the incorrect results may have been due to a problem collecting samples or the misuse of the cats.
The Spanish Ministry said it would return the cats with the wrong results, and instead receive the different test kits from the Shenzhen Biomedical Company. The Czech Republic, which purchased any test kits from China, gives 80% of the test kits the wrong results.
Prime Minister Matthews suggested that it should be converted to the Danube.Atyash Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that there were "high levels of errors" in the test kits purchased by Turkey from China and "did not use them".The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that the purchased kits were not usable.
Tests that have tested positive, patients quarantined and those who have been followed in contact with people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, have tested positive.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, which is the region with the highest COVID-19 deaths in Italy, double-checked a total population of about 3,400 people over a period of about ten days.
Nearly half of those tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected patients were quarantined.
With limited travel to the community, new diseases were completely eradicated.
Following an accidental contact, restrictions on internal travel, inspections, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is progressing much slower than in other developed countries, and there are no severe restrictions such as forced closures on restaurants and retail stores.
Many ceremonies were canceled, and Singapore advised the public to stay home until 28 March, but schools were reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed the outbreak by following random contact, restricting domestic travel, testing, and quarantining, but with low levels of lockdown or tourism restrictions.
A statistical study found that in countries with high mortality rates, the mortality rate is very low, perhaps because those countries are better able to identify those with few or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to the World Health Organization's 16 reference laboratories for testing confirmation.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are based in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "Positive as % of test" is affected by the country's test policy.
A country that only examines people who visit hospitals has a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that examines all its population, whether people have symptoms or not, but other things are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning your hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Constantly washing hands with soap at "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and diarrhea, which are transmitted from hand to mouth by the use of tissue.
People can also get respiratory illnesses such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before losing their eyes, nose and mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five sensitive times a day when washing hands with soap is important are: before and after urination, after cleaning the baby's underparts or changing the pump, before feeding the baby, before meals and before preparing meals and after or after touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If there is no water and soap available, hands can also be washed with aerosol. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing in the following situations:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after patient care.
After changing diapers or cleaning children who have had to.
After a nosebleed, cough or cold.
After touching animals, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before prescribing medication or medical care can prevent or slow the spread of disease.
The main health purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who work with food or in the medical field, but it is also important for all people.
Hand washing has many health benefits, such as reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the common causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory diseases;
and reducing infant mortality at birth in households.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing habits may lead to small improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing changes to simple habits, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can lead to a reduction in mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote handwashing can reduce nearly three-quarters of diarrhea cases, and this is linked to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), if performed automatically in homes, schools and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, which is a major component of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhoea and breast cancer cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing a consistent habit before meals and after using a toilet can save more lives than any other vaccine or medical procedure, and reduce the death rate from respiratory infections by half and deaths from respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is often associated with other health care practices as part of a water, sanitation and health care (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against deadly spores that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
The only minor adverse effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, skin-tissing condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, a condition that is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also known as an indicator of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important in reducing the transmission of diseases from contaminants to the mouth: after using the toilet (to clear the gaps or needles), after cleaning the baby's lower portions (to change the pump), before feeding the baby, before and after preparing meals and after or after touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other situations where proper hand washing technique should be used to prevent transmission of disease such as before and after a cut or injury is treated; after a rash, cough and runny nose; after handling animal waste or animal waste; and after touching the waste.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is much lower.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that the rate was highest in Saudi Arabia at 97 percent; the average in the United Arab Emirates is nearly 77 percent; and the lowest in China at 23 percent. Multiple methods of changing habits are currently available to increase the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Mass hand washing for schoolchildren at designated times of the day is a choice among the growing countries that make hand washing a habit in children.
The "Necessary Program of Health Care" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the level of action for children's health and educational development.
Treatment of chinchi twice a year, along with daily hand washing with soap, daily flossing with fluoride are the main goals of this national program.
The program is also being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is promoted by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is not effective in cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are part of organic soil, are not easily soluble in water.
Proper flow of water only helps to clean.
Solid soap, due to its recyclable properties, may retain bacteria recovered from past uses.
A few studies that have looked at bacterial transmission from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that it is less likely to occur as bacteria are purified with soap foam.
The CDC still says "It is best to use liquid soap for control of hand-to-hand contact for use by many people".
Anti-bacterial soap has been widely promoted among health professionals.
So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant or non-antibiotic drugs used in prescriptions are optimal for an antibiotic-resistant organism in nature.
However, antifungal soaps contain common antibacterial substances such as triclosan, which has a wide list of types of resistance to the organism.
So if antibiotic-resistant forms for antibiotic soaps are not adopted, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protectors, as a pH regulator, complex formulations such as antimicrobial-active benzoic acid and other skin conditions (alcohols, vitamins, menthol, plant extract) may contain acidic acid (acetic acid, scurbic acid, lactic acid).A comprehensive University of Oregon School of Public Health analysis shows that simple soaps are as effective at preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands as consumer levels of antibacterial soaps that contain triclosan.
Hot water suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
But hot soapy water is more effective at removing natural fats that contain soil and bacteria than cold soapy water.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing microbial stress on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a hand sanitizer without water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, it gained popularity as a water-free hand sanitizer (also known as an alcohol-free hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer).
Most rely on asopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed in a gel with solids such as carbohydrates (acrylic acid polymers), or haemoconts such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The spraying of hydrogen peroxide-containing solids further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective at killing germs.
Alcoholic sanitizer bacteria, resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), female diseases, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungus kill.
An alcohol-containing sanitizer that contains 70% alcohol kills 99.97% of bacteria (a 3.5 lb reduction, equivalent to a 35 dB reduction) within 30 seconds of being worn on the hands and kills 99.99% of bacteria from worn on the hands to 99.999% (4 to 5 lb reduction) within 1 minute of being worn on the hands. Hand sanitizers are highly effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against neurovirus (or norovirus) types of viruses that are the main cause of saris gastroenteritis. Enough antiseptic or alcohol should be applied to the hands to make both hands wet or dry.
The sanitizer should be applied to the front and back of the hands and between and to the ends of all fingers for about 30 seconds to dry the liquid, foam or gel.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, and extended to both veins. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with a hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are very tight.
The overuse of these substances depends on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; but they should not replace proper hand washing except if soap and water are not available.
Repeated use of an alcoholic hand sanitizer can cause dry skin without a softening or moisturizing formula.
The skin drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers containing alcohol containing softening agents cause less itching and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobial detergent.
Sensitivity to contact with dermatitis, contact with urticaria syndrome or severe sensitivity to alcohol or hand pain is less common in alcohol use.
The low inclination to irritation with dermatitis has become significantly higher than hand washing with soap and water.
In addition to their effectiveness, waterproof materials do not clean organic matter from the hands, but simply make it disinfectant.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective at preventing the spread of many pathogens as soap and water, as pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizers from alcohol to cleaners depends heavily on the ingredients and structure, and historically has been less used than alcohol and hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulas that use benzalconum chloride have been shown to have a more persistent and increased antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, and to have a decreased efficacy after repeated use, possibly due to persistent adverse reactions on the skin.
In low-income communities, many people cannot afford soap and use soap or soap instead.
Soils or soils may be more effective without water but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or areas are contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase them rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Like soap, aurea is also an anti-inflammatory because when combined with water, they form an alkaline solution.
The World Health Organization has recommended aero or salt as a substitute for soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the United Nations Center for Disease Control to prevent transmission of the disease consists of the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or freezing water.
Flowing water is recommended because the water in the cup may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not make a difference.
Apply a sufficient amount of soap and moisture to the hands, including the back of the hands, the middle of the fingers and the bottom of the nose.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people want to wash their hands better when they have soap on them instead of just washing their hands with water.
Keep it warm for at least 20 seconds.
The mold creates a tightness, which helps remove germs from the skin, and the mold removes more germs for a long time.
Wash them well under running water.
The dish can be re-dirty by washing hands in a cup.
Dry your hands with a clean hand washer or hold them to an air conditioner.
Wet and wet hands can be easily re-damaged. The most common remaining areas of the hand are stiff, dead, spaces between the fingers and the underneath fingernails.
Artificial nostrils and nail polish may give rise to microorganisms.
A moisturizer solution is often recommended to protect the hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of the disease.
In developing countries, where tap water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost options can be developed to facilitate hand washing, for example, draining water from suspended beds or nuts with adequate sour and/or using aerosol if necessary. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are then water conservation solutions, such as "type-pumps or suspended beds" and other low-cost options.
Tippy-taps or taped bushes are a type of simple technique in which a stick is tied to a rope, and the wood moved by the foot drains a small amount of water onto the hands and soaps are available alongside.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective type of drying in public toilets.
Large-scale research suggests that the paper fats found in many bathrooms are healthier than electric hand dryers.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster, London, funded by the papermaking industry called the European Textile Symposium, was conducted to compare the hygiene levels suggested by paper pulp, hot air hand dryers and other advanced handjet air dryers.
After hand washing and hand drying with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% in the fingertips and up to 254% in the urine.
Hand drying with a jet air dryer has resulted in an increase in the total number of bacteria in the fingertips by an average of 42% and 15% in the spleen.
After hand washing and paper-drying, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips decreased by an average of 76% and in the gut by 77%. Scientists also conducted these tests to determine whether any method of drying would result in contamination between other bathroom users and the bathroom environment.
The jet airlifter, which is claimed to lift air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of moving microorganisms from the hands and unit and possibly contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
A hot air hand dryer releases microorganisms up to 0.25 m from the machine.
No specific distribution of microorganisms in paper pulp has been observed. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers in the field of hand drying are comparable to paper milling.
Using hand sanitizer sand filters for hand washing is an alternative when traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after a Hungarian doctor named Ignaz Semmelweis found hand washing effective in preventing disease in a hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget them.
One study found that using them reduced infection rates.
The medical method of hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, and sufficient soap and water or gel should be used to force and all parts of the hands should be washed.
The hands should be wrapped by inserting the fingers of both hands into each other.
If there is a hole under the tips of the fingers, a brush should be used to remove it.
Since microbes may remain on hands in water, it is important to clean hands well and dry them with clean cloth.
After drying, paper must be used to seal the water (and if necessary, the exit gate can also be opened with paper).
This prevents hand contamination from those places.
Hand washing in a health care facility is intended to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the rate of handwashing in many medical settings is at an unacceptable level, with many doctors and nurses continually forgetting to wash their hands before contact with patients, thus transmitting germs.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow disorders by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing standard practices for hand washing and hand washing in healthcare sectors.
The hand hygiene manual by the organization has also been published for public comment on its website.
This relevant review was conducted by Whitby and his colleagues.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if compliance with regulations is required.
According to the World Health Organization, hands should be washed in the following "five situations":
After contact with blood/body fluids
before performing an anti-infection work, and
After treatment of the patient. Adding an anti-inflammatory chemical to soap ("medical" or "antibacterial" soap) gives a handwashing agent a killing force.
Such a germ-killing operation may be required before surgery or in medical centers where antibiotic-resistant organisms are most likely to spread. For a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a hand sanitizer that is operated and blocked without touching the hands, some chloride or washing iodine must also be available, in addition to a healthy brush to dry the hands after washing, a healthy tool for hair and a healthy tool to clean the underneath the fingernails.
All jewelry must be removed.
The procedure involves washing hands side by side for 2-6 minutes.
Hand washing for long periods (10 minutes) is not mandatory.
Water should be avoided when pouring water from the sides to the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands should be dried with a healthy towel, and surgical clothing should be worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizers before and after treating a patient.
In hospitals for the control of staph infection it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand washing came from the first 20% of hand washing and the least additional benefit was achieved when hand washing repetitions exceeded 35%.
Hand washing with simple soap causes three times more transmission of bacterial infections to food than washing with antimicrobial soap. On average, spraying alcohol-containing solutions on the hands for 30 seconds and washing hands with antimicrobial soap has been shown to reduce microbial contamination by 26% more than hand washing with antimicrobial soaps.
But soap and water are more effective than hand washing alcohols to reduce the spores of H1N1 influenza A virus and cluster deficient hand washing. Ways to improve hand hygiene in health care centers can be explored to educate employees about hand washing, increase the availability of hand-washed alcohols, and provide written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which methods are most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap has been recognized as a low-cost and essential tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has led to the challenge of making hand washing a global practice.
For example, in many rural areas of Africa handwashing taps near private or public toilets are rare, while there are affordable options for building handwashing facilities.
However, a lower level of hand washing can be a result of a poorly formed habit than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to a change in people's longstanding habits.
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary for this work to be effective.
Systematic reviews of 70 studies found that community-based behavior is effective in increasing handwashing habits in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of handwashing promotion in schools is a "three-star approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and affordable steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health concerns.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can eventually go from one star to three stars.
The creation of handwashing facilities can be part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce the rate of disease and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve the goal of habit change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis.
Several studies have considered the overall impact of the cost of handwashing associated with preventing DALYs in developing countries.
However, a review suggested that promoting handwashing with soap is much cheaper than other water and sanitation methods.
The importance of hand washing to human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have recently given birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers - was first recognized by two leading hand hygiene doctors in the mid-19th century: Hungarian doctor Agnaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale who was English and "the founder of modern nursing".
Many people at the time believed that the infections were caused by bad smells called mesmes.
In the 1980s, the United Nations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for Foodborne Diseases and Healthcare-related Infections forced the United States to more actively promote hand hygiene to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 Huey influenza pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to a growing awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infections.
For example, posters called "Right Handwashing Techniques" are hung next to the counter in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands" of an object means that someone expresses dissatisfaction with taking responsibility for the object or shares in the crime.
The text originates from the Gospel message in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to execute Jesus Christ but became a widely used phrase in English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth is forced to wash her hands in an effort to clear the imaginary stain she sees on her body, representing her guilty conscience about the crimes she committed and encouraging her husband to do the same.
It has also been found that people, after recalling or contemplating immoral acts, are forced to wash their hands more often than at other times, and place greater value on hand washing equipment.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after thinking about it are less likely to engage in other compulsory "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Symbolic hand washing, i.e. using water to wash hands without soap, is a part of hand washing rituals in many religions such as the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Telangana and the Nitalat in Judaism, Lawas in Christianity, and the Odes in Islam. Religions also recommend washing hands after certain practices in particular.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate hand washing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam all teach that people wash their hands before and after eating.
COVID-19 risk control measures at work
COVID-19 risk control measures in the workplace include the use of occupational safety and health methods to prevent the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19).
The importance of risk management measures in the workplace, the risk assessment of sources of infection, the severity of infection in the community, and the risk factors for each worker who may be susceptible to COVID-19 depend on the workplace and the workplace.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has a low working relationship with people and other workers in low-risk occupations, recommending that early prevention measures be taken to prevent the spread of disease.
Medium-risk occupations involve maintaining sustained and close contact with unknowns and people who are suspected of COVID-19 infection, but may become ill due to ongoing social transmission and international travel.
This work environment includes workers who are in contact with the public, such as schools, crowded work environments, and crowded retail outlets.
In addition to the initial prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include effective air filtration aircraft, plastic or glass screen protective screens, personal safety equipment or devices as they may be exposed to a person infected with COVID-19.
The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that health and funeral personnel, who are involved in the survey of COVID-19 infected and suspected persons, are at high risk of contracting the disease. If the staff apply procedures to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air on COVID-19 infected and suspected persons or collect or use samples from them for testing, the risk of infection increases.
Risk control measures appropriate to these personnel include engineering controls, such as negative pressure airlock rooms, and appropriate personal safety equipment.
The spread of COVID-19 can have many effects on the workplace.
Employees may not be able to go to work due to illness, the need for other caregivers, and the fear of contracting the disease.
Business practices may change, either according to the demand for goods or the means by which they are obtained (e.g., shopping in low-wage areas, or delivering fast services to the dealer/customer on its own or by car/motorcycle).
Finally, transportation routes from geographic areas that have been severely affected by COVID-19 may be cut. A preparedness and response plan against the outbreak can be used to guide safe measures.
The plans aim to reach a variety of risk levels related to work and employment, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from home, and social environments and risk factors for older and workers with persistent health conditions.
Also, the plans outline control measures to address risks and provide potential plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for pandemics may require national and regional recommendations.
The response to a pandemic outbreak aims to reduce the rate of transmission of disease among workers, save people at risk of a highly complex health condition, continue work activities, and have a side effect on other entities in the supply/supply chain of activities.
The severity of the epidemic in the society in which business activities are conducted affects the response.
A series of hierarchies of risk control measures is a framework, widely used to classify risk control measures during their impact on occupational safety and health.
In places where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control measures are the departure from engineering controls, subsequent administrative controls and finally personal safety management equipment.
Engineering controls, without relying on employee reliability, are the safeguarding of workers from work-related risks, and may be the least cost effective solution to implement this task.
Administrative controls are changes to labour policies or practices that require action by employees and managers.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can sometimes help prevent disease.
All types of personal protective equipment must be designed based on the risk to the employee, properly installed (e.g., breathing devices), continuously and properly removed, regularly inspected, maintained, and changed as needed, and properly removed, cleaned, and maintained or disposed of to prevent contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says that there is less workplace contact with people and colleagues in low-risk jobs.
The basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include repeatedly and thoroughly washing hands, telling employees to stay home if they are sick, preventing respiratory transmission of the disease, including covering up coughs and wheezing, preparing containers for paper and used items, preparing for telephonic contact or changing shifts if necessary, preventing employees from using other tools and equipment, and maintaining a clean and disinfected working environment on a daily basis.
The most important step in the safety of employees, customers, visitors, and others at work is to quickly identify and isolate potential infected individuals.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay home for at least 24 hours while using fever reducing or symptomatic medications, remove symptoms of fever, and eliminate other symptoms. Leave policies should be changeable, employees should be allowed to care for patients at home, and employees should be aware of these policies.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the mid-level risk of infection for occupational occupations includes employees who are in close contact or in close contact with people who are not infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, within 6 feet (1.8 m) of each other, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the community around workplaces or as a result of the disease, which the person has recently travelled to a place where COVID-19 has been widespread.
These include personnel who are generally in contact with the public, such as in schools, high-level multiple-purpose work environments, or retail stores or locations with high numbers of customers. Engineering controls for these and high-risk groups, the effective installation of air filters, the increase in the number of air-plasticized aircraft, the installation of physical barriers such as bright curtains, the provision of responsive services/motorcycle access to customers and fast-track services.
Workers in this risk group require a much lower respiratory rate.
Where someone is sick on board, appropriate controls for the safety of crew and other passengers include keeping a 6-foot distance from others, isolating passengers and crew from other passengers, recommending that the patient wear a mask, and asking the patient to lock their mouth and mouth on a paper bag during a cough and a run-in.
The relevant cabin passenger must use a disposable medical glove when caring for a sick passenger or touching liquid or possibly contaminated surfaces, and if possible use other personal safety equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
The transport and disposal risk controls on commercial vehicles, including high-speed trains and other passenger vehicles, include the suspension of travel when someone is ill, and if someone on board has fever or other symptoms of illness, they must be isolated and urgently notified to the medical personnel on board.
For schools and child care centers, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a temporary school leave for cleaning and disinfection in the event that a sick person has attended school without considering the social spread of the disease.
Where there is a low chance of reducing social transportation, social distancing strategies should be applied, such as field trips, meetings and other major events, such as physical education or cancelling guests at church meetings or cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, changing arrival and departure times, limiting/reducing emergency attendance, and using a separate health office space for children with symptoms such as colds.
When transmission of disease continues strongly in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. In the view of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for law enforcement personnel, who perform daily activities and activities, the level of emergency health risk is considered low.
Law enforcement officials, who may be in contact with people infected or suspected of COVID-19, are advised to follow relevant guidelines such as emergency medical personnel, including appropriate personal safety equipment.
Where close contact is made during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their belts and military clothing on homemade disinfectant sprays before second use, and follow standard operating procedures/procedures for the maintenance and disposal of used personal safety equipment and for the maintenance and washing of clothing.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reports that health and funeral workers are increasingly exposed to the disease.
Highly contagious jobs include healthcare providers, laboratory, and medical transportation workers who are exposed to and suspected of COVID-19.
If workers apply procedures to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air to people infected with and suspected of COVID-19 and collect or use samples for testing, the risk of infection is increased.
Procedures to prevent the production of particles in the air include piping into the body, cough control, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and examinations, and large-scale sampling.
High-level disease-infected burial duties include personnel involved in preparing the bodies of people who are known to be infected or suspected of COVID-19 at death. If these personnel perform a body examination, their exposure to the disease increases significantly. Additional engineering controls for this group of at-risk groups include separating rooms for COVID-19 infected and suspected patients as well as procedures to prevent the production of particles in the air.
A specific negative pressure airplane may be suitable in some medical and funeral centers.
Sampling should be done taking into account the previous measures of Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that future patients be placed in a separate waiting room to consider a suspected case of COVID-19. In addition to other personal safety equipment, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends respiratory equipment for workers who work within 6 feet of patients infected with or suspected of SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform procedures to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 face masks or better should be used in a comprehensive and prescribed respiratory safety program. This program includes appropriate, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory devices are used for greater safety and comfort for the worker. The World Health Organization does not recommend covering/covering, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. The disease is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends medical masks only for inspection personnel at the gate.
The World Health Organization recommends surgical masks, glasses, face masks, medical clothes and gloves/sticks for people who take breath samples of COVID-19 patients, care for them or transport them from one place to another without conducting procedures to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air.
If a procedure to prevent the production of particulate matter in air is performed, a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask should be used instead of a surgical mask.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed that the global provision of personal protective equipment is insufficient, that the creation of remote healthcare and physical barriers such as clean windows, reducing the need for personal protective equipment, only allowing those who directly care for COVID-19 patients to use personal protective equipment, and that only those who have a disability are recommended to use personal protective equipment without removing a respiratory mask while caring for similar patients, to supply/expose personal protective equipment, and to monitor and coordinate the supply/exhibition of personal protective equipment, and not to prescribe masks for those who are ill.

[COVID-19] Laying the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of delivery: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC

This month we find ourselves in a significant situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that highlights our international human relations and our responsibilities to each other.
We have no history of these challenges, but we know that our best response depends on a kind of global compassion, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The cooperation and attention we have had among our colleagues through emails, calls, and online conversations is the great credibility and trust of the amazing people who are fortunate to work with us.
I cannot thank you and be proud of my colleagues' consideration of you.
Last week, a person shared with me a thank you for our work.
They reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to be able to bring Wikipedia forward, and how powerful it is as an important resource that is online and accessible to everyone.
It is your job to decide whether you want to keep these websites open or to borrow money from colleagues or to keep the community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides more than ever.
This is the moment when not what we do or how we do it can have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Adjusting to your work and schedule
As Robin noted earlier, the C-Team had a meeting last night to discuss our strategy and schedule for the coming days and months.
In these conversations, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we were facing and in the process the best way to maintain the stability and firmness of the organization or institution.
We wanted to ease the pressure and support our mission in the long run.
If you want to dial it again, no problem.
For all employees, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work expectation is 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not have any vacation  If you can work longer than normal hours, you can be used for the mission.
Yet, the world is not so predictable these days, and your well-being is our priority, whether you're taking care of your own pets, buying a home or seeing a doctor.
We don't waste your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This must be done without saying, yet we tell you.
No sick leave or PTO required  Just tell your manager and help your team review the anniversaries and schedules to make sure key work elements are covered.
(If you have a positive COVID-19 outcome, please notify Brian T&C Ops so know T&C who can help you and ensure your situation is properly addressed by management).
Hourly workers are paid their full pay.
We have said before and again we respect our contractors and our hourly staff for their commitment.
Each person will be paid on the basis of their normal hours under normal circumstances.
If you are sick and unable to work, include.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people around the world use their work as a way to reverse their stress.
What we do is incredibly rewarding, especially at a time like this.
Again, it means taking care of yourself.
What you're asked to do is talk to your manager, know what to expect and adjust yourself in the same way.
Some tasks are considered important.
There are some things we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &, Security and Capital Attraction teams (among others) are doing important work that may require additional assistance.
We will start a process together with all agencies to reach our current goals and focus on supporting what is important to our mission.
There are so many organizations that do it for us, we all have to focus on the most important projects.
For now, a dry walk does not cause pain.
We do not plan to "give twice as much time to supply" as the pandemic ends.
You are not expected to do this extra work to meet multiplication, because it is now imaginary and unrealistic.
We accept that the situation has changed, and we must work to set new goals and timetables.
What happens to an annual plan?
To adapt to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule to present our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan, which takes a lot of time to budget and gives employees the opportunity to prioritize important work, self-care, compassionate care, while replacing those who want to work on a reduced schedule in the coming weeks.
The extension of time limits greatly reduces the volume and pressure of current planning work across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and will send updates to the teams on new measures and updates as we receive confirmation.
Thanks to the leadership of the APP team in this regard.
Office status, exposure to disease, and cleanliness
Last week, we received news that our SF staff may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
Yet, taking a series of precautions, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect every surface as well as the lobes and the hips of the elevators that reach our floor.
Maintenance tasks in buildings use protocols and use materials that contribute to the safety of tenants.
We feel reassured that the office will be ready for the return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared a COVID-19 protocol with us and DC-related employees.
Since last week, our DC office has been moved to a completely remote location in accordance with a shared guide with San Francisco.
As our relevant colleagues in New York City know, we are discussing and discussing the rental of a venue in Brooklyn on our own.
These talks are ongoing, but may also be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working in remote areas for the first time.
Our longtime remote colleagues know that this can be a form of discipline, and they want to offer you some suggestions:
Limit the length of sessions to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how the session can be divided into several sessions over the course of several days.
Make the purpose of the meeting clear, have an agenda, and send the reading material before the meeting.
Run videos on Google Docs and Zoom tools to create live help and collaboration and contact.
Appoint a leader to organize each meeting. Someone to monitor conversations about questions and follow the list of speakers and someone to help take notes (or take notes jointly).
If you need a quiet microphone or headphones, send an email to the tech support section.
Use your wellness allowance for breakfast.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The Human Resources Activities team looks at webinar-based ergonomic guidance to support the delivery of distributed work across the entire foundation.
Last week we asked community-related contractors to cancel publicly funded Wikimedia-supported programs, such as Editatons, until the World Health Organization announces the end of the pandemic.
They informed us that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions might make it impossible to carry out their contractual activities and that no one would be penalized for delaying such activities or changing their objectives.
Next week we will begin monitoring other guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and community-themed conferences.
The general sense of the global community seems to be depressed by the chaos, but calm and comfortable in the clarity and ability to focus on their communities, Wikipedia and others.
Moving forward, CRT is working on building a page in MetaTrader to create an environment for the community to monitor impacts and track our interactions with them.
Being involved in COVID-19 related topics
We will send an invitation to your birthday on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT, for a special working meeting.
We will use this time to share additional new information, answer your questions and connect with each other.
We are all in this together and if we can help each other in this way.
In addition, you can continue to find information on this email address and find other important COVID-19-related information on Office Wiki.
CRT will update the pages and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain a continuous relationship with employees who are currently based in many of the most influential countries.
If you have questions about travel, programs, major workflows, coverage-related challenges, or anything else that you need help with, you can no doubt contact CRT and contact them.
We want to provide assistance and establish contacts when needed.
If you have confidential and sensitive information, please email Brian Joden, Head of Global Human Resources Operations.
No change should be seen as a departure from work and responsibilities.
It is a kind of recognition that at a time when our work and responsibilities must be organized in a way that was not previously organized.
These are steps that we believe are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue our work, manage our activities with the help they need and manage the world with a service they can trust.
Our planned work will be waiting for us in due course.
For now it is time to create a space for each other to support and do the important work that may be faced in the coming weeks and possibly months.
To achieve this goal, we need you, and we ask you to keep your dreams and dreams alive, so that you will be ready and cared for when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (in Amanda, Amy, Brian Jay, Dorian D., Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jim V, Janine Y, Lisa S, Robin E, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) with decreased angotensin II doses and increases in Ang1 (1-7) and thus becomes a promising drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc, containing a metallic enzyme and localized to the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptide M2 domain and the renal amino acid-transmitting domain of the C-terminal clenarine.
ACE2 is a single translocation type I membrane protein, with an enzyme-activated domain, and appears on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of ACE2 is separated from the trans-membrane domain by another enzyme known as shadase, and the last soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted through the urine or mucous membranes.
ACE2 is present in many organs: ACE2 is associated with the endothelial cells of the main lung type II ovarian cells, the small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and vascular endothelial cells, and the arterial muscle cells in most organs.
The ACE2 mRNA form is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, pituitary gland, and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a balance for ACE.
ACE is a vector that isolates angiotensin II into the hormone angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, separates the carboxylic terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and converts it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9] - bradycyanin, epinephrine, neurotensin, denorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane that is neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is infected with Hartenapp's disease.
As a trans-membrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface causes endocytosis and transmission of both viruses and enzymes that reside in cells.
This entry process also requires the provision of S protein by the host siren protein TMPRSS2, which is currently under investigation as a potential treatment for this prevention. This has led some to speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight disease.
However, many professional associations and regulatory agencies have recommended continuing to use standard ACE inhibitors and ARB treatments.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those who had stroke and heart disease.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia".
The human synthesis of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for acute lung injuries and appears to improve pulse haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in mice with the degenerative acute respiratory syndrome of lepposarcard.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the effect (duration) for 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be an upbeat drug for those who are intolerant of classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where angiotensin II is elevated. Injection of rhACE2 for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.
b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software apps designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example, the process of identifying individuals ("connections") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Different applications in some regions and jurisdictions were developed or proposed with official support from governments.
Many frameworks have been developed to build a relationship tracking app.
Privacy concerns have arisen, especially with regard to systems built based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
A small number of annoying alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to allow the user to log in to other mobile phones as they approach.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would jointly support these Bluetooth-based apps to work directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has created an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have been infected with COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by the IT Regional Association, which is released as free source and will be submitted to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based application called "StopKorona!" to track contact with potential patients and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracking app is in the final stages of development, and will be available in a few weeks. A similar app is also planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geofencing app in Moscow for patients infected with COVID-19, and the format is designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including the error-positive outcome and the potential lack of effectiveness if app use is limited to only a small percentage of the population.
Given concerns about the release of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set restrictions on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to the Apple Store. It has restricted them to only "official" or, in other words, reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly about whether surveillance infrastructure built to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be eliminated once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The above organizations announced eight conditions regarding government projects:
The monitoring must be "legal, mandatory and appropriate";
Extensive surveillance and surveillance must have an end to poverty;
Use of the data will be restricted to COVID-19 purposes;
The security and uncertainty of information must be maintained and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should prevent discrimination and marginalization;
Sharing of information with third parties should be defined in law;
There must be protections against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
Significant participation is required by all "living stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalised groups. The German Censorship Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published checklists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan is to address the problem of ongoing monitoring by removing tracking mechanisms from its device's operating systems when no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of app, eliminating the need to download an app and having the ability to prevent tracking.
In Israel, a network-based pursuit was approved.
Network Performance solutions that access raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all central systems require having central servers to access personal location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems are built-in that use central servers only for internal communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an appless system was used to conduct contact tracking.
Rather than using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking data from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to notify potentially infected individuals via short messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contact persons, the government has also released public access to location information, which has been allowed to do so due to the widespread changes in data privacy laws in the country since the outbreak of MERS.
People access this information through a number of apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, use centralized and privacy systems.
As of 6 April 2020, no details have yet been released.
Privacy protection contact tracking is an emerging good idea, with a substantial portion of literature research tracing back at least to 2013.As of 7 April 2020, dozens of groups of experts were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to connect to other mobile phones as the user gets closer.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and does not have a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracking of proximity privacy protection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact event numbers, CEN), privacy sensitivity protocols and mobile communication tracking mechanisms (PACT) and more.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all comparisons are made on the device.
The Privacy Group is developing SafePaths at MIT Media Lab when collecting and using location or route cross-sectional data to track the COVID-19 outbreak, which is a platform for using privacy protection techniques.
It is a platform based on a research published in March 2020 in the white paper "Apps Gone Wrong: Protecting Privacy in Pandemic".A similar effort is the creation of the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies and was originally developed at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses hardware-secure technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising the privacy of that information.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Alliance was formed by a number of groups that combined around the same approaches and broadly-based protocols aimed at promoting analytics, and providing a framework for international cooperation in tracking and alerting applications that is a key aspect of achieving wide-ranging usage goals.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had released the BlueTrace protocol as open source for use by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track connectivity, which they claim will protect privacy and will be built on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protected cryptography.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is expected to be implemented in three phases:
Launching tools to enable governments to create official privacy tracking apps for coronavirus
Directly integrate this functionality into iOS and Android Google and Apple Plan to solve the startup and ongoing monitoring problems first by distributing the system via an operating system update and then in the same manner when the threat is over by removing data.
In place of the treatment of the disease for which it was originally designed, a change in the drug's position (also known as using a drug for another purpose, reprofiling, re-appointing or changing a treatment) refers to the reuse of an accepted drug to treat another disease or medical condition.
It is a line of scientific research currently being pursued to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other directions of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of plasma to the duct. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug-eluting proteins, each with multiple ligand binding points.
Analysis of these closing points offers a suitable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papine-type proteins, RNA-related RNA polymers, helix, S protein, and ADP ribophosphates.
A. Hussain and colleagues studied a number of selective compounds, which they then optimized and analyzed to find similarity of skeletal muscle to the most commonly accepted medicines, to accelerate the development of strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in preclinical studies and to propose them to a clinical research project.
Chlorokine is a type of antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chlorine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied as part of a cohesive clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State trial of chlorine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment for these drugs has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is approved by the EUA only as an emergency use experimental treatment on patients who are hospitalized but are not fit for treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been determined.
Doctors said they would use the drug until they "have no choice".
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in a combination of zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major research is underway at Duke and Oxford Universities.
NYU Longon Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and effectiveness of the prevention use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed and shown that faviparous is a "clearly effective" drug.
The treatment was negative for an average of four days in 35 patients in Shenzhen, compared with 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, half of the patients were given favipropreparam and half were given omefinoir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Authority has reminded people that the available evidence for drugs is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase medicines from Japan for storage, and use the military to deliver medicines to university hospitals, where the drugs would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shenzhou Abe has made recommendations to the Trump administration about buying medicines. Medicines may be less effective in severe cases of the disease in places where the virus has already spread several times.
The use of the drug may not be safe for pregnant women or those who plan to become pregnant.
A study of lupinevir/retonavir (Calitra), a combination of antiviral lupinevir and retonavir, concluded that "it is of no benefit".
The drug was designed to prevent HIV from recurring by binding to proteins.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that is associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protein. There are anti-nuclear claims in the scientific community that lead to sources providing approved drugs for the treatment of other diseases, especially drugs made for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization also included Lupinvir/Retonvir in the global cohesion trial.
The remdeserve was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that the remdeserve had antiviral activity in the vets against multiple influenza, pneumo-, paramexo-, and coronaviruses.
One issue of antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some pre-trial research suggests that remdesvir may be a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, two of which were conducted by University of Cleveland hospitals; one on people with moderate to severe illnesses and another on people with more severe illnesses.
Three clinical trials of vitamin C are underway in patients who are hospitalized and have severe COVID-19 infections; two are placebo-controlled (China, Canada), and one is uncontrolled (Italy).

The study, called COLCORONA, involved 6,000 adults over the age of 40 who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or those who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible for this study.
Numerous anti-aging substances have been tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight hyperin is widely used to treat patients, and the Italian Pharmaceutical Administration is encouraged to publish guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a study of 300 patients in Italy was announced by several centers conducting research into the treatment and use of anoxaparin sodium.
Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the reuse of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous diseases such as MRES, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Rebavirin: According to the Chinese 7th edition guidelines, Rebavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19
Amphienovir: Amphienovir was recommended as a treatment for COVID-19 in accordance with the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some of the antibiotics that are known to be potentially reusable medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 are:
Tocilizumab (an IL-6 anti-receptor drug): approved by China.
Also tested in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a fake vaccine against the coronavirus pandemic 2019.
Although clinical trials on no vaccine have been completed, much effort is underway to develop such a vaccine.
In February 2020, the World Health Organization said it did not expect to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a related or causative virus, in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were included in the Phase I safety trials in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Worldwide, the outbreak reached a peak in 2020, resulting in significant investment and research activity on a vaccine development.
Many organizations are using the published genome to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
As revealed in April, the CEPI's initiative needed to develop a vaccine consists of speed, manufacturing capacity, provision of a fixed amount of information, and global access.
In April, scientists reported that as of early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that progress in Phase I safety research included are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (first phase promoter and vaccine candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vector (first phase promoter and vaccine candidate: cannabinoid biology, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 39 more announced but with little public information available (considered to be under planning or in the process of being drafted).
Phase I-II testing, in which the safety and immunogenicity test is performed, is generally randomized, placebo-controlled, and multi-site, while also determining the most accurate and effective dosage/dose.
Phase III trials are generally highly participatory. These participants include a control group, the efficacy of vaccine testing to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects in hopeful doses/doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in the active development phase approved as of early April 2020, 74 have not been tested in human evaluation (yet in preclinical trials).
Around 24 April 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that the university was undergoing research into a possible molecular-containing vaccine that genetically mutates viral proteins to induce an immune response.

have been integrated into vaccine development and production.
Both partners announced plans for preclinical trials and Phase I of clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working on 11 microbial signals separately, and that as soon as possible, it will take about two years to develop a vaccine from the Ionium.
On 12 March 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City reported on the development and manufacture of coronavirus particles that were partially funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine is a laboratory study in addition to a human trial scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump paid heavily to Kaurbach for widespread access to a COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with a German biotech company to develop an MRI-based vaccine.
The following is a selection of MRNA-based vaccines BNT162, which are currently undergoing preclinical trials, with clinical trials beginning in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Taxis Biotech, an Italian company, announced that they will receive preclinical test results in April 2020 and the vaccine will begin human trials in autumn/autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Five Plague Preparations in France announced $4.9 million in investment for a COVID-19 vaccine research association. The alliance includes the Institut Pasteur, Thames Biosciences (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Petersburg, which brings the total investment of the CEPI to $29 million to develop the vaccine.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Cuevaque, Inuit, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different selective vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was manufactured from China with a 14 day supply of the vaccine.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on COVID-19 medical prevention measures, including a selection of vaccines, at Canadian companies and universities such as the University of Medicine and the Saskatchewan Initiative.
Meanwhile, the Government of Canada has announced a specific grant of C$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. It includes plans to create a "vaccine bank" of various new vaccines to be used to spread/repair the coronavirus variant.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Petersburg Medical School reported on a pathogen trial. It is a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice. The report stated, "MNAs delivered second-dose SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines that stimulated strong antibody-specific responses to antigens [in mice] that appeared within 2 weeks of immunization".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced a DNA-selective vaccine scheme as a possible injection through a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replace bacteria inside the human body to produce harmless particles/particles like viruses that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities, including Hewlett-Dawd Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, joined forces and shared their resources to acquire supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called adverse effects/abnormalities.
This means that they can have other benefits besides disease prevention.
Australia wants to hire 4,170 health workers for randomized controlled trials/exams of the lorry.
A vaccine may not be safe and effective as it is in development.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-related animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human animals, requires global coordination to ensure Tier 3 biosecurity measures and standardised safety procedures to control live viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human or animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine for SARS treatment or safety has yet been developed to prove it is both safe and effective for humans.
According to studies published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SERS were a priority for all governments and public health agencies worldwide. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When the MERS was published, it was believed that existing SARS research might provide a robust sample for vaccine and drug development against MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was only one DNA-based MERS vaccine that has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three more are in development. All vaccines are viral-transmitted vaccines, two others are Adenoviral-Victord or ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac, and one is the MVA-ERS-SAM vaccine.
Social media posts have expanded to a conspiracy theory claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not previously known and that a vaccine was not already available.
The registered inventions cited by a large number of social media posts provided the basis for the inventions available for other variants of the coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus, hereditary strains and vaccines.
COVID-19 or BCOVID-19 is an infectious disease that causes the symptoms of acute respiratory illness, which is characterized by the coronavirus 2.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, nausea, chest pain, loss of sense of smell, and nausea.
The incubation period and onset of symptoms is about five days but may take anywhere from two to fourteen days.
While many cases have normal symptoms, some include viral diarrhea and dysfunction of many organs.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported from 210 countries and regions worldwide, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been rescued. The virus is often spread through small droplets during early contact between people, often through coughing, sneezing and talking.
While these droplets are produced during respiratory circulation, they usually descend on the ground or other surfaces, but are not a virus that can be transmitted over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching the dirty surface and then touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus could survive for 72 hours on different surfaces.
Symptoms are most prevalent and contagious within three days of onset, although the virus is also spread before symptoms appear or during the late stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis of the disease is by means of a source transcription polymerase chain reaction via the neurofaringeal swab/dc.
The use of masks is then recommended for those who are suspected of having the virus.
Recommendations for wearing a mask vary among the public, with some authorities recommending not to use it, some recommending it and some recommending it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment available to treat COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in all six regions of the World Health Organization, in many countries.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or may not have symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and cough.
Symptoms of an emergency include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain and pressure, congestion, difficulty waking up, red faces and shoulders; it is recommended that emergency medical attention be sought in contact with these symptoms or symptoms.
Unusually, symptoms of the upper respiratory system include diarrhea, nausea, or chest pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, coughing and diarrhea/nausea have been observed in different percentages.
Initially, only chest pains and heartbeats were seen in some cases in China.
In some, the disease has spread to the chest, disabling most organs and leading to death.
This is called the incubation phase.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically six days but may vary between two and 14.
It takes 11.5 days for 97.5% of people with symptoms to become infected with the virus. Reports show that not all people infected with the virus have symptoms.
The role of these symptom-free carriers is not yet known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
The proportion of people infected with the virus who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and under investigation. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 20% of all confirmed cases were hospitalized without symptoms.
The National Health Commission of China also began registering daily cases of no symptoms from April 1, with 130 or 78% of the 166 people tested positive for the virus on the same day.
There was a high prevalence of the virus in the Netherlands and Belgium.
Speaking out loud than normal speech releases many drops.
A study in Singapore found that a coughing spider can carry a mouth drop up to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus is not transmitted through air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that biovirus transmission may be possible and air purifiers installed outside public rooms in the hallway have found samples that tested positive for viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as pipe-passage/setting and cardiopulmonary resuscitation may cause respiratory tract to become aerosolised and subsequently cause the virus to spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that it is transmitted through waste materials, the risk of it is low in confidence. The virus is most common when people have symptoms and symptoms; while it is possible to spread before symptoms appear, and the risk may be low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while it is clear how easily a disease can spread, a person can generally infect two to three people with the virus.
Specifically, viruses could survive up to one day on paperboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and iron (AISI 304) and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, the survival of the virus on these surfaces depends on humidity and weather.
Soaps and detergents that are used properly are highly effective; soap-related substances remove the virus-protective double coating, disable it, and remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solvents, such as benzalconum chloride and chlorhexidine gluconite, are also less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, samples of dead bodies were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In six out of five patients, the first sample showed that the virus was taken at high doses, and the sixth patient showed that the virus was taken at high doses on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three breastfeeding individuals in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in their nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the use of soap in homes, breaking the virus's protective covering. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the original form of SARS-CoV.
Fibrosis is the most affected organ of the body by COVID-19, as the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is highly concentrated in lung type 2 perforated cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called a "spike/spike" (peplomer) and binds to the ACE2 enzyme and penetrates the corresponding cells of that enzyme.
Acute heart attack was found in 12% of patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe cases.
The incidence of heart disease symptoms during the course of the disease is high due to the inflammatory response and disorders in the immune system, but heart muscle injury may be associated with an ACE2 enzyme receptor/receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors/receptors appear in the heart and perform their function in the heart.
In emergency rooms, high blood clots (31%) and kidney disease (25%) were found in people with COVID-19 infection, which may be caused by a lack of awareness of the disease.
Although the respiratory system of the SARS-COV-2 virus has a defense system for ACE2-exposing epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic high levels of inflammation.
Specifically, coal-producing GM-CSF-filtering T-cells have been shown to be associated with the accumulation of inflammatory IL-6-filtering monosites in COVID-19 infected patients and with severe lung damage diagnosis or pathology.
The presence of lymphocytic infiltrates has also been reported in body counting.
The World Health Organization has published numerous protocols for testing for disease.
The armor-based transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is a standard test method.
Typically, the test is performed on breathing samples obtained by nasopharyngeal duct. However, nasopharyngeal duct or pulp samples may also be used.
Test results are obtained in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be performed, but this test requires two blood samples, with a second sample taken two weeks after the first and the results of each sample taking much less time.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate and distribute a genetic sequence with the coronavirus form/originality, allowing laboratories around the world to independently conduct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect disease through the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which is found to be an active disease and that a person has already been infected with the disease) was in development, but has not been widely used.
The accuracy and accuracy of Chinese experiments with examination is only 60 to 70 percent.
The United States FDA approved the first care test or examination for use later this month on 21 March 2020. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Hospital for Life-Saving Diseases recommended methods for diagnosing diseases based on clinical symptoms and epidemiological risk.
Bi-dimensional glassware is common in environmental, antiseptic and recent emerging diseases.
Sub-pulmonary dominance and crazy pumping (a change in the platelet membrane by the addition of an alveolar or a perforated vein), and the combination may be manifested by progression of the disease.
Little data on the microscopic wound and pathophysiology of COVID-19 is available.
Important findings of the damage detection during a body examination are as follows:
Microscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary oedema or accumulation of fluid in the airways and tissues of the lungs.
There are four types of viral breast cancer, with severity or severity:
Common breast: pulmonary oedema or fluid buildup in the airways and tissues of the lungs, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large irregular pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration alongside interstitial/solar inflammation and the formation of large multi-nuclear cells.
Severe chest pain: inflammatory bowel disease in the lungs in addition to severe changes in lung structure (DAD).
Severe changes in lung structure (DAD) are caused by symptoms of severe respiratory distress disorder (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Recovering breast: Inflammatory bowel disease and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis occurred in the lungs.
Blood: deep intracranial blood clotting (DIC); locuritroblastic response
To reduce the chances of getting infected with the virus, preventive measures include staying at home, avoiding crowded spaces, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching mouth, eyes, and nose with unclean hands.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends mouth and mouthwash with paper towel when coughing or sneezing.
Proper hand hygiene after any cough and cold.
Also, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using face masks/tops in public places to reduce the rate of transmission of the virus from a person with symptoms. The goal of social distancing strategies is to increase the level of contacts of people with the virus with more people, by closing schools and workplaces, imposing travel restrictions, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distance guidelines also state that people should stay at least 6 feet (1.8m) apart from each other.
There is clearly no effective vaccine yet to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. Although a vaccine is not expected by 2021, a key part of COVID-19 prevention is an attempt to reduce the spread of the disease to a higher level, known as "prevention/prevention".
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that people wash their hands several times for 20 seconds, especially after not going to the bathroom or when their hands are dead/dirty, before eating and after cleaning the dishes, coughing and sneezing.
The Centre also recommends the use of 60% alcohol-containing hand sanitizer/sanitizer, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization offers two formulas of local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help prevent bacterial eggs in alcohol. It is "not an active ingredient in the destruction of hand germs".
Glycerol is added as a solvent.
People are treated with supportive care, which includes fluid treatment, oxygenation, and assistance with other vital organs/foods affected.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people suspected of the virus wear a simple mask.
External oxygenation (ECMO) is used to address problems of respiratory system dysfunction, but the benefits of this method are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to strengthen the immune system.
Supportive treatments are beneficial for those with normal symptoms in the early stages of the disease. The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for care for people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Psychiatrists and lung specialists in the United States have published treatment recommendations as a free source from various agencies, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some healthcare professionals recommend a prostatamol (acetaminophen) from ibuprofen as a first-time use to relieve symptoms.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health centers when performing procedures, such as injecting a pipe into the body or manually airing a patient that can produce particles in the air.
For healthcare professionals caring for people infected with COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends placing a patient in an Air Virus Infection Room (AIIR), including standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment during an epidemic.
What items and devices are prescribed: personal protective medical clothing, respiratory or facial masks, eyeglasses/eyewear, medical gloves/towels. If possible, respiratory or facial masks are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved the use of a face mask under the Official Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
These masks are designed to protect against particles such as dust and dust in the air, but they guarantee their effectiveness against a specific biological virus, without any indicated use.
When there are no masks, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using homemade face lifeguards as a recent effort.
Many cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternative ventilation, but in some cases they are necessary.
For COVID-19-related patients, respiratory assistants have been actively investigated in hospitals to disable the respiratory system. Some evidence suggests that pipe insertion should not be used during a breathing tube in a pajamas or on a bi-directional positive air pressure machine (BiPAP).
Whether these two methods will be equally beneficial for those who are seriously ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to use mechanical ventilators by mouth because this technique restricts airborne particulate release much more than breathing in the pacifier. Severe cases are typically more common in white hair (over 60, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds in hospitals for every person, limiting the capacity of the health system to control the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases that are required for hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of patients were admitted to ICU, 2.3% needed ventilator mechanical assistance and 1.4% died.
Nearly 30% of COVID-19 patients in China are finally admitted to hospital ICU.
Mechanical ventilators are becoming more complicated as symptoms of acute respiratory illness in COVID-19 increase and oxygen delivery becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control mode and PEEP capabilities should have higher oxygen levels, while also reducing the risk of pneumocorrosion and pneumothorax associated with the ventilator.
High-level PEEP may not be performed on older ventilators.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and many antiviral drugs are being tested in clinics.
Remedies seem to be becoming a very uncomfortable drug.
Although the development of new drugs may continue through 2021, many of the drugs tested are already approved or in advanced form for further use.
Antiviral drugs may be administered to people who are severely ill.
The World Health Organization calls on volunteers to participate in testing the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. The FDA has temporarily authorized the administration of recovered patient plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the patient's life is seriously and urgently at risk.
This experimental treatment has not been tested during clinical trials to show it is safe and effective for disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was launched in China to help fight the spread of the pandemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
App monitoring data can be used to detect "close contacts" and the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
Where possible risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also advises local health authorities. Large-scale data analytics, pattern recognition technology, mobile monitoring and artificial intelligence are used on mobile data to monitor patients who have interacted with people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government asked security agencies to monitor mobile data of people who may have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to implement quarantine and protect people who may have contact with people infected with the virus.
Also in March 2020, Dutch Telecom shared location data collected with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate the virus and prevent its spread.
Russia has hired face-to-face technology to identify and track down quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Guglio Galleria, said he was notified by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are walking around".
The German government has given 48 hours of weekend leave in the presence of more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kirsty Kollagold called for a new solution to the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or an illness/virus.
BBC spokesman Rory O'Connor said: "Fearful social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and economic downturns are a sudden storm of damage to people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be passed on normally in addition to the presence or absence of some symptoms and the presence of other common diseases of the colon such as the common cold.
Normal incidents typically occur for up to two weeks, while recovery from severe and severe incidents may take three to six weeks.
Based on data from viruses similar to SARS and MERS, pregnant women are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection due to the severity of the disease, but there are no relevant data on COVID-19. Some people infected with COVID-19 may be affected by breastfeeding and develop breast cancer.
In severely affected people, the COVID-19 virus can quickly cause acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) symptoms that result in a respiratory system failure, spread throughout the body and disabling many organs.
Complicated conditions associated with COVID-19, the spread of the virus throughout the body, irregular blood clotting, damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Blood clots, especially at increased prothrombin time, have been found in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while renal dysfunction has been observed in 4% of patients in this group.
An increase in the level of the liver transaminase enzyme was observed in approximately 20-30% of those infected with COVID-19.
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, plus five days in hospital.
In addition, people admitted to the ICU had an average of seven days between bedtime and death.
According to an early case study, the average time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with the total time from six to 41 days to the time of illness and death.
According to a study by China's National Health Commission, the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Postmortem histopathological examinations of lung samples showed lesions in both lung tissues and with cellular fibromycosiditis inflammatory filtration in both lungs.
Cytopathic mutations of the virus were observed in nomosacytes.
The lung imaging was similar to the symptoms of acute respiratory disease.
In 11.8% of the reported deaths, high levels of troponin and heart disease have been monitored by the National Health Commission of China.
According to March data, 89% of hospitalized patients in the United States had symptoms of allergies. Access to medical resources and the socioeconomic status of a region may affect mortality.
Estimates of deaths from such a condition vary due to regional differences, but also due to methodological differences.
A low number of normal cases can lead to higher than estimated mortality rates.
Yet, the fact that deaths from past infections mean that current estimates of deaths are less than realistic.
Among non-smokers, the risk of severe COVID-19 infection is 1.4 times higher among smokers and the risk of hospitalization and death in ICU is nearly 2.4 times higher.
Hong Kong hospital officials noted a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity among people who recovered from the disease and showed organ damage in lung scans.
This may be due to physical, mental and emotional symptoms after the patient leaves the ICU following the recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether pre-existing diseases would produce effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Based on the behaviour of other forms of coronavirus, there is a potential for a change in immunity, but cases of coronavirus positive recovery from COVID-19 have been reported.
These incidents are believed to cause a persistent disease to worsen rather than a new bacterium.
The belief about the virus is that it is a natural virus and originates from animals through a wide range of microbes.
The original source is unknown, but in December 2019 the virus began to spread almost completely from one person to another.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, showed that the earliest date for the onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The official publications of the World Health Organization indicated the earliest date for the onset of the disease's symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Many measures are commonly used to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the onset of the disease, and people's specifications, such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization used the ICD-10 disease emergency codes. The U07.1 code is for deaths confirmed in a laboratory with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the U07.2 code is for deaths clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 virus without laboratory confirmation. The death-to-death ratio is based on the number of cases diagnosed at a given time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global post-mortem rate is 6.9% as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the incidence mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who died from a disease, and the viral mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics are not timely and follow specific people affected by the disease through incident recovery.
While many people do not produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide insight into why so many people are infected with the virus.
A small village in Italy at the centre of the outbreak, Castiglione di Baud, home to 4,600 people, died from 80 (1.7%) to 1.5%.
In Gangliat, the disease spread due to carnival celebrations, and spread to young people with relatively low mortality rates and thus the deaths of all those infected with COVID-19 could not be officially concealed.
Moreover, the German healthcare system was not yet under pressure.
According to blood donors, approximately 3% of people in the Netherlands had antibodies.
69 confirmed deaths (0.004% of the total population) have been reported from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary among women and men.
Research in China and Italy shows that the mortality rate among men is high.
The risk age for men is 50, with the gap between men and women closing only at age 90.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The main reason for this gender difference is unknown, but hereditary and procedural factors may be explained.
Gender-based immunological differences, with a lower prevalence among women than men and the simultaneous presence of multiple diseases in men than women, such as hypertension in adolescence, can lead to an increase in mortality.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the United States government did not monitor gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS virus disease affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to get the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease should be "COVID-19".
WHO head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has stated that the name CO comes from the coronavirus, virus VI, disease D and 19 when the disease was first identified and identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geography (such as China), animal, or group of people. The name was chosen in accordance with international recommendations to avoid stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the World Health Organization has used the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 causative virus" in its general statements.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the outbreak's start in Wuhan, China, the virus and the outbreak were both referred to as "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO's 2015 Guideline on Places to Be Named for Diseases and Viruses provisionally named 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory illnesses for viruses and diseases.
Official names, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers produce healthcare products and accessories such as kitchen cleaner cotton fillers and respirator parts.
For example, when a hospital in Italy needed a respiratory headset, and the supply company was not provided in a timely manner, a newly operating company produced 100 headphones in one night.
Since the first outbreak of COVID-19, dozens of theories, misinformation and misinformation about the source, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease have been circulated and quickly circulated on the Internet.
Humans can transmit and transmit viruses to certain animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral symptoms in frogs, mice and chickens.
No medication or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is ongoing by governmental organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "probability test" to evaluate the beneficial effects of four existing antiviral compounds in the hope of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but many agencies are actively developing vaccines.
SARS-CoV is benefiting from prior work because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccine development strategies are under investigation.
The first strategy aims to develop a vaccine for the entire virus.
The use of such a virus, whether dead or inactivated, is to stimulate the rapid response of the human immune system to the novel COVID-19 virus.
The second strategy is to develop sub-vaccines that aim to develop a vaccine that will make the immune system vulnerable to virus subtypes.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-spike proteins that assist with entry to the ACE2 enzyme receptor with the virus.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for making a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines from each of these strategies should be used for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine in Seattle began on four volunteers.
An inherited harmless code from the virus that causes disease in vaccines. An antibody-based reinforcement has been proposed as a possible challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this has sparked much debate.
Since April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, with four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Many Chinese studies included studies of other disease drugs, with nine/9 phase III trials on remedicivor reportedly conducted in many countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic study of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and medicines has been conducted. Many existing antiviral drugs are under evaluation and research for the treatment of COVID-19. These include remedicivores, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/arithnovir and lupinavir/retonavir as well as interpheral beta.
There is experimental evidence of efficacy of Remdesivir as of March 2020.
Clinical advances have been observed in the treatment of patients recovering from low use of remediciver.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China, and Italy. Chlorokine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
Nevertheless, a joint review of the study is called for.
Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chlorine.
In addition, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a dose of one gram per day, notes that taking the drug twice a day is much more dangerous and potentially fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency request for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the request of doctors to treat patients infected with COVID-19. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also mention the use of interferon, rabavirein, or yomifenovir against COVID-19.
Early data suggest that high levels of ribavirin are needed to increase the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in test sites.
A large study of nitatoxanyde in test sites was recommended after showing a low concentration of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Studies have shown that pumping high levels of protein is important for the insertion of SARS-CoV-2 via a binding to the ACE2 receptor via transmembrane protease serine 2.
Studies of chlorophyll and hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin have significant limitations that have prevented the health community from using it in treatment without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in test sites and has no apparent role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytocin storms can complicate health conditions in the critical and late stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytoquinogenic properties. The National Health Commission of China included the drug tosalizumab in its treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
After showing positive results in severe patients, a nationwide randomized phase 2 trial is underway in Italy.
This test, which is related to serum ferritin blood tests to detect cytokine thunderstorms, is intended to prevent developments that are thought to be causing death in some affected patients.
An interloquin-6 receptor antagonist has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine symptoms caused by any separate cause, CAR T cell, 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tosylizumab can be considered an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of fluids and solid antibodies produced by the immune system of COVID-19 survivors to those who need them is under investigation as a non-vaccine method of inactivated immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS without results.
Viral neutralization is a predictable mechanism of action that underpins inactivated antibody treatment to strengthen the immune system against SARS-CoV-2.
But other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or fugasitosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are also being developed using monoclonal coupled antibodies.
The production of serum from recovered patients, which involves extracting blood fluid from recovered patients and using specific antibodies to the virus, can increase the number of cases to spread rapidly throughout the body.
Coronavirus, a group of related symptoms
Lee Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who raised awareness about the spread of the virus, was infected with the COVID-19 virus and died.
