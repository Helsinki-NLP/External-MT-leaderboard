While it appears that an experimental vaccine could reduce the number of Ebola deaths, to date, no cure has been clearly shown to be suitable for curing the ongoing infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, the ZMapp, first found disciplinary potential, but formal studies show that it has little benefit than sought to prevent death.
In contrast to PALM, ZMapp serves as a control, meaning that scientists use it as a basis and compare three different treatments.

Not only does it confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal is chestnut-brown and has a striped or colored carotenoid on the upper side.
The findings also provide insights into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers, called rachis, lacked well-developed shafts, but feather-like designs  barbs and barbels  have led researchers to speculate that the rachis was probably a strange evolutionary development of these other markings.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for regulation or temperature display. The researchers suggest that, although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shown showed adult feathers and not a calf.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was written to copy observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the coupon is to be caused by large waves between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon struggles to erode the land causing the flooding, so the Milky Way uses the force of the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in much the same way as regular matter.
This theory says that the darkest matter is because it is surrounded by a galaxy that looks like a crown, and it is made up of many tiny particles.

In France, voting is a commonplace and unfashionable experience: voters set aside a booth, place a printed sheet of paper showing their chosen candidate in an envelope.
Once the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope from the ballot box and signs the ballot roll.

Candidates can send representatives to see every aspect of the process. In the evening, count the votes of volunteers under strict supervision, and follow specific procedures.

He is in custody awaiting a deposition, but any evidence the witness may have may be tarnished because his good reputation has been made public.
This is common practice throughout the UK but the Scottish justice system is different and the courts consider it potentially harmful to publish the photos.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee writes, "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous path and even more so if they are publishing pictures and other suspicions".
The Crown Office, which is the overall prosecution authority, was shown by the press that no further comment was to be made even up to the indictment.
The document, the leaker said, was about the border wall, which Palestine wanted to capture based on the borders before the 1967 Mideast War.
Other topics discussed in the program included the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuing military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement was signed while the PA agreed to leave the presence in just five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were closely monitored by the rangers, as well as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a joint effort between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Aiustralia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This was Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally-violent protests have been sparked by the failure to hold elections, some as far back as 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod malheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it is aware of 27 accidents involving gadgets.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded to Apple's call for a strike on the report as "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The emergency management office in the Northern Marianas said that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no sign of a Tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer abducted tourists from Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shocked the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many captives have survived and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six captives, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Soon, the photographers replaced the elderly woman because she needed to use a sink.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births during his free time.
His research showed that when the hormone is applied, it accelerates the maturation of the breast lung.
Xinhuan reported that government investigators seized two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by his fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died overnight two months ago. She was as extraordinary as she was. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as green as I am...maybe more...I love her and miss her...she's in a better place".
Out of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 national election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose to 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard admitted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should have become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of voters shared this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the election, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games relays, but her complaints made her fitness questionable.
He could no longer take the medication needed to treat the pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Many people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
There is a possibility that comets are the source of the water supply to the world along with the organic matter that forms proteins and sustains life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, since comets hit the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year by signing a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He pointed to rumors that were "political talk and nonsense".
It was predicted that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to track aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation was provided and trains also did not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities were not available as of the time.
Fears of a lack of transportation have increased the possibility that the game will be forced to be held in a private area without the team's supporters.
The study published Thursday in the journal Science reports information on new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species change in just two generations, although this process is thought to be much longer, due to a mutation between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Of gold, it may be made into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any form, or into any thing.
It can be cut into thin wires, which can be turned and cut, and can be hammered or rolled with pliers.
It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "decorative manuscripts".
You can make a marker with the juice of red cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Spin two dry powders and then, with clean, wet hands, wrap them in a ball shape.
The wetness of your hands has a reaction with the outer layers, which feel dull and form a fringe-like shape.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have toilets with toilet facilities in almost every home, and they are equipped with a modern sewer system.
Remaining sewage systems are found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, baths were also common, and in Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of a public bathhouse where men and women mixed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and then sends it back down, almost instantly.
Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere bends some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to place the satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It provides us with trains, automobiles, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the more moderate-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and one.
Finally, there are many small cats (including the surviving domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, rats, ticks, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special job held by each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride is made up of one or three adult male clans, with about thirty females and cubs.
The women were usually closely related to each other, as a large family of sisters, and daughters.
Lion packs act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but no different from big cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very), swim, jump long distances and move at five times the speed of a strong man.
The tiger is a member of the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not the same as the full roar of the lion, but it is similar to the speech of angry and shouting words.
The ocelot prefers small animals, and it preys on monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds - almost all the animals it preys on.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and hunt for prey by smell, sniffing where they come from in the soil.
And their eyes are bright with their night-vision, and they are swift in their movement; and the ostrichs, when they are in the midst of the roaring, they catch the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is removed from the main population from which they came (for example if they move to a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't return quickly) they often find themselves in a different environment than where they came from.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different attitudes or adaptations to be more competitive than what they need in the sauna.
The original population remained unchanged, still requiring the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, their appearance gradually differs from that of other populations.
In time, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take out the carbon-dioxide that humans pollute (in other words, breathe out).
Plants obtain their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, we eat most of the food from plants, and without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the tallest predator of its time, so it was not afraid, apart from other dinosaurs.
Its long cheek is filled with 70 sharp teeth, with an extra set at the top of its mouth, indicating that no one can escape from it.
His diet included lobsters, large fish, and other mammals, and he could have been a cannibal.
They attack anything that enters the water; the large dinosaur T. rex is a no-muzzle.
While most of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had a share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a species of rat called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman had eaten their meals while sitting on the benches, the rich men preferred to feast together, where they would rest on their sides while they ate.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a major temple for each of their lords, which they recognized as the lord's house.
The people bring sacrifices to the god and the priests try to attend to the requirements of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Typically, the towers are of a special pyramidal shape, called ziggurats, since they were originally built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a home is not of great importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outside.
The women of the country have prepared their bread; they have opened their tents in the street; the stones of the house are in the stone-work.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely inhabited. In Norse stories, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on further travel westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But no matter what he found, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
After watching the movie National Treasure, you may think of the treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a written description on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th 1776". The words are located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While it is not known who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large document paper (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was stored for safekeeping.
Thus, it is highly likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
This was because it was ruled by "Vichy" French, the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also describes the size of society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture is one that promotes knowledge passed down through several generations, emphasizing heritage and equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first created a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to impose taxes, and, since it has no national executive or judicial branch, it relies on state authorities, often helpless, to enforce all its acts.
He had no authority to override the tax and tariff laws of the states.
The Articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended and the states never took the central government seriously because most of their representatives did not attend.
Italy national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Cup champions in the year 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the regions, so Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has some 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up Japan, it is often called an "island" on a geographical basis.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began to reform the way the aboriginal grain industry was run and employed Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been restored to give tourists a good idea of how the sauna is actually made.
A common example of harsh/hard light is the midday sun at the peak of a clear day.
For example, the world's most common still image format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size after the analogue film era.
It is still in production, but more importantly it has an aspect ratio that is more in line with digital camera image sensor formats.
Actually, the 35 millimetre format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 millimetres wide and 24 millimetres long.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many of the common formats (APS family of formats, for example) have the same or close to this aspect ratio.
The most triumphant and often derided laws of thirds are the simple guidelines for making enthusiasm while maintaining the balance of image order.
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
The power to subdue was so great that it affected everyone from the king down to the common man.
One of the basic Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are there for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this centralization of power and money had led many to question the validity of this teaching.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to blockade German waters.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this cutting off violated the accepted majority of international law codified in a number of international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the seas, and this posed a danger to even neutral shipping.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected the same response to its unstoppable submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the dominant attitude of the common citizen and the nation was that of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of war during World War I, the nations sought to prevent a similar situation from occurring again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla was transferred to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York city.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his first supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of its history; each period of China or each dynasty in power was a different dynasty.
The Three Kingdoms period was a period of uncertainty between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times a fierce war took place between the many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China when thousands of people died fighting to occupy the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
Many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
And again after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military because instead of rank being based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also encouraged many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things above this world. He often went to a cave known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides the clearest picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
Perched high on a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if one knows it exists.
Nothing but a clear, beautiful sky and many mountains around it. Very little is seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still stands.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, was one of many large pyramidal structures built for the dedication of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains many pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the famous Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in dedication to Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in dedication to Khufu's wives and family members.
An up bow is a V-shaped sign and a down bow is a cluster or a square with one missing from the bottom.
Up means that you should start at the tip and draw the bow, and down means that you should start at the tip called the frog (where your hand grabs the bow) and draw the bow.
The up-bow usually produces a lower pitch, while the down-bow is more powerful and aggressive.
You may well set your own marks, but remember that the bowing marks printed there have a musical purpose, so they should be respected.
The feared King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a gang of female merchants.
On the stage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
A mob forced the King and Queen to open the carriage window.
On one occasion, a member of the rioters brazenly beheaded a royal guard who was executed at Versailles in the presence of the frightened Queen.
The Filipino people have paid the cost of the war for the US imperialism in its occupation of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to fund much of the expense and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits made from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people may constitute the basic victories of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the formation of the group.
The period in which the events occurred is often called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many kinds of training ideas, from technology-push or technological necessity to the absolute understanding that human destiny is driven by compelling logic accompanied by the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path far beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, and not conditioned by society.
For example, one might argue that a motor car will inevitably result in a lot of traffic.
However, the nationwide carriage system is not economically feasible for just a few vehicles, so new manufacturing techniques are available to reduce the cost of ownership.
The increased ownership of automobiles has led to a high number of road accidents, which has led to the invention of new techniques for repairing injured human bodies.
Romanticism played a large part in cultural determinism, drawing on writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped each individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, in keeping with the social environment, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
While Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It became famous as an epicenter of luxury that began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what was offered in Byzantine markets.
This time the title of Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was popular in the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, with slow communication channels, western styles can take 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest breakthroughs of the time as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close the garment.
Livelihood agriculture is an agriculture that is carried on for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Livelihood farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses stored seeds found in the ecological region and combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers worked as subsistence farmers and this is still the case in many developing lands.
The subculture gathers like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by societal norms and leaves them to create their own identity.
Subcultures can vary greatly based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define subcultures as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often have a mark of their membership by a distinctive and identifiable use of style such as fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of companionship is to take some tragic cases of children who were abandoned, involved in a disaster, or deliberately abused, without adult companionship as they grew up.
Some children are abandoned by humans (usually their parents); in other cases, this is abandonment because of serious physical and mental impairment.
It is possible that abandoned children experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some of the animals are said to have been raised in a cage; others are said to have lived in the forest on their own.
When a child is raised perfectly in animals, this wild child will display behaviors (with physical limitations) that are almost identical to those of the particular animal that cares for him, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding is more than that.
Scaffolding is not a method of studying but an aid that supports individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffold as well as the little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are included in the software and are designed to ask questions, speed up and explain techniques that might be very challenging for a student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a variety of reasons including abandonment, abuse, and even neglect.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educating, but there are others.
We felt that the Care and Rearing System was a safe place for these children.
Our nursing system is what is expected to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, solid education, and reliable health care.
The orphanage was supposed to provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they had been taken.
The Internet combines two elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and methods of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "social" have been suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal appearance" and "ongoing relationships" were also recognized as new aspects of their enthusiasm by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined visitor reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has resulted in important discoveries in the interpretation of tiny expressions, facial movements that last only a few seconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly counting small statements.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks reveals that even people who cannot understand speech because of their brain damage can estimate accurate sincerity.
He further suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and revealed.
The mutation creates new genetic variation, and selection pulls it out of the pool at different points.
Segregation and reassembly of the various shuffles back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a monkey with a digestive system similar to that of a human to satisfy its amino-acid needs from its host plants.
Furthermore, if this is not done, there are dangerous consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant to eat is protein from plant leaves and seeds, but it is difficult for us primates to digest unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, ants, eggs) not only digest easily but also provide a high amount of protein that contains all the amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in seemingly the same way that savannas do today.
Sleep apnea is the process of waking up during your normal sleep and falling back asleep soon after (10-60 minutes).
It is easy to do this by using a silent alarm clock to bring you back to your senses when you are not fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting your sleeping clock, it can be placed in the other side of the room to force you out of bed to turn it on.
Other options based on the bayoritm involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, known to boost urination) before bedtime, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person acquires is inversely related to the amount of tension a person has in body and spirit.
Less stress, more positive life-styles than exist today.
The only obstacle to reaching this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is enriched by the path of love of the mahayana and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is comprised of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love towards all.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (light energy) is activated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and meditation.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By observing the various gods the energy pathways are purified, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which resulted in the cooperation of the USSR and the USA.
Two years after the war, the former ally is now an enemy and the Cold War has begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and would have to be fought in real proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defences were broken, and the only hope left was to retreat and reorganize on the Romanian base.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union advanced and made battlefields in Belarus and Ukraine after occupying the eastern region of Poland in defiance of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the seas.
The task of the navies is usually to ensure that your country retains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, hampering the ability of the enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most prominent recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which used U-boats primarily, sought to block this passage.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Britain might have been taken over by Germany as it had been taken over by the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes have begun to care for it for its quick extraction of milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Since goats are usually kept in groups and graze in hills or other pastures, they are often cared for by goat herders, often children or young people, like the more famous shepherds.
Chariots have been made in England since the 16th Century.
Although the carriages were made of the same wooden planks, they helped the horses they rode to run faster and carry heavier loads on the somewhat more difficult roads of the day.
Crossties were introduced to cover the track in the area, but it was gradually realized that they were better with a metal top.
This was common practice, but the iron caused further damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, which began two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their successor, Australopithecus, did not walk straight as usual.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some areas.
However, if we are not looking for a temporary solution, then we need to find the root cause of the problem, and we need to take action.
Clearly, the world has been greatly altered by human scientific and technological advances, and problems have been compounded by overpopulation and a luxurious life-style.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft of the treaty was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was immediately sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made of the entire gabie, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time on the grounds of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, where it was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
And 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many modern paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today - the ones we call birds.
Many people do not view them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them similar to a dinosaur.
They have long legs with claws, lay eggs, and walk with their two legs behind them like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, say 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits, to use a technical computer term.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that immediate treatment is not possible.
The best indication of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label on specific first-aid instructions for a specific toxin.
The word bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient practice of Bed-bugs, which are insects that adapt to become parasites on humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or dwelling place of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop Multiple Sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their prospective child.
In an adoption, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that the opposite spouse becomes the parent of the child.
The primary goal of Science is to observe how the world works by means of the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
Rather than being a stand-alone experiment, and an experiment being a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, scientific research is also guided by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
The accepted views on all things scientific, including psychology, are those of Aristotle.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found that it no longer adhered to philosophical and scientific roots in Greek.
Many observed rhythms of physiology and behavior are sometimes crucial depending on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, are evident in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-acting spinners that continue their free-running rotation even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was a major suggestion that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that marked either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in the germ-line cell can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in the other direction can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery including flora and fauna.
Examples of indoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orphanages of Borneo.
Every morning, people in small towns drive to their workplace and pass by others whose destination is work rather than where they came from.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected to, and supports, the private vehicle-based transportation system.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy is removing the biosphere from one of the stable conditions that supported human evolution two million years ago.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developing lands, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems receive such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic Running is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because one cannot be sure of one hundred percent of the driver's behavior.
Fortunately, drivers drive at a reasonable speed; thus, traffic flows have a proper consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, a relationship is shown between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid predators and was also their primary means of obtaining food and thus finding mates more quickly.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backward along the body.
This gives them more variety to avoid predators.
Today, the insects that cannot move their wings are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the sun.
Some people think he is right but many people also believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the World does not seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The widest river in the world is the Amazon, sometimes six times as wide as a mile.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows down the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of tributaries.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were by no means surpassed in their size and technical quality of construction.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were once over a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used in everyday life by ordinary state employees while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
Almost all the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in indigenous forms and are relatively easy to mine with the oldest tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
It is like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he considered them to be changeable and to form new substances to form what we see.
In fact, alloys are mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
You can also make alloys with small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny molecules called atoms.
Atoms so small that trillions of them could hit the point at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Sadly, as newer writing techniques have developed, the pencil has been reduced to a smaller form and to smaller tools.
With today's computer screens, people no longer need to use a scraper.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to build a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill, splitting the nucleus upward releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have moving nuclei that mean they are prone to break up with little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick at the near end and 60 miles [100 km] thick at the far end.
It is thinner below the sea and denser below the mountains.
There may be more lava nearby because the crust is thinner and the lava rises to the surface more quickly.
Content theories focus on finding out what people like or like.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/ or desires that come into their lives as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what is in certain people that causes them to do what they want and what factors in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Simply put, two attitudes emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One type is trying to remain "one of the men" (or women).
Such a manager has difficulty making decisions that anger people, taking disciplinary action, evaluating the worker's performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable for mistakes.
On the other hand, one becomes an unknown individual who feels the need to change everything the team does and do it for them.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior results in misunderstandings between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of competence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual group often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a conventional group because their group can meet according to different time zones that may be unintelligible to their local manager.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team where each member reports. The invisible team is the one that sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One goal for practical organization of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When resources are used effectively in the functioning departments of an organization, creativity and intelligence flourish.
As a result, an organizational process that works together to overcome a hurdle can lead to a new creative process of serving customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating thought.
The link between mental illness and behavior is a supporting factor for scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, including trauma, injury, and tumor, can affect behavior and alter the way the brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has a lot of science fiction connotations, it forms an important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation to a machine.
AI research involves designing machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer requests and questions, even recognizing facial expressions, voice, and touch.
These things have become diverse fields, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now being used extensively in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as are many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom, and often the teacher likes to take his students to places where travel by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual field trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their classes.
Virtual sharing of the field trip is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capitol, which is updated annually, but older versions are sold online as scrapbooks.
While students often start their blogging experience with a blurring of grammar and spelling, this often changes when there is a reader's presence.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer tries to keep the writing beautiful to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be aware of the world around them". The need to fill the audience's interest encourages students to be curious and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning experience beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "helps students to be discoverable and researchable; by actively responding to internet materials, students can determine their position in the context of others' goals and to align their views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful bilingual capital and is home to art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the far south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the natural beauty of Muskoka and others.
These things and more, make Ontario the most perfect example of Canada in terms of outsiders.
The large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated and some almost deserted.
For a comparison of the population that shocks many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Today, Madagascar is the largest, and a continent of its own in the wild.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, with a profound impact on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism followed in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama sighted the Cape Route from Europe to India.
West Africa is bordered on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (just don't look too hot) can also help.
Women should understand that cultural differences may result in what they call bullying and common following, arm-twisting, and so forth.
Be firm in your refusal to be with men, and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, this is not good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the Moroccan sultan and was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping areas in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pots, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole line of geegaws, but all of these are for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma would require research to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the Nyiragongo volcano climb along with some of the westernmost Mountain Gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short distance ride.
Along with its difficulty of access, "Timbuktu" has become a buzzword in foreign and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand dunes.
It was one of the highlights during the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is markedly different from other cities in the country, as it has more Arabic than African talent.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is recognized as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
In all South African National Parks, there are fees for daily maintenance and park admission.
It may also be beneficial for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which gives entry to any of the parks in South Africa or to all the parks in the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is where the territory of Hong Kong gets its name and is the place most tourists recognize as the most important.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is like a glittering bar chart made even clearer by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
Most of the urban developments on Hong Kong Island are filled with reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the area claimed by the British colonists and if you are looking for evidence of the history of this area, it is not a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastline in the world, stretching 80km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and rural India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
The forest is not just a series of valleys but  includes the remnants of the beautiful forests that make up the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, one of the three largest wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 have been found in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (from the river) throughout the day, especially those heading east to Jakar/Bumthanh as they leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are often full, people are advised to buy a ticket a few days before boarding.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, and these are both comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby areas, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The twin towers are 83 meters (279 feet) high, 378 meters (1,210 feet) long, and have two lanes each 3.50 meters [3.50 feet] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important group of indigenous people living today in Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also farmed.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, then called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
From the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay found a way to continue their evolving character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is the equivalent of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted on most of the island and inside Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also generally accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it spends summer there and winters in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the tropics; during the summer months, temperatures are usually in the +30°C range.
Wine can be deceptively cold: temperatures can sometimes drop below freezing, but the mixture of air and moisture can feel colder than the result of a thermometer.
There are no specific "rainy" and "summer" seasons: the rainfall will remain almost constant throughout the year.
While many of the park animals are accustomed to seeing people, the forest animals are wild and cannot be disturbed.
Park officials say, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards [25 m] away from all wildlife!
No matter how friendly they may seem, bison, big bears, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the proper distance.
In addition, you should be aware that the smell of bears and other wild animals can attract, so you should avoid bringing or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous naval encounter in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British ship was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is located between two ports, there are many beaches, the most popular being the three in the area.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by the poutuqua trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods of Central Auckland.
Sometimes crowded, these family seas with a good array of shops line the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer, but a satisfying and invigorating one.
Many French wines are far reaching, but New Zealand and Australian wines are probably even farther away.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is new - short black for espresso, cappuccino for cream, and tea for unpasteurized tea.
Hot chocolate is by Belgian standards, and fruit juices are equally expensive but delicious.
Many shark attacks occur throughout the year, and casualties from any of these causes are rare.
You still need to accept advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The banks near the headwaters of the river were cleared from October to April in the northern part of the 1770's.
There are lizards, but they rarely attack humans.
Since the Great White Shark is not an active marine resident, its primary habitat is the headwaters north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but you may find it possible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also increase the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer, or they may take other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
But any changes or requests should be made first through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp out on site, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the event you should arrive early to get a seat on the stage near the music.
It should be noted that even if the main stage is closed, there may still be some tours in other parts of the festival until late at night.
The festival is notable because there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, since the passage of ice causes the most terrible noise for the most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include city time. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos often try to save time and money that visitors spend. Windows and clocks are often missing, and the exit can be difficult to find.
They often have special foods, drinks, and entertainment to keep visitors entertained and to keep them in their place.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness can impair judgment, and all who are avid gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain trails must consider the possibility of snow, ice, and cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is very low and you cannot drive as you would on exposed asphalt.
During a snowstorm, it is possible to lose enough snow in a very short time that you can cover it.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or falling snow or by steam or ice on the windows of the car.
On the other hand, in many lands, ice and snow conditions are normal, and traffic is generally unhindered year-round.
Safari trips are perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari in common usage refers to a land trip to see the amazing wildlife of Africa,
Several animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are likely to approach the vehicles, and common equipment can provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them more often when using larvae.
A safari walk (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "hiking") involves walking, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations in 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but this was only at the end of March, most of the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that event tickets will be between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the typical ticket price at ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a washbasin that can be used outside the room.
If a plunger is not available, or if you do not like wearing plunged stockings, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the clothing (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are many methods of water purification, more effective against specific threats.
In some places, a minute of boiling water is enough, in others it takes a few minutes.
The effectiveness of the remedies varies, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your own sealed bottled water from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not related to their regions of origin.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are not generally accepted as pests.
Duty-free shops are opportunities to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Sometimes travelers go to countries with high taxes because they can save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The distance from Point Marion to Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often follows a remote forested path.
If you are not used to driving on a rural road, stay alert: many steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
The speed limits set for the track are found to be lower than in previous and subsequent sections  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is more important than otherwise.
Surprisingly, though, mobile phone service is actually faster here than anywhere else on this route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are quite plentiful and varied, similar to their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, as apples are cooked in pastry throughout the year, and plums are available in the summer.
German baking contains almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree seeds, and the popular cakes are often paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you prefer a small but tasty pastry, try what is regionally known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from spices and herbs, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the continent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 island options, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without an additional qualifier, the term kay seems to imply that the dish originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely used today throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of simple dishes, the dominant spice favored by the Javanese being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially sugar from Javanese cucumbers), and other spices.
The steps support the legs of the spider that hang on either side of the frame.
They provide more stability for the rider but may have safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to be trapped by them.
If the rider falls off the horse but the legs are in a state of tears, they may be pulled away when the horse runs away. To reduce this danger, many safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear high-heeled boots, which are smooth and have a slightly narrow heel.
Next, some mounts, especially English mounts, have safety irons that allow the leather stirrup to fall off the mount when turned back on the fallen rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, also called Yosemite in South America, for its various cliffs and walls.
The summit includes views that are breathtaking from the top of the mountain. Climbers from all over the world keep building new routes through the never-ending walls.
Snow-climbing sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating on snow-covered ground with a ski or snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is as old as cave paintings that depict skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
Low-skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club in 1861.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to but not usually associated with alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on a narrow path and requiring tighter skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In fine weather you can cover long distances rather than walk - but you rarely get the speed of cross country skiing without a backpack on the fine tracks.
Swimming and water-related activities can be hazardous.
In this respect, we are more like the Schengen zone because it functions as a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can, in general, cross borders without having to re-pass passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply separately for a visa in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
