Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about being on the Muppet Show
Some Members of the National Assembly objected to the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The riot broke out after the National Assembly was renamed the Welsh Parliament.
Now, representatives from different political backgrounds are all concerned that the new title could make them the object of ridicule.
One Labour MP said his faction was concerned that their new name would be rhymeised to Twp and Pwp.
Not for the benefit of our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp stands for monogamous and pwp for cock.
A Plaid Party spokesman said the whole faction was dissatisfied and therefore proposed alternatives.
One Conservative MP said his faction was open to the name change, but noted that the MWP was only a leap from the Muppet.
It is worth noting that the Welsh letter w is pronounced in a similar way to the Yorkshire English u, i.e. MWP pronounced map.
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law introducing the change of name is as follows: The final decision on the titles of members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members.
The 2017 Act governing the governance of Wales allowed the National Assembly to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation which proposed the inclusion of the Welsh Parliament and which received wide support.
As regards the title of Members of Parliament, the Commission prefers the title of Welsh Parliament Member and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation has supported the alternative to MWP.
The House has come up with more and more alternatives, but the deal is rather difficult, causing problems for the Speaker of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who is due to submit a name change bill in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly in other areas, including the disqualification of deputies and the structure of the committees.
The members of the House of Representatives will be able to cast their final vote on their own address during the debate of the draft law.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum aims to bring an end to a decades-long debate with Greece, a neighbouring country also known as Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed to support a territorial claim on its northern neighbour's name and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia is opposed to the referendum on the name change and is therefore not taking part.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a compromise that they must make for their EU and NATO membership.
The churches of Harlem are in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin are silent
"Once upon a time, as I hear from the elders, there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams claims.
 None of them are now.
Like you said, the bar disappearance would be understandable.
"People are getting together differently these days", he says.
 Bars are no longer the community living rooms where people go every day.
As for the churches, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not replace the leaders' hopes that they will eventually be back where they started.
And the churches will be replaced by buildings whose communities will not help the fate of the remaining churches.
The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white  claims , which will further hasten the permanent closure of churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these buildings will join the community.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a city of blacks, the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out of the church in the 1930s,
It was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson. The Rev. is known for his boycott drive on Harlem's Shopping Mall, 125th Street, against business owners who refuse to employ blacks or sell black products.
In 1939, a fire caused extensive damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell tower was built to the order of the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and also successor to St. Martin's Parish, proudly referred to the game as "The Bells of the Poor".
In July, an expert on the trumpet said that the instrument was a cultural heritage, an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell tower to be sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was invited to a major bell tower in a Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's never hired anyone to take his place.
In St. Martin's, a complicated situation has unfolded in recent months involving architects and contractors, who have been partly influenced by the secular leadership of the church and partly by the office of the bishop.
The parish's governing body, the Diocesan Council, in July wrote to the office of the bishop, protesting that the office would "repay the costs" to the council, even though the council did not participate in the selection of architects and contractors contracted by the office.
Some members of the congregation complain of a lack of transparency in the office building.
A shark attacked a 13-year-old California boy while fishing for crabs.
Official reports say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while fishing for cancer on the opening day of the cancer season in California on Saturday.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. on the Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he noticed a boy screaming for help and then he went out with a bunch of himself to help him get out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he noticed the boy shouting, "You bit me!"
He bit me!
His shoulder was torn at his keybone, and Hammel wrote down what he saw when he reached the boy.
I began to cry out, "Come out of the water!" And he added, "There's a crab in the water".
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As rescue captain Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, sharks had been spotted in the area, but they were then determined to be a non-human species.
Captain Giles also said the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities have closed the beach between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours during the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles says that more than 135 species of sharks occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would expand into the British beauty market
He'd be competing with Sainsbury's expert salesmen and department store-style piperestands from Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its continued growth in the £2.8 billion UK beauty market amid falling sales of fashion and household goods, the chain is testing larger piperestands in 11 stores across the country and will launch them in more stores next year if successful.
The pipeline is being strengthened by the fact that shops are trying to fill shelf areas previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household items in various ways.
Sainsbury's said it's doubling its offer to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it's offering for the first time.
But the previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also be located in larger areas at branded stands like Boots and similar stores.
The chain is also rebooting the Boutique make-up family, where most products are now vegan, as more and more young shoppers are looking for them.
In addition, the fragrance shop is also testing its appearance at two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the other is opening this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the proliferation of online shopping and the shift of food shopping habits to small local shops, large shops need to make greater efforts to trick customers.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the supply will increasingly resemble mixed retail as the chain tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and products other than food.
Since the two chains were acquired two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and several Habitat stores. This move has also had a positive impact on food stores, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The chain's previous attempt to curl up beauty and pharmaceutical departments has failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Bootss in the early 2000s, but this was ended by an outbreak of disputes over the revenue distribution of its pharmacy departments.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business at its 281 stores three years ago for £125 million to Celesión, the Lloyds chain.
The chain says Lloyds will be a key player in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury leather goods in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Sainsbury's commercial director, Paul Mills-Hicks, said, "We want to make our pipeline more comfortable by transforming the look of our pipeline.
We also hired skilled staff to provide counsel to interested ones.
Our brand offer meets every need, and the attractive environment and convenient location provide a compelling force that takes the shopping experience to a new level.
Peter Jones is down after Holly Willoughby pulled out of the £11 million deal.
Dragons star Peter Jones has left the show in a nutshell after television presenter Holly Willoughby quit her 11 million dollar deal with her lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly brand of homewear and accessories.
The two celebrity businesses have been compared to the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old anchor of This Morning announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has been deeply involved with Dragons' star Peter Jones when he left their promising lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was devastated when the TV host announced at a tense meeting at the Jones business estate's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that he was running out of time to dedicate his new £1.5 million contract to their homewear and accessories joint brand Truly.
The two celebrity businesses were compared to the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the island for one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, "Truly was by far the most important thing to Holly.
He was supposed to be working on this for the long term, and that's what's going to make his living for the next few decades.
The fact that he left was a complete surprise to everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, as the start was so close.
The warehouse in the Marlow office is full of items for sale.
Experts say the departure of This Morning's host, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of dollars, thanks to the massive investment and possible slippages in the range of pillows and candles to clothing and home wear.
And it can also mean the end of an old friendship.
The host and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby Capp launched Truly back in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over as president in March.
The two couples spend the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the production partner of M&S and take Ant McPartlin's place as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented on the incident last night: "We don't want to comment on [Jones'] business affairs.
♪ We were so hard on ourselves ♪
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider unnecessary, and for making such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump let so much go?
Trump asked in a funny newscast voice.
I didn't let that happen.
As he noted, Kim would like to meet again after Trump welcomed the first hearing in Singapore in June as a major step toward nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean Representative Ri Jongho told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country sees no appropriate response from the United States to North Korea's early arms moves.
Instead,  said  that the United States would continue to maintain sanctions against the pressure exercise.
Trump said much more optimistic in a campaign speech.
Things are going great with North Korea, he said.
We were supposed to go to war with them.
Millions of people would have died there.
But now we're really good together.
As he said, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have put positive results in the prospect of completing missile tests, releasing hostages and returning American troops.
He also explained why he was talking about his relationship with Kim in such an unusual way.
"It's not hard to act like a president, but now there's not a crowd out there of tens of thousands trying to get in, only about two hundred of them standing in front of me", Trump said, pointing to the group in front of him.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia from tsunami and earthquake that devastated the island
Indonesia refused the help of international relief organizations even after the earthquake in Lombo.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be displaced, a national disaster was not reported, which would be a prerequisite for international aid.
In many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not need international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult  Sumbung said.
Save the Children Foundation is already working on a relief team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to participate in the rescue.
According to Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Indonesian authorities are currently evaluating the situation in Palui to see whether international aid organisations need to be involved.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country faces the destructive forces of nature with extreme unpreparedness.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, other coastal areas are not at all.
While there was a tsunami warning, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning system in Palub also contributed to the human-life disaster.
Even in the best of times, transportation between the Indonesian islands can be difficult.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but it has at least three days to reach the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has put the development of Indonesia's sluggish infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has not saved on road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits ahead of next year's elections.
The president also has to face the ongoing tensions in Indonesia as members of the Muslim majority have begun to adopt a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced by riots in which Christian and Muslim gangs attacked each other in the streets with razors, bows and arrows, and other heavy weapons.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scoring a huge equaliser against Chelsea
In the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea by scoring a goal in the 89th minute.
His team was on a 0-1 loss when Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir about 30 metres from the Chelsea gate.
First he put the ball to his left, then he kicked a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The gunshot went high above the 16th and landed in the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally got into the bed over the falling Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"I just wanted to get in a position because there's always someone like Shaq who's going to put the ball in front of me, so I tried to put myself in a position as best I could", Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, and I just took it off, and then I didn't think much and I shot him.
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after taking the lead with a goal from Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
He hit the ball to Mateo Kovačić in the blue with a corner, then managed to break through the middle and run to Liverpool's court.
Kovacic started after a quick shot and got the ball back in the middle.
Then he started Hazard with a beautiful turn to 16.
Hazard ran the defense and finally sent the ball to the remote corner at Liverpool gate with a left-handed shot, by Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo Arena on Wednesday afternoon at 3pm as the next venue for the Champions League group stage.
Chelsea will play Videoton on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in London in the UEFA Europa League.
There are 832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the local disaster protection agency reported on Sunday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake and the resulting 6 metres high waves of lava buried several people under the rubble on Friday, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The streets of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, are covered in ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man for the murder of a stabbed woman.
Police have launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman, stabbed, was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents in the area to report anyone who saw anything or died.
Superintendent Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in its early stages, however, this time I would like to ask anyone who has been in the John Street area of Birkenhead and may have seen or heard something to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whoever may have anything on board to contact us, as they may have information relevant to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman killed was a resident of lambheadi and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, the woman's friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body was recovered in the early morning hours.
The investigation is ongoing, and police are currently notifying the victim's family.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but police said no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, the man could not speak.
The residents of the building have just been informed that it may take more hours for them to re-enter the building.
One of the officers told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with her tears.
"This is terrible". He repeated.
At 2:00 p.m., two police minibuses were inside the cordon and another outside.
Several police officers inside the cordon were watching the block.
Anyone with any information should text @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers organization at 0800 555 111 without a name and refer to file 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest victim of the history rewrite revolt
The banishment of the statue may well be poetic justice because Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers, at the time, were destroying England's cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with Taliban enthusiasm.
But according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's proposal is "foolishness", an attempt to rewrite history.
According to John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, "It was inevitable that at some point in the current debate over the removal of the statues, the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of the Palace of Westminster would eventually become a target.
During the English Civil War, the destruction of the painting was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
So perhaps another Cromwell could be a victim of the actions of Thomas, his ascent of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive portrayal of Cromwell reflects the 19th-century view and is a historical figure that many still consider to be celebrated today.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph about this: "Cromwell is perhaps less today than he was at the end of the 19th century, but still many consider Parliament to be the protector against external pressure, which, in his case, was of course the monarchy.
Whether this picture is indeed accurate remains a matter of historical debate.
But what is certain is that this conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century had an impact on the future of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of this conflict.
And his achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembering.
A murderous pig wounded to death a Chinese farmer
Local media reports say a pig attacked and wounded a farmer to death in a market in southwestern China.
A man with the surname of Yuank was found covered in blood and beaten in a carcass near a pig market in Liupanshui, Kujcsou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a farm in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
The man and his nephew traveled from nearby Jünnan province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, her cousin found the man's body and discovered that the door of the neighbor's pig was open.
He said the mouth of the giant candy-pick in the pig was bloody.
The report says the expert investigation revealed that the 250-pound pig marsh was indeed the death of its owner.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and they were broken by a hammer", said a relative named only by his last name, Wuk, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras showed Yuan stepping into the pigs' cage at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's property.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent further harm while police were investigating the tracks at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for the man's death.
Although not often, there have been reports of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their farm in Massachusetts, causing life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales squeezed a farmer into his tractor until the man's wife failed to alert him.
After a Oregon farmer was bitten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that while pigs are generally not prone to attack, they can become aggressive because of their taste in blood.
They're very playful.
Like little children, very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them respect.
Heavy rainfall in the aftermath of Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it hits colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will continue to cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa, with winds of 140 km/h, was a Category 1 hurricane that hit the east coast at 5 a.m. on Sunday, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone forms over the Pacific Ocean and heads westward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, it is flooding the southwestern United States with heavy tropical moisture as a tropical storm.
The storm could bring up to 25 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the approaching low-pressure tropical storm, which will encounter low-pressure masses, will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Here, a 310 cm rainfall can cause flash floods, debris flooding, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rainfall can occasionally bring in up to 58 cm of rain per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest are expected to experience 510 cm of rainfall, particularly in Arizona.
Sudden flooding may occur, with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rainfall.
During the tropical rainy season, it is especially not recommended to walk in the desert.
Heavy rainfall can make canyons into buzzing rivers, and storm surges are sometimes accompanied by sudden winds and dust clouds.
Coming low-pressure masses could cause heavy rainfall on the coast of Southern California.
Even 1.5 cm of rainfall is possible, which can cause minor flooding with debris and flat road conditions.
This will be the first wet season in the region.
Tropical storms can hit Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and rainfall will spread to larger areas during daylight hours and on Tuesdays.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the Four Seasons region on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations will be observed in the United States as the polar atmospheres cool, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences at locations even over short distances.
A prime example of this is the situation in the central United States on Sunday.
Temperature variations between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, are nearly 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, even the summer heat is expected to be felt in larger areas.
The central and eastern United States is expected to be warm in the first half of October, with temperatures ranging from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of the Northwest between 25°C and 30°C.
New York's temperature will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts suggest that temperatures in the eastern United States will likely exceed average temperatures by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
Over 20 million viewers on six television networks have followed the testimony of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of rape in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political situation was not resolved, and the broadcasters had to cut off their regular programming due to last-minute Friday's mess: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was being held up and tried to strip her at a high school party.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The statements from the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen were likely seen by more viewers on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen has a hard time measuring the number of people watching shows at their workplace.
For comparison, you have so many fans at the football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, of all the channels that have cast experts supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, Fox News Channel had the highest viewership, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's audition.
ABC is in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was watched by 3.1 million, NBC by 2.94, MSNBC by 2.89, and CNN by 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest in the interview didn't go down.
The lead character in Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Senator Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS aired a Friday morning broadcast of loud crowds of protesters as they ascended the elevator to meet the Judiciary Committee.
He stood there for minutes, his eyes closed, while the crowd cheered, and CNN broadcast the scene live.
I'm standing here before you, a woman told the senator.
Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth to the public?
Others shouted at him, "You have the power to do what so many women do not.
All Flake said was that his office issued a statement and before the elevator door was closed, he added that he would share his statement at the committee hearing.
Cable and television broadcasts were then shown live hours later as the committee voted on whether to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote by the full Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only accept the offer if the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority have urged.
Flake was convinced of the need for this by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talks with the Coons and later with other senators.
Flake's decision was a good one, as it was obvious that without an investigation, Republicans would not have the votes they needed to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses anti-Brexit politicians of playing politics
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of playing a political game that would jeopardize the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the nation's interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, is arriving at the Conservative Party's Birmingham conference on 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the newspaper, directly following May's interview, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to handle each other's tariffs is utterly absurd.
The Wayde Sims murder: Police have found Dyteon Simpson, suspected of murdering an LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed 20-year-old Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested on suspicion of murder with a strong motive, Baton Rouge police said.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation and reported that Sims' glasses fell during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and Simpson's DNA was on it, and it was leaked to CBS's WAFB channel.
After Simpson was questioned, police reported that the young man confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the Advocate, the court has set the bail at $350,000.
According to a preliminary report released Friday by the East Baton Rouge County coroner's office, the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Bureau thanked the Louisiana State Police for their special task force dealing with escaped criminals, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the University Police Department and the surrounding community for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement for their hard work and dedication to uncovering the truth.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-inch forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player at LSU.
Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in his final season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the news of Sims' death shocked the team.
"You're always afraid of something like this", Wade said.
A volcano is flooding Mexico City with ash
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
After volcanic activity intensified in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash eruptions occurred within 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Prevention urged the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several tremors and tremors.
In the images on the community portals, in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilcó, car windshields are covered in a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of Mexico City after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's split-secession referendum.
A group of loyal separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the police who were holding them back, so the once tourist-crowded streets were now covered in dense powder.
Later that day, further clashes broke out, during which the police tried to maintain order with rubber bands.
The 'We do not forget, we do not forgive' slogan-scrambling pro-independence groups and the 'Life in Spain' slogan-scrambling pro-unity protesters faced each other for hours.
Local media reports said 14 people were arrested with minor injuries during the protests.
Tensions continue to rise in the region, which has been undergoing a series of independence struggles, following a referendum on October 1 that Madrid has declared illegal but which Catalan separatists have celebrated.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to split, although turnout was relatively low as most unionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to stop voting in polling stations in violent clashes.
Independence groups were on the streets all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
Although the demonstration was not stopped, it did not proceed in the right direction.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, says there is no longer a chance that Catalonia will gain its independence.
Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents throwing up their pleas for us to vote, but for now, our case is being shredded.
Although the regional elections in December last year were a significant, if narrow, victory, the Catalan independence parties have found it difficult to maintain momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders have been forced into voluntary exile or are awaiting a court ruling over their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a police protest on her phone, the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
The situation is getting more tense, he says.
Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
I can most strongly reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government is putting in place if I am to stand as a candidate in the European elections
Londonderry: Police arrest three men who drove their cars into a house
Police have arrested a 33-year-old, a 34-year-old and a 39-year-old man who drove their cars into a house in Londonderry on multiple occasions.
The incident occurred at about 7:30 p.m. local time at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point, the car was even hit with a machine gun.
With his Menga goal, Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga secured Livingston's victory with her first goal.
Newly promoted to the first division, Livingston surprised the Rangers by adding Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been coaching the club for 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal made the real difference, as Gary Holt's team went into a dead-end race with Hibernian's team in second place.
The Gerrards have thus continued to be undefeated in the Scottish League this season and will face the top-ranked Hearts side eight points behind on Sunday.
But before that, the Rangers will have a Europa League game on Thursday against Rapid Wien.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased their division record to six wins, meaning that Kenny Miller's last month's replacement Holt has yet to be released.
Livingston missed a number of positions against the inaccurate guest squad.
Holt's team could have taken the lead by the end of the game, with only one goal, as they've caused a lot of trouble for the Rangers with their offensive play.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but took the offense too far, and Alan Lithgow's attempt proved broad after he slipped to catch Craig Halkett's crossed ball in front of the goal line.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game, as they were sure they could disturb the guests in the fixed playing conditions.
The fateful goal was born from exactly this situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in the defense, creating a situation for Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who took advantage of that to cancel his mid-16s.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led the ball, but the home defense remained unbreakable and Liam Kelly's goal was barely in danger.
This trend continued through the second half of the game, except for one situation when Kelly had to defend against Alfredo Morelos.
Scott Pittman's attempt was foiled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed the gate by another free kick from Livingston.
The interceptions were continuously delivered to Livingston's 16th, but the defenders were dismissed each time, and the attacking team missed two penalties: one for Halkett's entry against Glenn Middleton as a substitute and the other for handling.
Fenomenal game from Livingston  match analysis
This is Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter from Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston performed phenomenally and he's been brewing the beans.
The players performed exceptionally well, one by one, and they exceeded expectations.
The team's members and playing style have changed little since they returned to the front line, but Holt's efforts are also highly regarded, as he has been a huge boost to the team since his arrival.
Several players have brought in their best form.
Captain Halkett formed a giant force with his highly organized defense, and Menga successfully defended Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played without a vision.
As well as they did at times under Gerrard, they were unable to achieve that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula  anyway they only managed to knock off their home defense  so the Rangers had to get back together quickly as they slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdoğan received a mixed reception in Cologne
The morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin on Saturday 29 September was characterized by a pleasant mood and goodwill.
This was the last day of Erdoğan's dividing visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO members.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated over issues related to human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdoğan then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built, huge mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks outside Turkey.
Police have banned 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters of the president have come to see the Turkish president.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdoğan protesters, including many Kurds, expressed dissatisfaction with Erdoğan's policies and the decision by the German government to accept the prime minister's offer.
The two opposing protests perfectly exemplify the divisive nature of the president's policies, which some German citizens of Turkish descent celebrate as a hero while others see as autocratic.
Road accident in Deptford: hit by a bicycle and killed
He lost a bicycle rider to a car crash in London.
The car crash happened at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the van stopped, and the evacuees tried to help the cyclist, who died on the spot.
The collision occurred just months after another cyclist was killed in a failed gas attack on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
According to a statement from the London Police, the officers are still working to identify the man so they can notify his family.
The investigation has led to road closures and bus delays making it difficult to get around, and authorities are advising drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in riots in a strictly guarded man's prison, the prison administration said.
The riots began at 9:30am on Sunday morning at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire and have so far been uncontrolled.
To deal with the situation, authorities have sent a special unit called the Tornado to the scene, where eight prisoners are involved in the riots, who have been confined to a building wing.
Special Forces members suffered only minor head injuries that were treated at the scene.
Statement by a spokesperson for the Penal Enforcement Agency: Specialised prison guards are handling the situation at Long Lartin.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, and those responsible will be turned over to the police and face additional prison sentences.
Long Lartin men's prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, reports said the prison director had to be hospitalized after one of the inmates attacked him.
Last October, too, the special forces were needed to quell a major riot in which prisoners attacked prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although drought-affected areas may be in better condition)
Arizona is seldom hit by tropical depressions, but it is expected to be the state's first hurricane to hit early next week, when the remnants of the Rosa hurricane will sweep through the deserted southwest, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already ordered flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, as well as southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is projected to make its way straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night, bringing heavy rain.
The Phoenix Meteorological Service posted the following message on Twitter: "Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phonenix.
For example, Hurricane Katrina in 1967 brought the AES to its limit 40 miles away.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern desert (central areas of the Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) rainfall is expected to be 2550 mm, but in some places it may be as high as 100 mm.
The rain brought by Rosa can bring relief to areas not threatened by flash floods, as the area is currently experiencing severe drought.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rainfall can have a beneficial effect on the drought-stricken southwestern landscapes.
The US Drylands Monitoring Service reports that more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing minimal extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category  according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will make its first landfall on the Lower Peninsula of California, Mexico.
It will continue to be a hurricane, and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 137 km/h, it will move about 600 km south of the Punta Eugenia landmass in Mexico and travel north at approximately 19 km/h.
The storm will encounter cooler currents in the Pacific Ocean and lose its strength.
So the coast of Mexico is expected to be hit again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or late at night.
Heavy rainfall can be expected in some parts of Mexico, which significantly increases the chance of flooding.
An average of 70~150 mm of rainfall can occur from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, where it can drop to 250 mm locally   according to weather.com.
Rosa then moves north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday, in the form of a tropical depression, before making its way through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
The greatest threat posed by Rosa and her remains is expected to be extraordinary rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the desert areas of the southwestern United States, the National Hurricane Center said.
Rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flash flows and mudflow in desert areas and to prevent landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
On Saturday, local time, at 4:00 a.m., a wounded teenage boy was found in a suburb called Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was rushed to hospital, his condition is stable.
Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Radstock, Avon and Somerset in the middle of the night.
The authorities are asking the public if anyone has a cell phone record of what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from the anger and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh, votes against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to suffer the anger and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where she strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's claim that the man had sexually assaulted her as a teenager decades earlier.
Ford testified at the hearing and supported his earlier claims.
The president said Saturday that Americans could see for themselves that day Kavanaugh's brilliant and fearless character.
The vote for Judge Kavanaugh, voted for one of the most distinguished legal professionals of our time, who has an impeccable public service record, voted for Trump's supporters in West Virginia.
The president covered up Kavanaugh's candidacy, while discussing the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
It's only five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not going to run myself, but I'm actually going.
That's why I go everywhere to support the best candidates.
Trump argued that Democrats are using tactics of resistance and blockade.
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in a tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rising
Many were swept away by the storm, and at least 384 people lost their lives when the massive waves hit the coastline, a disaster caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in Palu for a festival on Friday when the nearly 20-foot [18-foot] waves hit the shore, sweeping many away, and destroying everything in their path.
The leak was triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the storm warning was issued yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, not fled immediately, and were victims of the waves", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a news conference in Jakarta.
"The storm didn't just come in, it brought cars, boats, houses and everything else along the coast", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling at 800 km/h in the open sea before reaching the shore.
Some climbed to the top of trees from the river and escaped, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters.
Aerial footage of the disaster released by the agency showed several buildings and businesses collapsing, several bridges twisting and collapsing, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further raids shook the coastal city.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of about 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), the earthquake on Friday released about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and the resulting geographical features could have reinforced the impact of the spring.
According to Nugroho, the damage was "significant", thousands of homes were destroyed, and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Several bodies were found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far is 540, and another 29 are being sought.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater in the area called Donggala, 300 km (190 miles) from Palut, as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is completely crippled, there is no information on Donggala, Nugroho said.
Over 300 000 people live there  The Red Cross announces that its specialists and volunteers are already on their way to the disaster area.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be even worse.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday for not informing the public about the fallout from the Palut, but the authorities said the waves had already reached the shore during the issuance of the alert.
One amateur video shared on social media shows a man trying to warn people on the street of the impending leakage from the top floor of a building with desperate screams.
Within minutes, a huge wall of water will hit the beach, dragging cars and buildings with it.
Reuters news agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and the storm caused power outages, rendering communication in the Palu area impossible, making it more difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has sent relief supplies in cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but authorities say the evacuated population will still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was opened only to facilitate relief work, and is closed until October for all other purposes.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up by Palun on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's team arrived safely from Donggala to Palu, where the staff found shelter under the tent poles in the office yard, but encountered signs of terrible destruction along the way, Doseba said.
They said they saw a lot of houses falling apart.
 It's very bad.
While the relief teams were preparing for disaster relief work, some complained that foreign professionals with extensive experience in the field could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, all overseas aid, relief supplies and personnel may be admitted to the territory of the country only if the site of the disaster is declared a disaster area at national level.
That hasn't happened before.
The case is still being treated as a provincial disaster  said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 Once the government acknowledges that it is indeed a national disaster, international aid services can be allowed in, but no announcement has been made so far.
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, please, the friends and family of the missing continued to hope that their loved ones will be among those whose miraculous survival smuggled some light into the dark atmosphere of the reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue operation, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, workers managed to rescue a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national rowing team, has trained two of the missing rowers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month and will be held in Indonesia.
Besides the missing, his other students were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
"As a screaming veteran, I was shocked by what had happened.
Gendon recalled that when news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse began to spread among the screamers, he spent hours desperately trying to reach the contestants who were attending the beach festival please on WhatsApp.
But instead of two blue pipes, only one grey pipe appeared next to the messages.
I guess that means the messages couldn't be delivered anymore.
$26,750 stolen while charging a bank account at the Newport on the Levee mall
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was just charging cash at an ATM in the Newport on the Levee mall, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the cash truck was just draining a ATM at the entertainment center and preparing to fill it with additional bank notes, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
A man approached a Brink's employee on Saturday while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared wallets.
Witnesses also saw several suspected perpetrators flee the scene, but the police statement does not list the exact number of suspects.
Anyone with information about the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Y
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye from now on.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known by many as Ye for some time, and his eighth album, released in June, was also called Ye.
She announced the name change ahead of her departure from Saturday Night Live, where she is also expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She's taking the place of Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for emotional reasons, the show's producer said.
The new name is not only a shortened version of the rapper's current stage name but also a religious one for West, according to previous revelations.
As far as I know, the word "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means that West mentioned it earlier when he was talking about the title of his album to Big Boy, the radio host.
So I am you and I am us and we are all one.
Kanye means the one, and that's what made him Ye, which is the good, the bad, the confused, everything that lives inside us.
The album is more about who we really are.
Ye's one of those famous rappers who changes their name preferably.
Sean Combs, for example, has run as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he would now prefer Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also varied several times on whether his name should be spelled in conjunction with a letter, perhaps in capital letters.
The Mexican president has vowed not to deploy the military against civilians
On the 50th anniversary of the bloody student protests, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico has pledged never to use force against civilians.
López Obrador on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square promised that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the area, killing about 300 people as left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young Mexicans by providing students with monthly financial aid and plans to establish additional free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education were the two main factors that were driving young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The US should double the funding framework for AI solutions
As China becomes more active in AI research and development, the United States should double its funding for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an AI-based solutions investor and employee who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He then said that the US government had made announcements about artificial intelligence, even though the US does not have an official intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its related plans: the country aims to become the world's leading AI developer by 2030.
'Doubling the cost of AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in AI is on the horizon,' Lee said.
Double research grants could double the chance of the United States taking the next big step in artificial intelligence, he told CNBC.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the best American Othello player, and later served as a member of the board of Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of previously announced technology competitions by the US government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and wondered when he would host the next such event, as it would open the door to exploring new future molding.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get the government funding they need for their research, Lee said.
China is not stealing the scientific leaders, it's stealing the big companies.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have also hired several big college heads over the past few years to work in the field of AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help greatly in the U.S.'s efforts to develop artificial intelligence.
I think you should automatically get a green card for those with a doctorate in artificial intelligence, he said.
The Chinese government announced in July 2017 its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China similarly supports academic staff as the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other governmental organizations provide funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the US Department of Defense has created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, a center for AI for working together by industry professionals and academics, and the White House has announced the establishment of a committee called the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
NSF is currently spending $100 million a year to support AI research.
Meanwhile, the United States legislature, which planned to create a national security intelligence committee, has not taken any further action for months.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that prevented the country from accepting its EU and NATO membership application.
Greece, which has one of its provinces called Macedonia, has argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it is claiming the Greek territory of the same name and has thus vetoed its membership of NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the new name of the state, but national sentimental opponents say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has declared that he will not participate in the referendum and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it has become doubtful whether he will have the 50% turnout required for a valid referendum.
The question on the ballot is: Do you support the country's membership of NATO and the EU and do you accept the agreement with Greece?
The name change's proponents, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order to give Macedonia, one of the countries that has emerged from the ruins of Yugoslavia, the opportunity to become a member of the EU and NATO.
'I came here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,' said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, a sufficient Member of Parliament has stated that he feels obliged to look at the outcome of the vote.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m. on the day of the vote.
However, the turnout so far has been only 16%, up from 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which was attended by 66% of registered voters).
"I came to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in Skopje, the capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted in favour of the name change in Strumica in a referendum on 30 September 2018 that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, chairs and tents for boycotting the referendum in front of the parliament building.
'We support the country's membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join with pride and a raised head, not through the maid's door,' Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonians, we can turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership could be expected to provide investments in Macedonia that are much needed by a country with unemployment above 20%.
I think the majority will support our cause, as more than 80% of the country's population basically supports EU and NATO membership said Zaev after casting his vote.
He also said that the vote would ensure the future of the country.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, 3043% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required turnout.
Another survey by Telma TV in Macedonia predicts a 57% turnout on Sunday.
Of those who want to go to the polls, 70% said they'd vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50% by more than one vote.
The invalidation of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western Party government that came to power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player scoring a goal with the full Brighton defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling thoroughly beat Brighton's defence, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero scored his goal in the 65th minute as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine fighter was given a pass in the middle as the first step of the attack, and
He escaped between the three Brighton guards and landed in the open.
Then four green forests surrounded Aguero.
He kicked a defender out, then ran even further, getting close to Brighton's 16.
Then he went left to the one that showed up.
The English fighter, already in his sixteenth year, forced the ball back to Aguerro, who finished the action with his right foot, by kicking the ball into the right side of Brighton's night guard, Mathew Ryan's gate.
"Aguerro has foot problems", Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, told reporters.
We agreed that you could play 55 minutes, 60 minutes at most.
And that's what happened.
Luckily, that's when he scored.
Sterling's action was enough to give the Blues an early lead in the English championship.
The goal came in the 29th minute, when
Aguero, who is on the Brighton's runway, has a great pass.
He's got a beautiful crossball going to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane played ball for a while before he started Sterling in the long jump.
In the Blue's fight, he could just kick the ball into the gate before it slipped out of the starting line.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, from 12:55 onwards.
Scherzer wants to make it harder for the Rockies.
Since the Nationals missed the postseason, there was no reason to really push.
But Scherzer, a always competitive spirit, looks forward to Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the team still has a chance to play.
The Rockies secured at least a comfortable spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still waiting for you.
Even though we don't have a chance, we can stand up to them by saying that the mood of the Denver public and the other team is expected to be at its peak this year.
Of course I'm in the mood to get on the field.
The Nationals have yet to pick a starter for Sunday, but the news is that in this situation, Scherzer will be the pitcher.
Scherzern, who took part in the practice of throwing on Thursday, will have his 34th starting pitch on Sunday, his usual day off.
The right-handed Washington player is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts this season after 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia
The president also covered up the situation surrounding the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the midterm elections.
In November, everything we've accomplished is at stake.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, the big ones, and I'm not running personally, but I'm actually running, which is why I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates, he said.
Trump continued: "Everyone can see what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing, they can see it with their own eyes.
They are determined and can use any means to regain power, there is evil and wickedness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they trample to get control, to have power, that's what they want, control and power, but we're not letting ourselves go.
The president says the Democrats are putting in the fight and the blockade.
"They've been doing this for the last four days", he said, "called the Democrats dirty and mean and mean and lying".
He mentioned by name Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, at whose hearing he expressed his strong disapproval of the crowd.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute. All this with very bad body language, it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
He doesn't tolerate people who express their opinions freely.
I was not surprised at all when Momentum activists in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I am just the last of a long line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome to see them simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way for her uncompromising opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor didn't like the fact that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
And yet, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are ironically the issues Jeremy also disagreed with his former leaders on.
The invitation to a Labour meeting in Nottingham East on Friday stated that they wanted a welcoming and productive meeting.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Party representative, these Friday night meetings were exactly like that.
But unfortunately, today the tone has changed and the promise of a more restrained, more polite policy has been forgotten, if it ever came true.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences in opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This trend started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the pair, and my colleagues, who I thought had a similar political attitude to us, have been increasingly expected lately to turn their backs on my personal views and take a stand on things that I would never agree with, whether it be on national security issues or the single European market.
After every public speech, no matter what I actually said, they start to mock me on social media, demand my removal, criticize my policy of pulling the middle, and tell me I shouldn't even be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know I'm happier than many of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my fellow politicians who are forced to face sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but never run.
The most outrageous aspect of our current policy is that attacks at this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the Labour Party's need to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have given up diversity and with every confidence-building initiative and every change in the electoral rules, the circle of people in the party is becoming narrower.
In recent years, many people have advised me to hold back, to be less talkative, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I entered politics.
32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Labour Party, outraged by the Thatcher government's neglect of schools so much that our classroom was almost in decline, and then I fought for better access to the most deprived as a local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and I have never done so in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was clear to everyone what my political views were and what issues I disagreed with the current leadership on.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I want to say that in this situation where the country is moving towards a Brexit that will not only hurt families but also companies and public services, I don't understand why you have to spend so much time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of change or political intent will deter me from acting in my own judgment and in the interests of all.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr Melrose 3817: Ayr is unstoppable at the top
Two late attempts have altered the outcome, but Ayr's deserved victory in the most entertaining match of the day, the Tennents Premiership, is beyond doubt.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
Thanks to their unparalleled defense and superior positioning, they've won, so the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
"We've had to face many challenges in our games so far, but we're still undefeated, so we have every reason to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, a Melrose player, said: "We must admit that Ayr has taken advantage of his situation much better than we have.
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which gave Frazier Climo a point, gave Ayr an advantage, and the yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes by the Warriors would have made Melrose a difference, but Jason Bagg's attempt did not.
Climo swept Ayr's defence with a penalty kick, just in the half, then scored on a one-man trial, so the first half ended 17-5 in Ayr's favour.
Melrose got off to a strong start in the second half, Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Bagg, cutting the team's deficit to five points.
The game was then put on hold for a long time as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to be taken off the field, and Ayr continued to increase their lead by trying to get Stafford McDowall, whose bears were knocked down with Climo's help.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, was given a yellow card, and then the Melrose managed to stop Bruce Colvine's experiment in a man-made manner, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started to get stuck again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for putting Climot down without a ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line behind Ayr's attacking team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after the reboot when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and forwarded Gregor Henry's cutter to the home crowd's fifth attempt.
The Still Game star has embarked on a new career in the hospitality industry
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is moving toward the hospitality industry, and it's been revealed that he's running a restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvist stars in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-stars with his longtime comedian Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the ninth season will be the final season, and it appears Kiernan is already planning his life beyond Craigsland.
According to official records, he became the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was trying to cash in on Glasgow's booming hospitality industry.
Bolivia, which has no coastline, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the sailing-painted naval command in La Paz.
There are ocean flags flying on the buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon proclaim the following motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back.
In a landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast that Chile took in a 19th-century resource-related bloody conflict is still alive and the desire to rediscover the waves of the Pacific is alive.
Perhaps the most powerful hope for decades is now that Bolivia awaits the October 1 ruling of the International Court of Justice, which will conclude its five-year session.
"Bolivia has a ball that floods people with a spirit of solidarity and peace, who are in a positive mood for the final outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivian observers are watching the International Court of Justice's ruling, hoping that the Hague tribunal will stand with Bolivia and that after decades of Chile's rapsodian stance, it will be compelled to sit at the negotiating table to ensure that Bolivia has independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, charismatic, indigenous president of Bolivia who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, could lose a lot in Monday's ruling.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, he said in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that would not change the situation much if the decision were still in favor of Bolivia.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no jurisdiction to rule on Chilean territory and has also stated in advance that it will not affect the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court's ruling came just six months after the final talks indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, an expert in Chilean international law.
And for the past four years, he's not only not helped Bolivia, he's even turned it down.
The current Bolivian government has turned the issue of maritime access to its own ends  developed by Zárate.
 Morales' hostile rhetoric has also led to the loss of the goodwill of the Chilean people.
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue negotiations at some point, but after what has happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the finding that the court decision would have been unusually quick.
He said Monday would provide Bolivia with a "reconcilable opportunity" to open a new chapter in relations with Chile and a chance for both countries to recover from a 139-year dispute.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the maritime debate to forge political advantage.
Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean.
 The judgment gives us an opportunity to see that it's time to move on from the past.
North Korea: No disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho says his country won't be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit of the leaders of the two rival countries in Singapore.
He made the comment when it seemed that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had managed to restart the stalled nuclear talks more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri said he's willing to believe that the ongoing sanctions and the US's declaration ending the Korean War will ever be enough to force North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of accepting the statement unless Phenjan takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Phenyan's commitment to dismantling the arsenic, which he is likely to see as the only key to his country's security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Phenian next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows have featured the huge headgear that will soon be featured in high-end stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headscarves as part of their 2019 Spring/Summer collection, which was met with enthusiasm by Parisian fashion-style audiences.
The unpratically-unstable hats made a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the fashion designers above also launched their high-profile works.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, decorated with a feathery, wide arm, almost completely absorbing the models' heads.
Other oversized supplements included jewel-encrusted Greek ornaments, a magic wand, and even an pineapple, which were not really designed to keep people's heads warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks had their mouths sewn together and reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than of haute couture.
One of these pieces resembled a diving mask, complemented by pipes and glasses, and the other looked like a melting sponge ice cream.
If you can get these spectacular pieces, you're in luck.
According to fashion analysts, the giant hats may be on their way to the top-notch clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path of the La Bomba, a 60-cm-wide straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski has seen.
A cult icon behind the unpretty hat, which has taken over social media, has introduced another piece to the runway: a beach bag made of straw that is almost the size of the bathing suit that holds it.
The dark orange raffle bags, decorated with raffle boxes and a white leather towel on top, were one of the highlights of the Jacquemus 2019 Spring/Summer La Riviera collection at the Paris Fashion Show.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see huge hats and beach bags in high-end clothing stores next summer, and the designer has had such an elementary effect on everyone that it would be hard to deny the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have traditionally provided excellent education, and this has not changed since 2018, despite recent excellent test results, which are only reinforced by individual and group successes in sports, the arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying in institutions of this type, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which aim to provide the best possible services to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
In an education sector where it is possible to design and implement tailored school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to someone in a language they understand, it reaches their head.
But if you speak his language, it will reach his heart.
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that students from independent schools across the country have been performing best in foreign languages.
68% of all students studying foreign languages have achieved a higher A-level (a score of over 85%).
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72% of students achieved a higher A-level in Mandarin, while 72% of German learners, 69% of French learners and 63% of Spanish learners achieved an A-level.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages as subjects of choice have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in both independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Committee on Employment and Vocational Training found that 17% of employers found that filling vacancies was difficult because of a lack of language skills.
This also shows that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to pursue successful careers.
As more and more people in the workplace expect to know foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of what career a person chooses, learning a foreign language will bring him a lifelong knowledge that will bring him clear benefits.
Being able to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically gives a competitive advantage to the multilingual applicant.
According to a YouGov survey of  4,000 adults in the UK in 2013,  75 percent of respondents were not fluent enough in any foreign language to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent of respondents (15 percent).
That is why it is important to focus on language education for children right now.
Speaking multiple languages, especially in developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children that, when they are educated, will give them a better chance of applying for more important jobs as adults.
In Scotland, every school will have different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of major importance to the UK by 2020.
Whatever the child's area of interest, the independent schools will offer a choice of languages and will train teachers who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and supplies them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is not difficult to see that in today's global business environment languages remain vital for a country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated more as international communication skills.
Independent schools offer Scotland's young people a choice of diverse and quality education.
It's got to be this way.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's playing in San Diego with the Lakers on Sunday.
Now, fans who are sitting on needles don't have to wait long to see LeBron James take the field for the first time in the colors of the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll be on the court is still a question.
"More than one and less than 48", Walton wrote on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
A few days ago, after training, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the preseason.
"At this point in my career, I don't have to play in the preseason to be ready".
Trump's campaign and YouTube channel in West Virginia
Donald Trump is starting a long line of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five Trump events announced next week, including stops like Tennessee and Mississippi that support him.
Now that the vote to confirm his nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat has been postponed, Trump is seeking to rally support for the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress when the vote is in November.
When does Trump start his West Virginia show tonight, and where can you follow him online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 PM Eastern time.
You can follow Trump's meeting in West Virginia online via YouTube.
Trump is likely to be affected by this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has proved particularly tense in light of sexual harassment allegations and has suspended the Senate confirmation vote for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary purpose of the sudden proliferation of events is to help the situation of Republicans ahead of the November election.
Trump's campaign adviser said five events next week will serve to activate voters and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and increase the majority they currently hold in the Senate and House, Reuters reports.
"Having control of Congress is such a critical part of his political plans that the president is visiting as many states as possible.
The event planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and even be covered in Pittsburgh media reports, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help his West Virginia Republican Senate nominee, Patrick Morrisey, who polls say is not in a good position.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to intervene personally to get better at the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team struggles with full shoulder strain in front of Sunday's individual to keep hope alive
After three unilateral attempts, the Ryder Cup was in desperate need of a four-game series Saturday afternoon.
The swinging of luck and momentum is a rather soulful sporting concept, yet every player believes in it, especially in competitions like the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead, and they're only four ahead, so we can say we've got the ball right here", Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe still leads by four points, and there are 12 more to be gained.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they've finally gotten a little back and they can take encouragement from more than one thing, including the likes of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and both scored three out of four.
Spieth proved himself infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
Weaver's victory cries got louder as he progressed through the round, being dismissed with a critical kick and evened in Game 4, so that he and Thomas were at a double-over-double.
The game's decisive buzz resulted in a cheer like hole 15, a kind of cheer that can convince the viewer that the American team is not yet at a loss.
"You just have to dig deep inside yourself and only care about your own game", Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for players.
18 holes for a chance to make a mark on you.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular Ryder Cup pair, have been able to score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe is a strange, but lovely couple that brought four out of four, and they can't seem to make a mistake.
Moliwood was the only pair not above the pair on Saturday afternoon, and they also performed similarly on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine stages of Friday morning.
Thanks to the dynamics of this series and the dynamics between them and the crowd that was supporting them, they were the benchmark for Sunday and no one is more expected to secure a European victory at Le Golf National with the calm of the sun than Fleetwood or Molinar.
The best thing would be a victory over multiple holes at once.
But it would be too early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four, when he was playing alongside Alex Noren.
Once, two strokes above the pair, the Spanish and Swedish made the first nine holes, which drove them into a valley where they had no chance of climbing.
But on Sunday, there'll be no one to help you out of your hole.
Four-ball games and four-ball games are extremely fun to watch from close range, thanks to the interaction of the pairs, and you can see who gives what advice and who doesn't, and how the strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team, and it's starting to have a significant advantage on the final day, but this fourth section has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, even though many of them were lacking, especially from the American side.
Europe begins the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead
Europe can start the final day of the Ryder Cup with a good lead after finishing the four-ball and four-ball games Saturday with a 10-6 record against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way, taking two wins against Tiger Woods, which was a four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, which is seeking to regain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated the American team in the morning four-ball match, winning the series 3-1.
America showed more resistance in the four, winning two games, but they couldn't close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team should have eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a series, while he and Molinari, who are only referred to as Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening games.
After beating Woods' Patrick Reed in the quarterfinals, they beat the unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by a decided 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, sometimes even showed his talent, but he's lost 19 of his 29 games, four of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning foursome, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson, and in the foursome they were defeated 2&1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the pair that made up the world No. 1 and No. 3 rankings.
But Europe did not succeed on this pleasant, windy day, from Paris to the southwest.
Three-time defending champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do it with two points on Saturday.
They scored a painful 2-1 win over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarter-finals, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the quarter-finals after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team managed to come back from a four-point deficit in individual competitions, although a single undefeated run for the Furyk title team is enough to keep the trophy.
But after two days of being only the second best, a Sunday counterattack seems unrealistic.
Kehung to disarm North Korea unilaterally if it does not trust its negotiating partner
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions only increased distrust of the United States and ruled out the country's unilateral surrender of its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Jongho told the World Organization's Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken "significant and generous steps" during the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, closing nuclear test sites and pledging not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
"Unfortunately, we don't see any similar response from the Americans", he said.
 The lack of confidence in America makes us feel that our nation's security is not guaranteed and under these circumstances, it is impossible to disarm unilaterally and first.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment that Washington opposes the idea of a "cross-cutting" nuclear disarmament scenario whereby North Korea would receive rewards for its actions, his statement nevertheless seemed significant because it did not explicitly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as Phenyang had done so far.
Ri cited a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work on the decommissioning of the Korean Peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's integrity.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States believes that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has not yet lifted the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"America insists on nuclear disarmament and increases pressure with sanctions to force its will on us, and also opposes the declaration of war", Ri said.
The idea that we can be forced to kneel by sanctions is a wish of those who do not know us.
The problem is, the non-relieving sanctions only increase our suspicion.
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump was planned, but the US president spoke about it separately at the UN earlier this week.
Rather, the minister pointed out that there have been three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, and added: "If the country involved in nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States of America, then the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a state of disarmament".
Yet Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly that North American missile attacks were inevitable after Trump called the evil president, Kim, a suicide bomber on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with total destruction, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but also noted that much work remains to be done and that sanctions will remain until North Korea finally implements its nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said they didn't set a time limit, so whether it's two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have also argued that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for its actions so far.
In contrast, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be upheld until an effective, final, demonstrable nuclear disarmament is achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rible during the UN General Assembly break and then said he would travel back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go too well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced progress, but hours later, North Korea accused him of making gang-related claims.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States takes appropriate steps.
Mun said the steps Kim mentioned would be security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore or steps that could lead to normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to rest enough
A new Harvard University curriculum this year has encouraged students to get more sleep, also fighting the increasingly ubiquitous cat culture of caffeine-fueled all-night learning.
One academic concluded that students at the world's top universities are often completely lost in how they should take care of themselves.
The course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and practices as a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He was inspired to develop the course by his earlier talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"Finally, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I facing this now, as a senior?'
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised him.
This year's first course will show students how good sleep habits have a fundamental impact on their academic and athletic performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health service, said the university decided to launch the course because students were found to be exceptionally unstable during the week.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
One shows a picture of a college room where students can tap on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how inattention affects sports performance, and why bedtime is important.
In another section, participants are taught how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They will show a map of the campus area with interactive icons to encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know we're not going to change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe that you have the right to this knowledge, just as you have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking, said Professor Czeisler.
The culture that calls for one-night learning a performance is still thriving, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students are causing increasing problems with idleness.
Adequate and quality sleep is a key weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, and even obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain to starve and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So helped design the course for Professor Czeisler, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemistry and biophysics who was the first to take a professor's course at Harvard last year.
He said that those who heard him there opened his eyes and encouraged him to stand up for the establishment of a university-level education.
He hopes that as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training programme before they enter the competition zone.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a bedtime warning, wake-up alarm, and learn about the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily distract them from the rhythm of the day and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston  Rangers 10: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb drove Steven Gerrard's slipped team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrokes were attempting their first overseas victory since their 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered their second defeat to date from Gary Holt's team, who had managed them for 18 games, leaving them eight points behind their first-place finisher in the Ladbrokes Premiership (Scottish Championship) - Heartst.
Menga hit seven minutes into the half, and the Rangers' unmotivated team was still nowhere near the draw.
While the Rangers slipped to sixth place, Livingston clinched third, just behind Hibernian due to goal difference.
The Rangers may also face further difficulties after coast guard Calum Spence suffered a head injury that required medical attention due to an item that was likely thrown from the guests' body.
Gerrard also changed eight points for the team that beat Ayr to reach the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt was so into Livingston that he walked into the same field with the 11 men who took a point off Heartst last week, and he would have been happy to watch his dick-ass team choke on his opponent's game wherever he could.
Although the Rangers led the ball, Livingston led the way with what he got.
They could have scored in the first two minutes when he kicked Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's door with his first shot, but the midfielder failed to sell the wicket.
Keaghan Jacobs landed a low free kick at team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the final third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty in the 15th minute when he clashed with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson overturned his complaints in Colombia.
The Rangers were only able to show off their first two half-hour shots, but the former Ibroxy goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's attempt in the 34th minute was against the previous run of the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers have again missed a zigzag forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond in time when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who found Mengha perfectly for the easy finish.
Gerrard decided to take a break, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that almost immediately demonstrated his impact on the game when the outfielder jumped Morelos, but the impressive form-builder Kelly was blocked in time.
Livingston continued to get him to play exactly the game he liked, and Lithgow and Halkett beat the long balls one after the other.
Holt's team could have gained a bigger lead in the final minutes, but McGregor took the net and put Jacobs in position before Lithgow could have gotten off the hook.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers replacement, tried to fight another 11 when he got into a fight with Jacobs, but he still couldn't convince Thompson.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger calculator
A detail from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the Geiger calculator.
The Geiger counter has since become a staple of science, and the 1950s film, Bells of Coronado, starring odd cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evanst, has become a part of pop culture:
Man: "What's the miracle?"
Rogers: This is a Geiger calculator that can be used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you put on this headset, you can hear the sound of atoms being emitted by the radioactivity of minerals.
Listen, I'm getting a little tired of this.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, which bears his name, lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to kill the antibodies
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to kill and kill the abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a lab.
They can then see the protein that accompanies many cancers, and they send the treated immune cells back to the patient.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize abnormal cells was able to say goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient; modifying them in the laboratory to detect a protein called HER2, which is a common companion to several cancers; and then replanting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.
HER2 is fueling the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, which involves extracting immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells, has been used successfully in the past to treat one type of leukemia.
Kanye West's performance on SNL in the MAGA hat culminated in a Trump-supported smear campaign.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was fired at his Saturday Night Live studio after a disconnected speech praising US President Donald Trump and announcing that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing her third song that night, Ghost Town, on her Make America Great Again cap, she began speaking out against Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone who is white and they ask me, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I was interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago.
SNL's Matt Damon has opened the show with a parody of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh mocking his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment allegations.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to drive West out of the game by uploading.
West even complained to the audience that he was being dirty behind the scenes because of his hat.
I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said you should go out in that hat.
They scared me.
And they said I was in the sinking place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see a place that's sunken? I'm gonna wear my Superman jacket because that means they can't tell me what to do.
Try love.
His performances were accompanied by a public outcry at least twice, and the SNL cast was clearly embarrassed, according to a witness who told Variety: "The entire studio was silently cloaked in silence".
West was invited to replace singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West raised many questions when he performed the song I Love It dressed as a Perrier glass.
West was confirmed by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative TPUSA group, in a tweet: "One of the most courageous spirits,
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply a self-made man, and that's great.
But I have decided NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or fashion items or supporting their art) who I believe holds an ideology and spreads it that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But we've added to it.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following in the footsteps of Diddy, who we know as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and P. Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant stalker charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is due to appear in Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the DA.
Kit Harington, the star of Battle of the Thrones, finds exaggerated masculinity harmful
Kitt Harington is best known as Jon Snow in The Lord of the Rings, and in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series, he often grabs swords.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out against stereotypical cat heroes, noting that seeing such heroes can often make little boys feel that fighting for respect requires hard work.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, he said he felt something was wrong and asked how to address the harmful effects of over-masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her fellow series co-star, Rose Leslie, 31, said he felt it was very important to fix the problem.
I am personally deeply affected by this matter  How is the portrayal of masculinity so distorted? asked the actor.
 What have we taught men as children about the problem we face now?
According to Kit, television is responsible for spreading a distorted image of masculinity, as the shows often feature very masculine characters.
He continued his reflection, adding: "What is it that we were born with, and what is it that we learn?
What does the street and television tell young boys that they feel that this is the only way they can be men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time and how we can change that.
Because it's clear that something's wrong with young men.
In the interview, Kit stated that after the series' summer season finale, it will not be featured in any of the prequels or sequels to Battle of the Thrones, because it has a lot of energy from battlefields and horses.
From November, she will star in the remake of Kit Sam Shepard's True West, about a producer and his brother who leads a robbery-ridden life.
The actor said the best thing he's ever had from Battle of the Thrones is his wife, Rose, whom he met while making the series.
"I met my wife on the set, so my future family and my life ahead of me is all thanks to the series", said Kit.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China's new cases increase by 14%
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that this represents more than 820,000 people affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by around 40 000.
A change from previous infections is that a significant majority of newly infected people get the disease sexually.
The disease spread rapidly through blood transfusions previously infected parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province said that the number of such cases has since decreased to almost zero.
Nevertheless, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to various studies, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men end up marrying women because of the country's conservative values.
In many cases, the disease is transmitted through inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
The Chinese government has been providing universal access to HIV medicines since 2003 as part of a programme to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked the data of Republican senators and condemns dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected accusations that a member of her staff posted personal information about three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by far-right experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more subtle lies", Waters tweeted.
The information released allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senator Mike Lee and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday, the identity of the publisher unknown, but it is certain that it was posted from Capitol Hill during the Senate hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on sexual harassment.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as the Gateway Pundit and RedState, have linked the source-identifiable IP address to Waters' office, and data on a member of Waters' staff has been released, The Hill reports.
"These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously false", Waters continued.
 My staff member is not liable for any leakage of information, but his right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been violated by the fraudulent and false accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously false.
Waters's comments were quickly met with criticism on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
"This is an angry denial", Fleischer wrote.
 It appears from this that Waters does not have the temperament to be a Member.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, you can't react with anger.
You can't be so mean.
You cannot question the motives of the accuser.
You need to stay calm and calm.
Waters' reaction was apparently likened to Fleischer's response to criticism from Justice Kavanaugh's Democratic Party, who some critics said seemed too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is running for the Republican seat in Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
If true, it's serious in his message.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of the false allegations.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified Waters continued and that they are held legally liable for any act that threatens or harms any member of my staff
Johnny English is hitting me again, or Rowan Atkinson's crippling spy game.
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in every British film, and no exception to this is the Johnny English action/parody franchise, whose first part, Johnny English, was released in 2003 and the second, Johnny English, was re-released in 2011.
Will sarcastic, self-parodying satires that perpetuate our own obvious paralysis become the new export product of the British nation?
So certain that the disgusting, rubbery-wearing, incompetent Johnny English had ammunition enough to make another comeback -- and it's clear from his name -- that this comic character was created to be laughed at by the masses of non-English-speaking countries around the world.
Johnny English is of course a pushy undercover agent who imagines himself to be a conqueror with his bizarre manners, which reminds me a little of Superintendent Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and sometimes the guy who, by pressing a single button, helped to play the title role of the Firefighters at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is also based on the mysterious international journey that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, and which left chaos everywhere.
There's a couple good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English, dressed in medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and then when he got there, the rotors were hitting his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comic vein is well-established in the film, but the film's humor doesn't really work, and it seems superfluous, because today's "serious" sound franchises like the James Bond films or the Mission Impossible series are bravely using the humor.
To feel that the film's humor is more about children, and to me Johnny English's short-lived, failed adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings to the silent scenes of Mr. Bean.
The film's starting point is eternal: Great Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal has hacked into the super-super-online network of the British spy network and exposed the identities of all British agents to the greatest horror of the undercover agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got such a small role in the film.
This could be the final nail in the coffin of a haughty and divisive prime minister whose political popularity is in decline anyway: Emma Thompson is basically playing Theresa May, and she's making everything out of her otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisers have outlined that since the identities of every active agent have been revealed, he should hire a retired agent to do the job.
This retired agent is, of course, not much more than the two-left Johnny English, who has been a teacher in a prestigious school since his retirement, but instead of teaching the subject, he teaches children to spy.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he meets again at the emergency room with his long-suffering former gunman, Bough, who is now played by Ben Miller.
Bough has since married and married a submarine captain whose mouth is always on the lips. Captain Vicki Pepperdine is playing a much better role.
So His Majesty's National Security Service's two-left Batman and Robin pair is back in action, pitting themselves against Ophelia Bullet, played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, a woman of true destiny.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly being networked by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and he's being played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: they set fire to a fancy French restaurant disguised as waiters, then, amidst a spectacular turnaround, they sneak into Volta's luxury yacht, and English actually unleashes hell when he uses a VR headset to try to get to know Volta's apartment.
These stations are necessary to get to the final conclusion, but whatever fun and turnaround you've made, it's a little too much of a children's movie.
The end result is rather mediocre.
Like the other Johnny English films, I was wondering if the British film industry could finally give Rowan Atkinson a talented role.
The British Labour Party denies introducing a four-day workweek while paying the British for five-day workweek
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan: to introduce a four-day workweek, all by making workers work for five days' wages.
The party allegedly wants workers to benefit from the benefits of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving executives extra day off to work due to increased earnings.
The plan would give workers three days' weekends while taking home the same amount as before.
Sources say the idea is part of the party's economic agenda to put the language of the balance on the workers' side in the country.
The idea of a four-day workweek is also supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, which believes that workers can benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, the four-day workweek is an idea that fits well with the party's programme to shift the balance of power towards the workers in the economy and also fits well with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Green Party has already campaigned in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day work week.
However, the idea is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day workweek is not part of the Party's policy and is not even on the agenda.
Shadow Secretary of the Treasury John McDonnell presented his vision for a socialist revolution affecting the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he's fighting hard to get back power from the ruthless directors and the profiteers of the companies.
If the Shadow Finance Minister's plans were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water companies would not receive the full profits they deserve, as a workers' government would make rebates as a punishment for alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he planned to include workers on the board and to set up Inclusive Property Funds which would group 10% of the shares of private sector companies into employees, thus earning 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes, they told us that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh will lead to a final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court at least a week later than originally scheduled, and the question is whether the outcome of the investigation will discourage Republican lawmakers from supporting Kavanaugh.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his colleague in South Carolina.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I said that before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke out, the charges came out, and I said, "What did you do?"
The answer was clear and definite.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be concrete.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and I'm going to need extremely serious charges to change my mind", Graham said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett has vehemently denied the allegations. He added Graham, Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford have substantiated the allegations.
It's a 36-year story.
I don't think anything new will be found.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it succeeded in alleviating poverty?
The annual music event, the Global Citizen Festival, begins in New York City on Saturday, where world stars will rise to speak out for a truly noble cause: global poverty eradication.
The Global Citizen Festival is now in its seventh edition, and tens of thousands are expected to fill Central Park's Grand Place, where attendees will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, or Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the event's real goal: eradicating poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first organised in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project, which is run by an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by involving more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
The concert is free for those (unless they are willing to pay for VIP tickets) who undertake certain tasks or activities such as volunteering, emailing a leading politician, making a phone call or any other substantive activity to draw attention to the project's goal: poverty alleviation.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goals over the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective way to reward people with concert tickets to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of what's called click activism, where people feel they've contributed substantially to a cause by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million actions have been carried out by project sponsors, which have served a number of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to the allocation of $37 billion by world leaders to poverty policies and commitments that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The group also claimed that the Commission had not yet received any information on the financial situation of the group.
The group estimates that the money raised has directly affected the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and developers to help children reach their potential. The organisation pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help tackle hunger after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
With the support of the UK government, and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put social injustice and malnutrition on the history books  said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after asking the UK for more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and their children, the government has allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions published on the Global Citizen website is: "Why do you think that poverty can be eradicated?"
Global Citizen responds: "It's going to be a long, hard road, and sometimes we're going to get stuck and sometimes we're going to fail.
But like the civil rights and anti-segration movements of the past, we are achieving our goal because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will also perform at this year's event in New York City, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as hosts.
US Navy would use naval blockade to block Russian energy exports
If necessary, Washington would even use the Navy to stop Russian energy carriers from entering the market, so that Russian energy could not reach the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke quoted in the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russia's active presence in Syria  in particular, in relation to Russian operations carried out at the request of the legitimate Syrian government  is merely an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
"I think they're only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", Zinke said in a statement.
And the interior minister says there are ways to stop the Russians.
"The United States can use its navy to ensure that the sea lanes are open and can block them if necessary, so that it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets", Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the participants of an event organized by the nonprofit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which otherwise defines itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, noting that they were practically the same methods.
Iran and Russia can be economically sanctioned in much the same way: using existing energy carriers and introducing new ones said Zinke, while calling Russia a one-dimensional economy, pointing to the country's dependence on fossil energy carriers.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, senior officials of the Trump administration, including the president himself, are persuading Germany to back down from a project called the North Stream 2 pipeline, which if implemented, would make Germany a Moscow hotbed.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double existing capacity and thus increase to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project only.
The Kremlin says Washington is so strongly opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
I assume we share the same view that energy should not be used for pressure exercises and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attempt to persuade was a setback, as Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has called on the USA not to interfere in EU energy policy as it does with bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
'I find it a problem when a third country intervenes in our energy affairs,' said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after the last meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is seriously considering running for president in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she's seriously considering running for president.
Warren, Massachusetts, confirmed at a city council meeting in Holyoke that he's considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix a bad government, and it's time for a woman to be president", Warren told The Hill.
After November 6, I'm seriously considering running for president.
At the town hall, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said he thought he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", Warren said.
Warren has been vocal about Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, according to a survey published on Thursday, a majority of Warren Massachusetts voters do not think Warren should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Policy Analysis and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters who voted Warren "good" say the senator should not run for president until
32% of them support Warren's candidacy.
The poll found that the majority of respondents, 38 percent, would support former Governor Deval Patrick's presidential candidacy and 48 percent would oppose it.
The 2020 presidential election also featured high-profile Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will decide by January whether to run.
Sarah Palin Track referred to Palin's PTSD at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested on Monday night on domestic violence charges.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he came home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the appalling consequences of PTSD, and the wounds that our soldiers are going through when they come home", Sarah Palin told the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
He called the arrest of Palin's son the elephant in the room, and said that his son, like other war veterans, had returned changed, hardened, and kept wondering whether he would pay due respect to the service that his comrades, pilots and other members of the military have done for the country.
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on suspicion of domestic violence against a woman, and Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said that Track Palin was also reported to have used a weapon to commit domestic violence there.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington, D.C., also support a judicial review of the new U.S. asylum policy that would deny asylum to those fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different states and Washington, D.C., wrote an expert letter Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging politics in court, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
The woman claimed that she was abused by her partner and the sons of a violent gang, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
The woman is being held in Texas.
State prosecutors in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the source of many asylum claims to the United States, which are constantly plagued by gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum while fleeing domestic violence.
Karl Racine, attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each case, and such an obstacle violates this principle The expert letter states.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that immigration denial policies are detrimental to the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and fill the lowest levels of jobs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered asylum judges in June not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and escaping gangs.
Asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of a well-founded fear of persecution or persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political belief  Sessions said at the time of the policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum law was not invented to solve all the problems that people face every day around the world, no matter how serious.
Desperate rescue in Palula, deaths doubled, rescue efforts are racing with time
The situation of the survivors is becoming increasingly bleak.
"Everyone is very nervous", says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while sedating a fever-prone young boy at an evacuation center in Palu.
 EMTs are bringing the bodies every minute.
We barely have any drinking water.
Some residents returned to their ruined homes to get out of the wreckage that could still be salvaged.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are unable to provide adequate care.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken spine and shoulder, were taken to the Palui Military Hospital, where they were placed outside the hospital building due to severe burns.
The man's eyes were filled with lightning as he remembered how the fifth-floor hotel room he had occupied with his wife and daughter had been engulfed in the devastating earthquake.
There was no time to escape.
I think I'm stuck in the collapsed walls. Harris told the Associated Press, then said his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of spreading propaganda
The US Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the US press, a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that highlighted the mutual benefits of US-China trade relations.
US President Donald Trump cited an ad in the China Daily Des Moines Register last Wednesday in Iowa's largest-selling newspaper, while accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marks a new stage in Washington's increasingly aggressive campaign against China, according to US officials who told Reuters.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, there is an increasingly intense trade war between Beijing and Washington, which imposes more and more tariffs on each other's imported products.
U.S. and Chinese experts say that at the beginning of the trade war, tariffs imposed by the Chinese in response sought to target exporters from countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who served for several terms, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses because Iowa exports a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is further infuriating our country by publishing propaganda in our own free press.
The Chinese government is exploiting the highly respected American tradition of free speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register  Branstad wrote.
 However, if you go to a newspaper store in Beijing, you hardly find critical articles.  The Chinese press does not faithfully reflect the differing opinions of the Chinese people about the increasingly dire growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.
Branstad added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but the newspaper did not name it.
Analysts say Republicans could alienate female voters before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh scandal.
Analysts say it could be a blowback that many high-ranking Republican politicians are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the wake of sexual harassment allegations, potentially losing support from women voters in the run-up to midterm elections.
The case sparked a lot of emotion, and most Republicans publicly declared they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be withdrawn", says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the FBI investigation proposed by Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona at the last minute would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow, and in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn, a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters in the Senate lobby chanted "November is coming!" because despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee has decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will jump to an astonishing degree", independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news agency.
Many people say it was too high, and that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among urban women voters who are uncertain and young people (18-29 years old) who are not enthusiastic about the president but often don't go to vote.
Analysts had already assumed that Ford could back down on Republicans if they continued to stand for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, and Ford has since detailed in his confession why he accuses the Supreme Court nominee of sexual harassment.
The Republican Party was on the wrong footing, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News earlier this week.
"This is not just about the committee vote and the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is going to be appointed, but also how the Republicans handled the case and how they handled Ford", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, which helps elect Democrats.
But it seems that Americans are quite divided as to whether they believe Ford's statement or Kavanaugh's.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believed Ford's statement more or less fully, and 35% of respondents in Kavanaugh said the same.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents believe that Kavanaugh was likely or likely to have lied in his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believe that about Ford.
Under Flake's influence, the FBI is currently investigating the veracity of Ford's claims, as is Kavanaugh's other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee a week ago that he was abused by Kavanaugh when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party in the 1980s when they were both studying at Yale.
The inventor of the Internet would launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup with the goal of raising the competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access the individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to gain global dominance.
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
 This is a historic moment.
The application with Solid technology allows people to create their own personal online data warehouse, otherwise known as POD.
This may include lists, tentlists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available from the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of an online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access their data.
The company calls this the exercise of the right of self-determination of individuals over data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company's mission is to provide the resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few contracted developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not asking Facebook and Google to implement the technology that will bring about total change that will put business models at the top of their head overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a statement published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee said that the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solidra network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been a key opinion maker in recent months in debates surrounding Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute, despite launching Inrupt.
"I am endlessly optimistic about the next era of the world wide web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann Victorian Crusader, minister of the First World War, celebrated
The only Victorian to receive the Cross is an Anglican priest who celebrates his hometown 100 years after his heroic actions in World War I.
Sergeant Bernard Vann was awarded the medal for his actions in the Bellenglise and Lehacourt offensives of 29 September 1918.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew he deserved the highest honor in the British armed forces.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a celebration on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was of symbolic significance that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather's act of merit.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann carried his flag across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 amid thick fog and heavy gunfire and machine gun fire.
He then rushed to the front line, and with extraordinary heroism, he led the flagship, then raided a camp artillery unit alone, destroying three of its members.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
"I know I'll never get to what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility", said 72-year-old Michael Vann about his grandfather.
After a performance by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also sculpted the memorial.
Michael Vann said he was honored to have played a part in the ceremony, adding: "The courage of a true hero is shown by how many people later pay their respects to him".
MMA fans have been on the air all night watching Bellator 206, instead of getting a Peppa doll.
Imagine you spent the whole night on the air to watch the exciting Bellator 206 and that's where the broadcast is going.
The San Jose show featured 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live at night as part of the main competition show in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, to the surprise of the English audience, Peppa Pig was put on the show instead of the match.
This was a problem for many who stayed up until the early hours of the morning because of the collision.
A children's cartoon instead of an MMA match was dubbed a "sick joke" by one of the fans on Twitter.
The State legislation says that at 6am the channel can no longer broadcast such content, so it had to switch to children's programmes  Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator's communications and marketing department, said about the broadcast.
♪ Yes, it's Peppa, time for the puppy. ♪
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, has promised that in the future, the show's schedule will be revised to include viewers in the UK.
I think repeating it will definitely solve this problem, Coker said.
 However, since it is 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, we cannot fix the situation until Sunday, which is now Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when you switched on the show, there were a lot of messages coming in, and most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first, we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But that's not what we were talking about. We were facing a legal problem.
But I can promise you that next time, that won't happen.
Instead of the six that we've had so far, there's only five games on the show. We really wanted to please the audience, but we've paid off.
It was an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggled with minority complex due to his sexual orientation
Tom Daley at the Olympics said that when he was young, he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation, but that was what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says that it wasn't until high school that he realized that almost everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told the host she was fighting for gay rights to give hope to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he's been less interested in the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has missed several months due to illness.
On Laverne's first show, Daley, who was invited as a shipwreckster, said that as a young man he felt less than anyone else because he was socially unacceptable to anyone who loved boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, the feeling of inferiority and of being different is what I have to endure and empower to achieve my success".
He wanted to prove he was worthy of being a vampire so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when he was exposed to his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, using her performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, urged governments around the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he was speaking out because he felt lucky to live his life openly, without negative consequences, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he was "absolutely surprised" when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar-winning screenwriter who was 20 years older than her got married last year, and she claims the age difference never caused a problem between them.
"If you go through so much as a young man", he said, "you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 14 years old, you're 20 years old, you're 20 years old, you're 20 years old, you're 20 years old, you're 20 years old, you're 20 years old, you're 20 years old, you're 20 years old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old, you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old, you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you're old and you'
In June, the couple adopted a young boy, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who Daley himself confessed had completely changed his attitude toward the world.
If I was asked this question last year, I would have said the most important thing was to win a gold medal.
But you know what I figured out?
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The baby was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley's statement said his father was reluctant to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, as he wanted to sit in the front row.
I was unable to answer him that, "Dad, you're not going to be there in the front row".
I held his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment I could not accept that my father was not invulnerable.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and earned a bronze medal.
I felt like this was what I'd dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, it felt like nothing better.
The song that inspired her first choice was Heather Small Proud, which helped her prepare for the Olympics and she still licks her skin when she hears it.
Desert Island Discs is on Sunday, starting at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of shape and was on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson could set a record by taking part in the 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he'll have to get back in shape if he doesn't want this milestone to be an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson is making a record 12th appearance at the biennial event, but his performance in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games led to him being sent off by team captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of having five major championship wins as the focus of the game as many times as the United States has had to fight for victory, he now spends half the day playing soccer for his team, the other half on the court, trying to correct the game-weakening errors.
He was never among the most accurate hitters at the peak of his career, so the 48-year-old is not exactly on the narrow course of Le Golf National, where high grass costs a very high price for wrong hits.
And if the track itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the English champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who won all four games this week with Tommy Fleetwood, the starting pitcher.
If the Americans start four points behind the 12 individual games, Mickelson's game could be a decisive one.
Stryk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
"He's fully aware of the role he played in the development of today, he hit me in the back, he hugged me and promised he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
 Very confident.
He's one of the greatest, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
I basically didn't play him two games.
I had more planned, but in the circumstances, we decided it was the best solution.
He wants to be on the court, just like everyone else.
Mickelson's performance on Sunday will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
This may conclude a series of Ryder Cups that are far behind the individual performance of the player.
Mickelson may have 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk stressed that the presence of the veteran player also brings tangible benefits to the team.
"Funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of others", a great team member explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed the games against him, and it's good to see that.
His presence goes beyond the strict sense of play.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone gets a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup, one-on-one matches, luck can easily turn their backs.
The Danish player made his first appearance in a Valderram match in 1997, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point lead over the Americans, and in the end they managed to retain a hairline lead to a 141⁄2131⁄2 win ratio.
"We must always remind ourselves that despite our great advantage at Valderrama, we won only by one stroke, and we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we finally got knocked out", said Bjørn, seen in the picture, after winning Class 5'3 on Friday and yesterday, leading to 10'6 at Le Golf National.
 If we think about the races of the past few years, everyone can see that the game is not over.
You'll have to play full force tomorrow.
So let's go and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal that is nothing but to win this trophy, and that's all we need to focus on right now.
As I said before, I'm mostly concerned with the 12 players on our team, but we also have to look at the other side, who happen to be among the greatest players in the world.
Bjørn, proud of the team's performance on the hard track, added: "I would never make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow's the day with the whole cake.
Then it's all about individual performance, which is completely different than team play.
It's great to play in a couple when things are going well, but when you stand out individually, it's all about what kind of golfer you really are.
That's what you have to teach the players to get the best out of them tomorrow.
They'll have to break up with their partner, who will also have to get in shape.
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, is confident that his players will perform better in singles than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas' doubles, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk has personally experienced both sides of the Last Day Resurrection: at Brookline, he was a member of the winning team, then on the losing side after the European team's bravery at Medinah, which was hailed as a miracle.
I remember every damn word he answered when asked because he encouraged players before the final day of the 1999 Ben Crenshaw team.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we're doing best with a quick start, like we did in Brookline, like we did in Medinah.
If one team really gets into the game, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent's players in the middle of the game.
We have arranged the order accordingly and trained our players to perform a real miracle tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with leading the reversal efforts and plays Rory McIlroy in the first game, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
"That's why I decided to go along with the sequence, because I think that's how it goes from beginning to end".
The delivery of Germany's latest warship has been postponed again.
The German Navy's latest frigate was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, it will wait until at least next year.
The new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate flagship, the Rhineland-Palatinate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, Die Zeit weekly newspaper quoted an army spokesman as saying.
The ship was originally scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the continuing delays have made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
The Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates in 2007 to replace the Brema-class ageing frigates.
We know it will be equipped with a large fire cannon and various anti-aircraft and anti-submarine missiles and disguise technology, including a signal attenuator that reduces radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that they require less maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from their mothers.
However, the project's continuing decline may mean that these high-tech warships, which Germany could use to sense its power overseas, will become obsolete when they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The F125 heavy frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially declined to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
The reasons for the return were not much reported, but the German media mentioned several critical software and hardware errors that render the warship unusable in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies are a major problem, as the Baden-Württemberg-class warships will have a crew of only 120 sailors, which is only half the crew of the old Brema-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship was extremely overweight, which impaired its performance and made it impossible for the Navy to make further modifications later.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is said to be twice as heavy as similar class ships commissioned by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the project has already cost an astonishing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial project was €2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance given that Germany's maritime presence is undermining, according to warnings.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's National Defence Committee, recently acknowledged that the Navy is running out of warships in good condition.
The official said that the problem had become a daunting one since the old ships had to be dismantled but there were no more ships to replace the ones that were falling.
He expressed concern that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy's fleet.
The National Trust is investigating the bats' secret lives
New research is underway on a Scottish farm to find out how bats use the characteristics of the landscape when hunting.
The researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals, which could also benefit future conservation initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will study the behaviour of common and soap dwarfs, brown long-eared dwarfs and water bats at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders shall be placed at appropriate points in the area to record the activity of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will be using handheld detectors to collect mobile data.
A detailed analysis of the sound material on the recordings can determine the frequency of the bats' sounds and what species is doing.
Researchers also produce a habitat map and report that helps to determine in detail how animals behave depending on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS's conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal what habitat bats are most interested in and what species use it.
This information will help to identify the beneficial effects of habitat management activities, such as the development of grasslands, and how best to conserve forest areas for bats and other species concerned.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bats has declined significantly over the last century.
Construction and development work disrupts the animals' habitats and reduces their habitat.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are exposed paper, certain chemical processes used in building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually completely blind.
However, because they are nocturnal predators, they rely more on their hearing than their sight when hunting.
Their sophisticated ultrasound-reflection techniques can help them determine the exact location of insects and the terrain they travel.
NTS, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
They work with ten trained professionals who regularly conduct studies and bedside exams and occasionally participate in rescue work.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to property manager David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
You said you had a great place for bats in Threave.
 There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is necessary for a good living space.
But we still don't know much about bats, and thanks to our work here and in other similar fields, we can learn more about what they need to feel good.
He also stressed the importance of verifying that bats live there before building up buildings, as the destruction of a single settlement could result in the death of 400 females and young, leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
The law prohibits the killing, harassment and planing of bats as protected animals.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has also asked for the public's help.
He stated: "There is still much we do not know about bats, and we have almost no information about the status of the populations of most native species.
Ronaldo denies rape charges, his lawyers file a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has made false headlines about allegations of rape against him, saying others want to use his name to get in the public eye.
The football lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which is defending the charges.
A Portuguese football manager and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorta, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
The woman said the athlete paid her $375,000 to hear about the case, she wrote to Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were uncovered, 33-year-old Ronaldo announced in an Instagram Live video with 142 million fans that the news was false.
No, no, no, no, no and no.
All the things they put together about me today were lies the five-time golden-ball player told the camera.
They want to use my name to get in the public eye.
That's what happens.
They want to make a name for themselves with me, that's the way the public is.
I'm a happy man and my life is fine. He added a smile to the player.
Due to the allegations, which have been described as unacceptable and private-life suspicions, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, Reuters reports.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will claim damages for the moral damage caused to the extent that the seriousness of the infringement is appropriate, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights committed in recent years.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athlete's apartment where the man analytically raped a woman, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney's Office in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him he was a good guy 99 percent, except for a bad one percent.
Based on the information in the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having sexual relations with the woman, but he believed it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and even made a statement about his injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he feared retaliation and public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the agreement as the trauma of the incident continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was in the process of being transferred from Real Madrid to Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer the Italian giant Juve bought him for €100 million.
Brexit: the UK will forever mourn the loss of car factories
The UK will be forever sad if it loses its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
It added that Toyota UK was concerned by the statement made to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the car factory would be forced to temporarily cease production at its Burnacon plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses due to border delays.
The Burnachton plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU Member States.
'I see that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production stoppages at the plant,' said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaughton.
Other UK carmakers (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) also expressed concern about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, announced that it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern for car manufacturers is that a no-deal Brexit poses risks to the supply chain.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is running on a timely basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, industry representatives say that border disturbances could lead to production delays and spare parts shortages.
Toyota claims that it would be impossible to store enough parts for more than one day at its Derbyshire plant and therefore production should be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was specifically designed to avoid late border checks.
'We need an agreement, and we want the best possible terms, so that we can not only enjoy the fruits of our current successes but also offer new opportunities,' he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
 Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers can confirm that we certainly need to maintain our currently highly successful supply chain.
Toyota was not able to say how long production would be suspended, but warned that the associated costs could deteriorate the competitiveness of the plant in the long run, which could ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnacht factory for 24 years and currently represents Unite, union members are increasingly concerned: 'In my experience, jobs that have been lost will never be recovered.'
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations.
Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House said.
The high-profile meeting between Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump could be postponed by another week as the debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian influence in the election, possible ties between Trump's advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
Washington has been speculating for months whether Trump will eventually steal the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
According to the New York Times report this month, Rosenstein was considering coming to the meeting on cable to record a conversation with the president, and the question was raised as to whether the 25th Amendment would allow Trump to be removed.
Rosenstein denied the claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House and was rumored to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in New York before the United Nations, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he would be happy to arrest Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and a woman who allegedly sexually assaulted him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on the Fox News show Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "We don't have a date yet, we can set it this week, but given the Supreme Court's case, I see a chance for another one-week delay.
It will soon be known, and I will, as always, notify the press.
Some journalists, however, have been skeptical of the statement, as Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host of the show, asked me why.
Sanders replied that the rarity of press conferences was not due to the resentment of television reporters over sensation-hunting behavior, but he added: "I do not dispute the fact that I am indeed sensation-hunting".
He then indicated that direct meetings between Trump and his press representatives would be more frequent.
The President interviewed more questions than any previous President has said. He even added, without substantiating the claim:
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States questions, it's better in light years than if they talk to me.
We've been trying to get this line up a lot, and there have been a number of such occasions in the last few weeks, so instead of the White House press conference, you can talk to the president of the United States in person.
Trump regularly answers reporters' questions when he leaves the White House, or attends public events, perhaps press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
But press conferences held alone are rare.
That's why, perhaps, we can infer from what happened this week when the president in New York produced a disorderly and occasionally bizarre performance in front of the press.
The head of the health wallet wrote to NHS Scotland's EU staff about concerns about Brexit
The head of the health portfolio wrote a letter thanking the NHS staff from across the European Union and stressing that he hoped they would stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's expected departure.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of EU citizens applying for residence permits in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: The summer of the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued, with a decision expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also begun to prepare a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand how troubling this may be for you.
So I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of their country of origin.
Workers from the various EU Member States and other countries are providing valuable experience and expertise to help with the work of the health portfolio, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home entirely, and we would love you to stay with us.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He walked to the shore and just fell", Reed said.
Members of the coaching staff and medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the track, then put him on a stretcher, and took him for further examinations.
An official at Tennessee State in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was past the surgery that was performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he has not yet learned any further details about the type and extent of the injury while Tennessee State is working to determine the exact time of the injury.
Abercrombie, the sophomore who's been on a year-long hiatus, is in his first season with Tennessee State, where he transferred from Illinois.
He had five successful setups on Saturday before leaving the track, so he's now 18th in the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on real estate purchased in the UK
Under Toryk's new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on real estate purchased in the UK, and the surplus from this would help the homeless
With this move, I would neutralize Corbyn's success among young voters.
The tax increase is aimed at non-UK taxpayers
The Treasury estimates that this would mean an annual income of £120 million, which would be used to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on property purchased in the UK and the surplus proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May is set to announce at a press conference today.
The move is likely to offset Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, which he achieved by promising more affordable housing and measures targeting high-income people.
The tax increase will affect individuals and companies who tax outside the United Kingdom and will use the surplus income generated to fight homelessness.
The additional fee to the current fee, which is to be calculated in excess of the higher fee charged two years ago on second dwellings or buildings purchased for expenditure purposes, may be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects an annual revenue of £120 million as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are bought by nationals outside the UK, causing a significant increase in prices which makes the situation of first home buyers increasingly difficult.
Many of the country's affluent districts have become ghost towns, especially in the capital, as many foreign shoppers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people waiting for their first home.
He personally holds the construction companies responsible for keeping real estate prices high, who have become accustomed to buying and letting land go to foreclosure, and he has asked May to cancel quotas on affordable housing and start something about the housing market shyness in the country.
Corbyn has presented a number of remarkable proposals for housing reforms, including the abolition of rent control and unjustified evictions.
It would also provide more legal framework and opportunities for councils to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would like to dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the English dream and making life better for every generation.
This will require an adjustment of the real estate market.
Britain will continue as always to be open to anyone who wants to live, work and raise a family here.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country and companies with foreign interests to be able to buy real estate as easily as hardworking British citizens.
Dreams of home becoming too much for too many people have become almost inaccessible, and the dishonorable condition of homelessness too much.
I'm more interested in being the manager of the Scottish team.
Jack Ross, Sunderland coach, has said his greatest wish is to manage the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would be happy to take on the challenges of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in the top flight, just three points behind the top-ranked.
He then moved his seat to the Stadium of Light after successfully taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Football League First Division last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
Unfortunately, I only managed to get into the reserves", Ross said on BBC Sportsound.
When I was a kid, I watched a lot of Scottish football games with my dad in Hampden, and something always drew me back to them.
But now I have a chance to succeed as a club manager.
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland management position include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not worried about having to follow in the footsteps of such big names and has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
I'm measuring my success right now by whether I can get the team back to first class.
If you consider the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that he is in the top division.
It won't be easy to get back, but it's more than likely that I'll only be successful in my activity here if I can get the club back.
Ross' managerial career began just three years ago, after serving as a substitute coach for Dumbarton for a time and spending 15 months in the coaching staff of Hearts.
He then helped Aolla to the top of the standings after the team fell back to the third division and St. Mirren, who was on the verge of falling, won the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more confident now than he's ever felt in his playing career, whether it's Clyde or Hartlepool or Falkirk or St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
It was a defining moment. He mentioned his time as coach of the Alloa.
I clearly thought management was more for me than being a player.
It sounds weird, because I did a great job, I did a great job, and I actually had some really memorable moments.
But the life of players is sometimes very hard.
You have to go through a lot of things every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but management is my responsibility.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've experienced it, I feel the best in my skin as an adult.

A study found that the best beer falls at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays
The summer heat wave has seen a significant increase in the traffic of disadvantaged pubs in England, but there is still a lot of pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the data collected, pubs and bars' revenue increased by 2,7% in July, while restaurants' revenue decreased by 4,8%.
Peter Martin, employee of the CGA Business Advisory Office, which compiles statistics, commented: Due to the sunny period and England's longer-than-expected World Cup performance, the trend continued in July last month, when pubs also saw a 2.8% revenue increase, with the difference being that there could be a greater decline in restaurants.
The 1.8% decline in revenue for restaurants in June continued to worsen in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol in particular performed best, producing even higher growth than the drop in the number of restaurants.
The constant sunlight has also affected pubs that tend to serve more food, though not nearly as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems people are more likely to drink at this time.
Revenue from drinks in pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6,6% this month and revenue from food fell by 3%.
According to Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the leisure and hospitality industry: "These results follow a trend that has been on the rise since the end of April.
The weather and major community and sporting events continue to be the main revenue driver for the entertainment and hospitality industries.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains are in a difficult situation and a 4.8% annual revenue decline can be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer for restaurant operators could not have come at a worse time, and it will only be seen in time whether the milder weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area.
The overall revenue growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2,7% in July, which also reflects the slowing pace of new brand introduction.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales to the UK hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is a widely accepted industry benchmark, collects and analyses the performance data of a 47-member group of operators with a turnover of over 9 billion.
One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents
One survey found that one in five children (at least 11 years old) has a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20 000 secondary school students showed that the number of Insta sites is increasing
The news increases fear of sharing sexual content
20% of students said they had a school principal's account that their parents could see.
One in five children (at age 11 or so) creates a social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that the number of Instagram accounts that refer to Instagram photo sharing sites is rapidly increasing.
The news has raised fears of sharing sexual content.
20% of the students answered that they have a spotless primary school account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a profile of a teenager that said "rape me".
Research by the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) representing Digital Awareness UK and independent school principals and principals (DIs) shows that 40% of 1118 year olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having private accounts.
"I find it appalling that so many teenagers feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers can't reach them", said HMC head Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletic Association.
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Association at the annual meeting of the board.
Doyle, Scotland's most successful athlete and chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, said the athlete's extensive international experience over the past decade will be an invaluable help to sports decision-makers.
"Eilidh is held in high esteem in Scotland, the UK and the international athletics community, and his presence will help the development of Scottish athletics", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be the voice of athletes and I hope to really help the work of Scottish sports leaders".
The BBC regularly reports that two of the four Olympic gold medals won by American athletes in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta were forcibly removed from the wheelchair by a temporary brain disorder.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said they'd decide in time if I'd come back at all.
I'm trying to be human, but I've made a full recovery, I can walk again, I'm going to go to agility training today.
Thank you for the many encouraging messages.
Breastfeeding ads that liken mothers to cows divide the online community
Heves has sparked controversy online with an advertisement from a breastfeeding company that likened breastfeeding mothers to head-breastfeeding.
Elvie claims to have developed the world's first silent wearable breast pump and announced the launch of their product in an ironic commercial that quoted music videos showing the freedom it gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dancing in a cow stand full of hay, with the lyrics in the background, which are the following lines: "Yes, I'm getting over myself, I don't have a dick yet, and if I didn't notice, these are not my nails, but my breasts".
And the chorus goes like this: "I pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, and pump, pump, pump, and pump, pump, and pump, and pump, and pump, and pump, and pump, and pump, and pump, and pump, and pump, and pump, and pumps are all the other things.
An ad posted on the company's Facebook page soon became the subject of online controversy.
The video has garnered 77,000 views and hundreds of mixed-reception comments, with many saying the ad is a mockery of the dairy industry's horrors.
Advertise the product with very tasteless cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only when they give birth to their offspring, but their wines are taken away within days, one speaker recalls.
The Elvie breast feeder can be placed discreetly in a breast feeder (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentary says, "Yes, it's terrible for the mother and calf.
But why not use them to sell breastfeeding to mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added: "It's a completely insensitive advertisement".
Others have defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the video was "very funny".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it if I'd still been breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
This is a silly commercial, so I'm not gonna try to watch it anymore.
The product is brilliant.
Another commentator said: "This is a funny ad for mothers who are breastfeeding at work or in a bathroom who feel like they're getting pregnant.
It does not praise or condemn the dairy coast.
At the end of the video, the women show that they were wearing a discreet breast pump in their bra while dancing.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breast implants sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, without wires and tubes, and can be placed discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, or even move out while sucking.
According to Ana Balarin, Mother's co-owner and communications director, "The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By highlighting the parallels between women breastfeeding and breastfeeding, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using breast implants and to show in a funny way how our breast implants provide a sense of freedom in this regard.
This isn't the first time Elvie's breast pump has been in the news.
At the London Divathé, a mother of two walked into the runway in a Marta Jakubowski dress while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly transferred to a camp on the Texas border
The number of child migrants held in detention has reached record levels, while the number of border crossings per month has changed little, partly because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and measures so far, making it harder to find accommodation for them.
Adopters are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that applying for children would ruin their chances of staying in the country.
This threat was further compounded in June when it was announced that parents applying for asylum and adults living with them in a household would have to give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, chief official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in a statement to Congress last week that dozens of people have been arrested for applying to take in unaccompanied minors.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had an unpaid sentence.
80% of the applicants and those living with them in the same household are in the country illegally and a significant proportion are convicted criminals.
That's why we're continuing to search for such individuals, Albence said.
To speed up the proceedings against children, new rules have been introduced, which require that one of them appear before the court within one month of his detention instead of the previous 60 days, social workers claim.
Many people apply to the court by videoconference instead of personal appearances to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge doesn't provide legal protection, the immigrant will be deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer detention is, the more nervous and depressed children become, and the more likely they are to experience violent outbreaks or attempted escape.
Advocates say that these risks are only increased by a larger facility like Torrilloni, where the number of children makes it harder to screen out those in need of psychological care.
They added that if children are not given enough time to prepare or to say goodbye to friends before being transferred to such a facility, they are more traumatized.
Syria has called for the immediate withdrawal of the US, French and Turkish occupying forces.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the country's eighth year of civil war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces had illegally entered Syrian territory in the name of the fight against terrorism and would be treated as such.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told the General Assembly.
Moualem has proved that the war on terror is coming to an end soon in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes since 2011.
He declared that Damascus was continuing its holy struggle to clear the entire territory of Syria of terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
2,000 US troops are stationed in Syria, most of them as trainers and advisers to Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
In relation to the refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions were appropriate for their return and that only certain Western countries were fuelling irrational fears, deterring refugees from returning home.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the people return home  he said.
 They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned against providing reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey that creates a zone of conflict around the insurgents' last major outpost, Idlib, could help further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a full-scale attack on the three million-strong region.
Moualem stressed that the agreement would set clear deadlines and expressed his hope that military action would be directed only against jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which must be rooted out.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition representatives will be convened soon to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare for elections.
It considers that the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, subject to certain conditions, such as the revision of certain articles of the current constitution, is acceptable and protects all external actors from interference in the process.
That's why they're going to re-elect Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless he fulfills the hopes of many liberal viewers and ends his presidency ahead of time with a impeachment or scandal.
We can be sure this will be the most dramatic presidential finale of all time.
But for now, the audience is enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN's mainstream viewership has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show is the most watched cable show with an audience of 3.5 million, reaching the top news nights.
"It's like fire, because there's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", in which a low-ranking cabinet minister sits in the presidential chair after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different opinion.
Here's how he quotes a taxi driver from Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
Why? Scovell asked him.
"Because I made you laugh", the driver replied.
It's the fun of chaos.
Unlike the TV series, however, stories from Washington could determine the fate of cases like the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the stability of the global economy.
Only a very narrow layer can make you not care about these facts.
But that's not part of the responsible informing process, when for the sixth hour we're looking at a series of videos about the authenticity of anonymous background conversations that Bob Woodward used in his book "Fear", or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (a dress of arrogance in the words of The Washington Post), or the consequences of Stormy Daniels' description of Trump's anatomy, um,
As far as I'm concerned, from now on, I'll always remember this one about Super Mario.
"It's a little bit like watching a reality show where you get some news every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, founder of the "Holding Stars". "Trump" is a show where the characters are constantly changing and the new twists come every day.
If you miss one part, you're going to miss the next.

She couldn't get away from the TV as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing began at the Senate Judiciary Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.

I thought you were kidding, but it looks like you were right.

Both parties are pouring money into the tightest race in the midterm congressional elections.
No one is surprised that in Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, both parties are spending money countless times after two active members of Congress are running for the same seat after the congressional district was redistributed.
One of the candidates for the newly reborn Pittsburgh suburb is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in a by-election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of Pennsylvania's former 12th congressional district, which shows significant overlap with today's 17th.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January found that the former circuits were manipulated to the Republican advantage.
In the fight for the 17th District, the two parties' funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), almost bid each other for the campaign.
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after he won a close race in the March midterm elections for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The Republican seat has been held for more than a decade, with Donald Trump winning the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador because of China's support, then withdrew from the plan.
Diplomats say the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, to which Washington has barely reacted.
Donald Trump negotiated with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in a good mood in June 2017, and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization leadership team from there.
The State Department has recalled senior staff of U.S. missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over their recent decision not to support Taiwan, the department's spokeswoman Heather Nauert previously reported.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific measure to prevent the use of the drug in the country.
The proposed penal measures, such as the reduction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have affected painfully the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the closed-door meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, with the primary objective of reducing immigration to the United States.
In mid-September, senior officials from the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which made it clear that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It was reported that Vice President Mike Pence would be speaking at a conference scheduled for mid-October, which diplomats say is a clear indication of the administration's importance to the event.
The three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington has not issued any condemnation statements or taken any criminal action.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, have reported anonymously.
Their accounts were also supported by outside analysts close to the administration, who also agreed to speak anonymously.
Historical experience
The next blow could be a special counsel Robert Mueller report investigating whether Trump has obstructed justice in any way... and a number of facts have been released to suggest so.
Mueller's investigation allegedly includes whether Trump's team cooperated with Russia trying to influence the election.
If the Democrats win a majority in Congress, they're probably trying to hold Trump accountable, who may have to face the verdict of his fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are many uncertainties, and Trump's downfall is not inevitable... nor is it for his European allies.
Serious decisions must be made on both sides of the Atlantic depending on how long the fight will last.
In 1938, a number of German officers were ready to shoot Hitler, only waiting for the West to stand with the Czechs in Munich.
The aid was not enough, so there was no way to prevent the bloodshed of the following years.
At such historical turning points, the inevitable development of democracy will either accelerate or slow down.
In America today, we can identify several such turning points.
What are we gonna do if Trump turns down the Mueller investigation by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's chair has been vacant since last year, when, as our paper reported, he suggested that the president's conversations be recorded and suggested that Trump was unfit to hold office.
Rosenstein said The Times was inaccurate in its reporting.
How will we react if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or incomplete and, despite a seemingly credible sexual harassment charge, he is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is, in the midterm elections, are we voting for a Congress that is willing to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy faces a long winter.
I trust that this will not happen, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once sat in the building that served as my embassy.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on a table with the symbol of the swastika on the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how could I be pessimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans, who plays for Rangers, is a confident forward for the Rapid Wien
Rangers are hosting Rapid Wient on Thursday, with a win against Austria against Spanish Villarreal, which could secure them a place in Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to make his debut due to a knee injury in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he feels that based on that result, the Rangers can set more bold goals for themselves.
"It was a great team, a big point, against Villarreal", said the 31-year-old.
We believed we could score a point, and we did.
Maybe we could have scored another goal in the end, but we can't complain about the undecided.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
Thursday's game is another big European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy because they were good enough in their last game, but with our fans behind us, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was a tough year, I got hurt, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We're a good team, the guys are enjoying the game, the training is going well.
I hope that if we give it our best shot, we can put the past season behind us and get some good results.
Many women worry about not saving enough for their old age
The survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of long-term care they wanted, but only a small percentage spoke to their family members about it.
According to a Nationwide survey, only half of respondents discussed with their spouses the expected costs of their care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don't always raise the issue", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
The following is worth doing.
First, discuss with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to care for you properly if you do not tell them what you need in time.
Choose where and what kind of care you want, together with your counselor and family, and these decisions will significantly affect the costs you will incur later.
Hire a financial advisor who can give you useful ideas on how to pay your planned benefits.
Funding can be provided by a traditional old-age insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy that can cover expenses or use your own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources to cover it.
Prepare legal documentation: This cuts off the possibility of a subsequent lawsuit.
Trust a representative, a trusted person, who will act on your behalf in health matters, oversee your medical care, and ensure that everything happens according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
You can trust someone to handle your finances.
This trusted person will make the necessary financial decisions and will pay the bills when you are unable to do so.
Remember the small details: Suppose an elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Keep these data in writing so that they are available at any time.
It's not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it's not who the doctor is that brought Martin in.
What medicines do you take?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance.
A man was shot multiple times with a shotgun in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot several times with an air gun while he was on his way home from his evening program.

His injuries are not life-threatening.
Earthquakes and landslides in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and authorities say the death toll could rise further.
The area's communications network was also damaged, so there has been no word from Donggala government north of Palut, where the 7.5 magnitude earthquake was centered.
More than 16,000 residents had to be evacuated at the pavilion.
Some important information about Palur and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu, the capital of Central Celebes Province, is built on the western coast of Celebes Island, at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
He was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the city's founding when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala Governorate is spread over 300 km along the northwestern coast of Celebes Island.
The population of the administrative region  smaller than the province  in 2017 was about 299 200 people.
Central Celebes is characterised primarily by fishing and agriculture, particularly in the Donggala coastal areas.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the Celebes coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit by a flood several times in the past 100 years.
A flood in 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit West Dungal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes are frequent.
Just a few of the major earthquakes and leaks in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake struck the western coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, triggering a quake that reached 14 countries, claiming a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of the victims dying in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island near Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that killed nearly 700 people on the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake devastated near the capital of Padang, West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high landslide that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface earthquake hits Aceh's Pidie Jaya government, and the panic and destruction that followed reminds many of the terrible 2004 runaway price.
The storm failed this time, but still killed more than 100 residents under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular tourist island in Indonesia; a major earthquake killed 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were razed to the ground, and thousands of tourists were stranded on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, is suspected of domestic violence, preventing domestic violence from being reported, and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Police said.
According to the police report, when a woman's confessor tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention center, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and when asked about his guilt, he said he was not guilty at all.
Palint Three is charged with Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to four years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
In addition, he is charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a one-day jail term and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has run into a lawsuit.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and preventing the reporting of the crime, as well as possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed that the man hit her in the face.
Sarah Palint was also criticized by several veterans' organizations in 2016 when they attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and flooding in Indonesia, Hundreds of victims
At least 384 people have died after a Friday earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a landslide that destroyed thousands of homes.
The systems responsible for electricity and telecommunications have been shut down, and the death toll is likely to rise in the coming days.
The epicentre of the earthquake was near Central Celebes, northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There have been numerous videos on social media about the arrival of the spring.
Hundreds gathered for a celebration on the coast of Palu, when the spring came ashore.
Federal prosecutors have asked for the death penalty for the suspect in the New York terror attack.
New York's federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the eight-man death-row shooting that occurred in New York City, a state that hasn't executed anyone since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov was charged with driving a truck rented from Home Depot into a bike lane on the Lower Manhattan West Side Highway in October, killing several pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight of his victims and intended to cause injury, according to a filing with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.
The document submitted says that the evidence of either of the two charges could justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 offences, including eight counts of extortion murder, which until then were almost exclusively used against organized crime, and damaging and destroying motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claim that the attack required significant planning and deliberate intent and that Saipov carried out the attack in a disgraceful, cruel and inhuman manner.
The complaint is filed with the families of Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, who have suffered pain and loss.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York last asked for the death penalty for a defendant a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last federal case in New York to carry out a death sentence was in 1953, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, expressed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed to have enjoyed doing so.
Saipov said that ISIS videos he watched on his phone gave him the idea for the attack, he's on the indictment.
Police say he asked for an ISIS sign in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipov, said he was rightly disappointed by the prosecutors' decision.
"In our opinion, the actual life sentence for a confession would have been more favorable, the death penalty only prolongs the suffering of all the parties involved in the case", Patton claims.
Saipov's defenders have previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for their defendants.
A Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, at a protest at the Tory conference, announced he was calling on the people's army to fight.
The former head of Ukip said politicians should feel pressure from eurosceptics after a colleague of Theresa May suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, no-chief minister, Peter Bone told the Birmingham meeting that the UK would have left long ago had Farage been Brexit minister.
The pressure within May's party is well characterized by the fact that the conservative Tory has been called to another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
May is seeking to implement the Chequers plan, which requires a continuous debate between Brexit and the Conservatives and the EU.
Despite the negative reactions, his allies say he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels that eurosceptics and Labour can choose between his package or the full chaos.
Bone at the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull said the Chequers deal had to be scrapped.
It suggested that Farage be elevated to the House of Lords and entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
If he had led the negotiations, we would have left already.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I stand by Brexit but I have to settle for the Chequers deal.
He criticized the EU and said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be the servants of others.
We want to bring the laws of our own country.
Bone rejected the assumption that the public sentiment had changed since the 2016 vote: "There is no real basis for the British people to change their mind and want to stay".
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory representative for Brexit, was also present at the meeting and told reporters: "All I ask is that you, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote, the party is unpopular, especially among the activists who work in the field and helped us get into government.
Forget the Chequers deal and watch us.
In a harsh message to May, he added: "Only the prime minister can hold his seat who keeps his word".
Farage told the meeting that politicians should be under pressure not to betray the results of the 2016 referendum.
The trust between us, the people and our politicians, has now been bet .
They want to betray Brexit, and we're here today to preach it, not let them do it.
He addressed the enthusiastic crowd with the words: "I would like our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit to feel the pressure.
We are calling on the people's army to fight to win Brexit and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom an independent, independent, proud country again.
Meanwhile, the Conservatives marched in Birmingham, and held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Some activists raised the flag of the anti-Brexit movement over the weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis has been outraged by the Conservatives for the security flaws in the party's use of the conference opening.
These people said they had an informatics background in a Canada plus plus deal, a no-holds-barred border crossing and a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders.
They're just making fun of me.
There is simply no good Brexit, he stressed.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election, she will consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future Saturday at a public forum in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's been speculation for some time that he might be the next Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was a meeting with voters at the 36th Citizens Forum since Trump took office.
One participant asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded by saying that it was time for women to take part in the reorganization of the failed government in Washington, including the occupation of the highest office.
The person they're looking for in the shooting of Sims at LSU has been arrested.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that they arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department at a press conference at 11 a.m. eastern coast time this morning announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
Earlier, they posted a video of the Friday shooting and asked for help identifying the man seen on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the shooting, which turned out to be fatal Police Captain Murphy J. Paul informed media representatives on Saturday, according to a 247sports report.
He intervened to protect his friend Wayde, and he shot Simpson.
Simpson admitted at the interrogation that he was at the scene, had a gun, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest was unincidental, and the man was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Sheriff's Department.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge and is 6 feet tall, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes closer to the world title after being knocked out by Sebastian Vettel
After Valtteri Bottas qualified better than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a big role in the race.
Starting from pole position, Bottas started well and almost got Hamilton in trouble, as he defended his position in the first two rounds, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, Vettel stood out on the boxing scene, letting Hamilton get caught up in traffic behind the middle of the field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a close action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly let go of the inside curve after moving twice as a defense in the third corner.
Celebrating his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the starting lineup and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led the race for much of the race, as he did not change tyres to reach the finish line quickly and beat Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of a fourth place.
He finally made his way to the boxing circuit in round 44, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not improve his pace, so Räikkönené came in fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was ordered to be released.
The team has done exceptional work to secure the first two places, Hamilton said.
He had a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because the senator insisted that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing new Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly reference Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, only noted that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "disgusting, hateful and liars".
What can happen, and the wonderful thing that's happened in the Senate over the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see the people who are angry, disgusting, disgusting and lying.
When you look at the statements and the leaks, they say, "Hey, well, that wasn't me.
That wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember your answer... you leaked the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't leak it.
Well, let's just stop for a second.
No, we didn't. He added, imitating the senator.
A letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's claims, nor leak his story", Feinstein told the committee in a report by The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as requested.
However, his denial seems to have been rejected by the president, who noted at his meeting Saturday night: "I'll tell you what: his body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual harassment by three women, claiming that the Democrats were using the alleged accusations for their own ends.
They promised to use whatever means they could to regain power.
They can see the ugliness, the disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to the brink of power and control.

Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in a game against Dundee
With a 5-3 win on Saturday in the Dundee relegation play-off, the Dundee Stars were leading the Elite League on Friday to their loss to the Belfast Giants.
Through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants have already gained an early two-goal lead.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home run, then Dwyer restored the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied the deficit at Dundee, then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the win.
This was the third Elite League victory for Adam Keefe's players this season, who beat Dundee 2-2 at Belfast on Friday night.

The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are back in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller lost his life to save hundreds of people on board the plane from the earthquake
A world-renowned air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero who lost his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a major earthquake on Friday struck the island of Celebes, triggering a tsunami.
Strong rains are still visible in the area, and many have been crushed by the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the wildly lit control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palui.
He remained there to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air's flight 6321, which was out of service at the time.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We built a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
Our hearts were broken when we heard the news.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could be in the thousands, according to the country's disaster management organization, and the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are hard to reach.
"The number of victims is expected to continue to rise as many are trapped under the rubble and many have not been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Waves up to six meters high have destroyed Palut, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will deliver aid and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "The ambulances are bringing in new bodies every minute.
There's not much clean water.
The stores were looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the Indonesian head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing with time to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a real tragedy, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the soldiers of the country: "I ask all of you to work day and night on evacuation related tasks!
Are you ready? CNN reporting.
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes on Lombok Island this year, killing more than 500 people.
Air Niugini claims that one person was missing in the lagoon plane crash
A recent report from an airline operating a plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person was missing, although it had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini, the situation on Sunday afternoon is that a man cannot give a number of passengers.
The airline says it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further information about the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events have not yet been clear.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
According to some witnesses, the plane missed its landing path.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was taking off very low.
"This is a terrible thing", Jaynes commented.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to gas up to the bottom of the water until the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the aircrew panicked and screamed, and he suffered minor head injuries.
According to the U.S. Navy, a nearby dock repair crew helped rescue the people and floated them to shore on a floating boat before the plane sank 30 meters [30 feet] below the surface.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst has compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor briefed the defendant on Saturday at the retrial of the man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an information analyst.
He briefed the jury on how he used cell phone records to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received several phone calls from locations where she was with Tellis Chambers the night she died, contrary to the man's earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday, saying he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another controversy was that Tellis said she knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
They only met a week ago based on cell phone data.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"You erased him from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to be heard later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hypocrisyist has summoned a negative view of the art form into the office by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, hip-hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Presenters like The Fugees and Common are again popular in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.

New York City dad sued for firing a couple after a message from a racist
A New York man sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after a misspelled message from the mother complained that they had hired a black woman again.
The couple denies they're racist and liken the case to blackmail.
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when in 2016 she saw her first day of work when her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived.
"I know, but how long has it been?" "Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing that she was being bullied, Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying that the outgoing African-American had done a bad job and was hoping for a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work, then sent home in an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for damages for the dismissal and asking for $350 a day for the six-month residential work they were originally hired for, although without a contract.
"I want to show them to stop the march, you can't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple responded to accusations of racism that Maurice's termination was reasonable because they feared they could not trust him after being offended.
My wife sent him something she didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racists, " her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you trust your children with someone who, even if by accident, was cruel to you?
Your newborn?
Come on, you know what?
Plasco, who likened the case to blackmail, said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you attack someone like that?
It's not a nice thing to do. The investment banker added.
While the legal process is underway, the court of public opinion has already quickly condemned the party on social media, denouncing their behavior and logic.
According to a recently found letter, the publisher of Paddington was afraid that readers would not be able to connect to a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
This is quite amusing information now that we know what a huge success Paddington is.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about toy dolls, would not have resented being rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was a bitter success after her father's death last year.
He called Paddington a very important member of his family, adding that his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
He was a very quiet man, he had no imagination whatsoever.
But since Paddington was almost real to him, he felt like a child who carries something: we're proud of it even if it's not really our merit.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he created it and it sprang from his imagination, he always credited Paddington with its success.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When he landed, he and his daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought in vain for his life.
"She called me regularly to tell me she was in very bad shape and that she was not expected to survive", Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
I just got a call from Nad saying that my daughter is gonna die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly stopped and left her system.
He died before, and then it all stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all over.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the others who did not care about the ordeal she was going through.
No one knew.
I was shaking my head and my tears were shedding all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That she needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.
Picture book with mourning women on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys placed postcards full of inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed, then committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day.
Ms. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising cook and that everyone was fond of his laughter.
He knew everyone by his smile.
They always said that a smile can lift any place.
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was in very poor condition.
Tyler, who was about to end his life by suicide, was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, "I was constantly worried that it would cause some sort of domino effect".
Ms. David created the postcards so people would know that there are people they can reach and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit still. You have to talk.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Ms. Davies's friend for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after the death of the man's mother.
She didn't say she was depressed, depressed, or anything else.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was totally under the weather on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye and stuff.
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with the fact that he left a dangerous mark on the family.
He broke our hearts into little pieces.
But we must continue the fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question as the FBI begins its investigation.
I thought that if we could achieve what he asked for, a limited-time, limited-sized investigation, we might be able to reach an agreement, Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would fall apart because of the party's lack of decision-making.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI's investigation?
Their resistance is only to be understood by timing.
The midterm election is only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans don't do as expected, it's going to be much harder for them to get their man on the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases your report?
The Senate is currently holding a vote, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats seated.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the decision to take Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean dissidents under Kim Jong-un's leadership has been reduced
The number of North Korean dissidents entering South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengszok cited data from the Southern Unity Ministry and said that there were 1127 dissidents in the last year compared to 2011 when this number was 2706.
Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for human traffickers were the main reasons.
Phenjan has not commented on this information publicly.
Most of the North's dissidents eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Dissidents are treated by China as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forced back.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where the focus of their talks was on the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This historic meeting in June came between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on a broad-based agreement on further cooperation on the nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances it is unthinkable that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons", Ri said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "historian" who she thought was unfit for the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claimed that his behavior was not in line with his work on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"It also occurred to me that if a woman ever behaved like this, I would call her hysterical" "it explained Pelosi's reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was passionate about protesting the rumors that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and his voice was still when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also specifically condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated character killing", organized by angry liberals over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was unfit for the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
I think he's ruled out his statements and his behavior against the Clintons and Democrats.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh to account if he filled the position and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"All I'm saying is that if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only not good enough for the Supreme Court, but you're not good enough for the court you're in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Capital Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions about the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as Kavanugh considers himself a conservative judge.
During his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to enter the courtroom and expect us to jump from joy", Pelosi said.
And women have to keep it in their hands.
It's a legitimate rush, a rage that has been building up for months and years, and it can't come out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's so rare, is it?
I had a woman who was a leader somewhere who helped me a lot. She told me that she was crying in her anger, but she developed a technique that when she was crying in her anger, she would say to her partner, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying".
But I'm angry.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea".
Part of the reason they see tears as a sign of anger is that they've been fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of an early job in a men's office, where I once cried in anger and helplessness that an older woman, a cool manager I had always feared, had grabbed me by the neck and led me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to get you upset.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair with a hairdresser named Monkey Business, and dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in her deep frustration, figured out that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision", she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the competition, and they wanted the new candidate in the middle of their back.
Someone called him "the White Horse and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was long running, Ms. Schroeder was behind on the fundraiser, so she vowed not to compete unless she raised the $2 million.
It was a battle that was doomed to failure.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
"You thought I was getting a discount?" she thought.
When he held a press conference not to launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions of gratitude to the people who supported him, and frustration with the system that directly made it difficult to reach voters, and anger at sexism, that his throat squeezed.
"They may have thought I had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder said, citing the press' reaction.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.

How can a US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening sequence of the US-China trade war was almost deafening, and while the battle is not yet over, experts say a break between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warnings earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, as the new tariffs already affect $200 billion worth of products, effectively taxing half of all goods from China to the United States.
Beijing has cut back on every case, most recently imposing tariffs of between five and 10 percent on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has vowed to retreat every time, and the world's second-largest economy will certainly not retreat in the near future.
If you want to persuade Washington to back down, it would mean you have to give up your seat before the demands, but public leaning toward the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Yet experts say that if Beijing is tactically sound, U.S. trade war pressure could benefit China in the long run, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick decision can create conditions in Washington or Beijing that could drive economic turmoil in either of the two countries is far more serious than observers have previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher in Asia at the New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country destroyed by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem claimed that the situation in the country was improving.
The current situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring them to normal conditions.
Now all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to flee between terrorism and the economic measures of self-imposed force that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state would welcome any assistance it could provide to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the USA team in a 16.5:10,5 away from Paris at Le Gold National.
The USA have now failed on the European stage for the sixth time in a row and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its title as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjørn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, American star player who wrestled the entire tournament, threw his punch into the water at the par-3 16th hole, handing the win to Francesco Molinarin.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled at every turn, becoming one of only four players to ever reach a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was dismissed with 5&4 from the lowest ranked player in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have been in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time leading European with 25.5 career points.
I don't cry sometimes, but I couldn't stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to have my trophy back.
It's all about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, a struggling emotionist, after his European victory.
He's handing over the staff to Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2&1 singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 titles, and who's been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who were excellent golfers throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk, after his disappointing performance, said he was proud of these guys for fighting.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Put your hat down before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're moving our team, we're working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You guys need to lift your hats.
The opponent was better than us".
