Case of MG Baltic: new Gustav's lawyer says he has not yet been informed of the case
The 11th hearing of the MG Baltic case on Monday brought all the defendants together: Sharon Gustav, Gintar Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligius Masiulis and Raymond Kurlianskis.
The court hearing began with the indictments.
At the last hearing, the new lawyer of Mr Gustav, Alexander Dorochev, appointed by the state, told the jury that he had not yet been able to read the case file.
At that time, Mr Linas Belevičius, a lawyer for MG Baltic, stated that in order to ensure a full personal defence, the College of Judges must allow the new lawyer access to the case file and requested that the hearing be postponed.
'In order to ensure the defence of the person, he must have access to the criminal case.
It is not just a formal sitting", said Mr Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Dorošev, said that he was not in a hurry to get acquainted with the indictment or the entire case file.
At a previous hearing, the defendant, Mr Gustav, announced that he would resign from his lawyer because he could not pay him.
The session also included audio recordings.
The defendants' lawyers complained that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
The Authority suspects that, following the advice of MG Baltic, the politicians supported or initiated decisions in favour of the Group in the Seimas and other public institutions and also influenced the decision of the winners of public procurement, ELTA recalls.
The secondary survey survey surveyed more than 150 people, including more than 50 former and current members of the Seimas, several former ministers, members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 boxes were conducted.
Mr Gustav is suspected of having received more than EUR 8,000, Mr Steponavičius - EUR 15,000, Mr Gapsy - more than EUR 27,000. Mr Masiulis is suspected of having received more than EUR 106,000.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and influence trading, the Liberal Alliance of bribery, influence trading and abuse, and MG Baltic of buying and trading of these parties.
It is suspected that the politicians consulted the Vice-President of MG Baltic on the dispute and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the Group in the Sejm or other institutions.
Ethics guards: Liberal Conscience Board on the right to behave in Vilnius
"The decisions of the administration are in accordance with the statutes", BNS's head, Vytautas Tamošiun, said after the Commission meeting.
"Our decision was not new.
The Commission's explanation was already made in July when the question of the Pages and Utes was raised.
We then said that by statute, it was a matter of the board's competence.
And if the board decides that a department can do whatever it wants to do, go with the committee and the board agrees, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which the board has adopted, then it's a decision to have all the departments form party lists.
If the Board does not agree, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and go to the committee.'
According to Mr. Tamošiun, the party's board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Liberal Conscience Board of the party annulled the decision of the Vilnius City Council to participate in the municipal elections not with the party but with the newly formed electoral committee list.
The Party's Board of Directors considers that the decision of the capital liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes and the decisions of the Board.
By 31 October, the Vilnius Chapter had to cancel its bid to participate in the municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the department didn't.
Former deputy head of the department, Ms Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal coalition.
The mayor of Vilnius, former Liberal Party chairman Remigijus Šimašus, has already presented the team and ideas of the Public Elections Committee "Už Vilnius, which we are proud of!" to the public, promising to seek another term as the head of the capital.
He left the party too.
Municipal councils and mayoral elections will be held in March next year.
A tiger that had previously killed a man was taken by a tractor from a village in northern India, officials said Monday.
Forestry official Mahavir Kaujlagis said the tiger struck a man working in the fields late Sunday, surrounded the animal by villagers and drove it away in a tractor while trying to escape.
Residents say that the tiger also attacked and stabbed a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of the state capital Lakna.
The tiger is not allowed to breed in protected areas.
The Director of the Guards, Ramesh Pandhai, said that the incident would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh, villagers killed another tiger, who was seriously injured.
The tiger is the national animal of India and is listed as an endangered species under the Wildlife Protection Act.
Last year's government data showed that in the previous three years, at least one person per day was killed in collisions with wild tigers or wild boars.
Human conflicts with tigers have been increasing gradually since the 1980s, when India launched a tiger conservation program that established tiger reserves in national parks and criminalized the killing of big cats.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, the census shows that the then population of around 1,800 tigers increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Proposed mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with microscopic markings
The Chairman of the Environment Committee of the Seimas, Kstustutis Mažeika, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act proposing the mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with underground microscopes.
'We propose that cats and dogs be labelled underground with mandatory microscopic markings and that their registration and labelling be organised by local authorities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Office.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds and in 2020, cats will be marked free of charge, so the population will not be worried and the costs will be covered by specifically provided state funding", said the Chairman of the Seimas Environment Committee, Kęstutis Mažeika.
The amendments aim to address the need for systematic labelling of domestic animals.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is estimated that, according to the expected average price of the microsystem and the service, which will be around EUR 5, all owners of animals will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling all pet animals may be up to EUR 6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to be spread over three years to EUR 2 million per year.
It is expected that the funding for the labelling programmes will be provided through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, which will significantly increase its revenue this year due to increased taxes and redistribution of resources on natural resources.
The municipality will be able to use this money not only for cat and dog labelling but also for castration and other programmes.
According to Mr Mažeik, the practice of mandatory labelling is widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows the animals themselves to be protected (because the animals that have lost their livestock can be easily returned to their owners) and saves the time of the animals themselves when the search for the escaped and the lost animal has to be spent a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with marked pets.
At the same time, the labelling requires the responsible care of the animal throughout its life.
The previous proposals had to be marked with resistance, as the programmes concerned were proposed to be financed from public funds.
'The present model should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to be financed through increased revenue from the environmental support programme and the right to label not only veterinarians but also the public, i.e. persons from animal welfare institutions who have completed special courses at the Veterinary Academy,' say the authors of the project.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas factions - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvil, Edmund Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of the government forces were killed in the Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
A spokesman for the provincial governor, Arif Noori, told the press that seven soldiers and six police officers had been killed.
He added that four other soldiers were wounded in the attack on a joint army and police checkpoint in Chogyani district.
According to Noori, six fighters were killed and 10 more were wounded in the three-hour battle with Afghan forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a press release saying the movement has claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Gaza province.
Noori said the post was set up two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
The post was completely destroyed during the attack.
"Rita" extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
The fourth round of the FIBA Europe Cup will be played on Wednesday at the Vilnius "Morro" arena, where clubs from Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The double is being held in the capital for political reasons.
The club will host the Cherkashki Mavpy and Prishtina teams on November 7 at its roof at the Ryta Arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to host this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to take us in", said Ukraine's head coach Maximas Michelson, thanks to the club.
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so we'll be honored to play here.
We hope to get support from the Wolves.
The Kosovo team was unable to enter Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
The Ukrainian team currently holds third place after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second place and has more wins.
This will be a very important group E qualification, as only two teams will advance to the next stage.
In the past, the Ukraine and Kosovo national basketball teams have also played in Vilnius for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
Then the victory of the Ukrainian team was celebrated in 100:61.
The basketball entrance is free for fans Wednesday, and the two-game start is at 7:00 p.m.
"Women Lie Better" star B. Arsobat is being stalked by liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown actress Brigitte Arsobait has been given roles related to lies several times.
First, the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Legs", and finally the comedy "Legs".
In this film, Brigita plays the handsome wife of the hero of the film, Dainian Kazlausko.
"I liked making movies in theaters because I'm more of a theater actress and I rarely made movies.
A wonderful team of colleagues has promised a great result from the start.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the square was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I've never been attracted to those little, decorative fifi four-pieces.
But during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that sympathy became mutual, and I eventually even tried to buy her from my mistress, but to no avail", she smiles.
The comical and intriguing family members' experiences were absorbed from the first minutes of the new Lithuanian comedy "Melagii", produced by the producers of the Lithuanian film hits "Neutertast" and "Among Us, Boys"... and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov.
Your lover just announced she's waiting.
That would be great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
When parents fail to share the "good news" with everyone, they suddenly declare that they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful holiday of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, because no one expected such a breakthrough.
All heroes are not what they seem at first glance...
In addition to the comedy by B. Arsobaita, the film "Melagii" presents the audience with a good mood by four film stars: Giedrius Savick, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrze Giedratytė, Liubomir Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy Melodies in theaters from November 9th.
Deciding whether to write down EUR 100 million of immigrant unpaid taxes
The Senate on Tuesday adopted an amendment to the Land Declaration Act drafted by the "Land of the People" leader Ramuno Karbauski.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The next hearing on the amendments will take place on or after 6 December, upon receipt of the Government's conclusions.
According to Mr Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for persons who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years a person has not paid about 1,000 euros, and now there are about 100,000.
Social Democrat Algirdas Syss regretted that the Seimas would thus "incite some people to refrain from complying with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be charged.
The Conservative Member of the Health Committee, Antan Matul, noted that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment by paying a small health insurance fee - they are provided with the same services as the residents who pay this fee.
The amendments provide that persons who pay social security contributions in the European Union, European Economic Area or Swiss Confederation and who are exempted from payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania are to be considered as persons who leave Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of SODRA, has previously said that this step will make the lives of emigrants and SODRA's activities easier.
A video posted online about a bear in the wild reveals a serious problem
Filled like a mother's louse that is stuck in a snow-covered slope, the baby is still crawling, falling down, and backing up steadily.
The video received numerous reviews and comments.
People admired the small bear's endurance - it would slide down and climb back to its mother.
He does not succeed at first, but he does not give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video is truly a matter of attention, but it also reveals the threat that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to mention that people's desire to know the wild can sometimes be harmful.
"I'm sure the bear drone was very scary.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone hadn't been flying around, they would have probably chosen a safer route or taken it more slowly or with more caution.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used", ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
A while ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues were investigating how drones work on bears.
The animals were fitted with heart function meters.
As the drone approached, some of them let themselves go, others stopped, but their hearts began to beat more frequently.
Scientists advise animals to use drones responsibly, to fly away, to avoid making noise, and to avoid flying in restricted areas.
The President who was a fugitive was contacted by the newspaper
The Kiev court on Tuesday invited the outgoing Russian president Viktor Yanukovych to attend a court hearing on his alleged treason in an unusual way, the appeal was published in the state's official gazette.
In a court appeal published in the government news paper Uridovoj kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend a criminal trial on November 19 to hear his final arguments.
The document states that Mr Yanukovych is entitled to attend the meeting via video.
On 30 October, the Kiev court declared the proceedings in the case of Mr Yanukovych to be closed.
The Russian lawyer for Mr Yanukovych, Mr Aleksandr Gorochinski, was given the opportunity to register with the Foreign Lawyers Register by 19 November in order to attend a meeting where Mr Yanukovych is expected to make his last statement via video.
The Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maydan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president's refusal to sign an association treaty with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was taken to Russia through a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula, and a war broke out between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists in the east.
Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of some 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting truce.
The list of conservatives will be submitted to Vilnius City Council by Valdas Benkunsk
The Conservative candidate for the year was confirmed a year earlier by former Minister of Agriculture, MP Dainius Kreivys.
During the first election of the Conservatives, party members ranked candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
The party reports that the leader of the conservative list was V. Benkunskas, chairman of the meeting of the Vilnius branch of TS-LKD.
The first decade of candidates included members of the Vilnius City Council Paul Kozmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Bashkienė, former Seimas member Liutaur Kazlavick, the chairman of the League of Young Conservatives Mantas Benkunskas, Aarunas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Limitations on cogeneration plants appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) against the decision of the authorities to pass a law on the possibility of halting the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition party, the Union of Christian Democrats of the Fatherland-Lithuania (TS-LKD), announced that a group of members of the Seimas had asked the CTC to examine the constitutionality of the amendments to the law on waste management adopted by the ruling party.
"Parliamentarians stress that the law aims to challenge the projects of waste incineration plants already underway, by requiring the government to impose new restrictions (20 km from the residential area) before the law enters into force on the waste incineration plants that are being built in Vilnius and Kaunas", the statement reads.
'The MEPs note that, given the way in which the law provides for a prohibition on the construction of waste management sites of national importance (i.e. the establishment of distances and the definition of 'habitable areas') it is concluded that the prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the right to carry out agricultural activities related to the combustion of waste for energy production, the essence of the non-established criteria is to formulate such a structure, taking into account the density and distribution of Lithuanian population in the country, as a whole, as to be practically impossible to build on the territory of the country,' it adds.
The complaint claims that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
'The Court has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and consequences which have occurred before the new legislation enters into force.
In this case, the power to reverse the law is conferred on the Government on the basis of an indeterminate criterion.
The adoption of such legislation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations and, consequently, the constitutional principle of the rule of law.'
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration projects.
The suspension of projects currently underway would not only result in financial losses of hundreds of millions of euros, but also in huge losses for the Lithuanian population, increasing heating prices and increasing environmental pollution caused by the waste disposal in landfills.
The letter was signed by the members of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Alliance, the Social Democrats and the senior deputy of the Social Democrats Labour Party.
A few weeks ago, the Seimas was able to collect 71 votes to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Act, which President Dalia Grybauskaita vetoed, which gave the government the right to halt construction of already started cogeneration plants, and also set a quarantine zone 20 km from residential areas for such plants.
The amendments to the law re-adopted by the Seimas will come into force on 1 January 2019.
This proposal is planned to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the right of the government to halt projects already started is not envisaged.
The Court shall examine the case in the order of succession, not earlier than one year afterwards.
Published questionable statistics on LeBron James at the Lakers
LeBron James's start in the Los Angeles Lakers career isn't what he expected, the organization and the basketball fans.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start helped raise rumors about the firing of potential coach Luke Walton.
But that speech was reassured by Magic Johnson, president of basketball operations, who said he would not let the coach go, but he needed to play better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should turn around and look at himself.
Although the offense's statistics are usually impressive, 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 blocked shots.
But she's not telling the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, there were other numbers showing the Lakers are playing better when L. James is not on the field.
The player dislikes the +/- statistic, which shows how many points a team puts or loses when there are certain players on the field.
Look, with L. James on the court, the Lakers have lost 30 points this season over their rivals.
He's got 19 points off the competition on the floor.
Right now, the Lakers are only in 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few wins can make it all the way to the top.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia's airspace in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly values the cooperation of Spain with NATO and its significant contribution to the security of our country and the region", Minister L. Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO air and air force strengthening missions in the Baltic States, including three in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish Eurofighter was deployed in the North Sea was in May-August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the airspace protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communications in the fight against propaganda were taking place between Lithuania and Spain.
Mr Linkevičius expressed his hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to work closely together on European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since the opening of the Spanish Embassy in Vilnius in 2004, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth Spanish Ambassador to Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented his letters of recognition to President Dali Grybauska.
V. Thank you for the arrest of R. Ach: I believe in the man's innocence and the law
"It was the most unexpected thing I could ever think of.
On the other hand, the service is probably doing the job it's supposed to do.
We're all doing our job.
I trust law enforcement, I trust my husband that everything is right and honest, that no dishonest acts should be committed", said V. Ačienė.
Mr Acz was detained by the Special Investigations Service (STT) on Monday, where law enforcement suspects that while he was the director of the Raseine Municipality administration, he took a large sum of money and could have made a special offer in return to a private company that had signed a contract with the Raseine Municipal Bus Park.
Private companies are suspected of directly buying up Mr Acz or of being involved in masking the assets in various financial transactions.
The Raseins District Municipal Council removed Mr Acz from his post as head of administration in April this year on his third attempt after a lack of confidence in his position.
The former "orderman" became a member of the newly formed Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gedimin Kirkilo in March this year, and he suspended his membership on Monday.
A few years ago, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor as a representative of the electoral committee "Tao Raseiniai".
Mr Aciena says that he had not planned to run for mayor of Raseine next year, but had not yet decided whether to stand for election to the municipal councils.
Ms Acksenė was elected to the Seimas from the list of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union and is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she expects further law enforcement action - depending on whether she resigns from the Labour Committee.
"I'm not really making sudden decisions today, but this week I think I'll make a decision.
I'll see if there's any need to press charges, and I'll make the same or different decision.
I should probably stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, it's time to put everything back in its place", she said.
The opposition Conservative spokeswoman, Radvila Morkuunaite-Mikulinė, urged the Seimas President, Viktor Frankiet, and the "Ladies" leader, Ramuna Karbauska, to distance themselves from the statements of their colleague, Vid Ackenia, and to remove her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, moving her to another Seimas committee or commission.
She argues that Mr Ackney's continued work on the Seimas Anti-Corruption Committee "would create a well-founded public distrust and discredit the important work of the parliamentary oversight committee".
The emotional music of Coldplay attracted and heard the Lithuanian couple
On Monday evening, many music and film lovers are gathering for the pre-release of Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a group of well-known people: John and Simon Naina, Ignas Lely, Martin Tyla, and many others.
The film tells the story of one of Britain's most popular rock bands, Coldplay, which is transformed by moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matt Whitecross met the band's friends while they were still playing in bars and gathering just a few dozen spectators.
The film shows never-before-seen footage from backstage, rehearsal, or leisure.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in college in 1996 and formed the band Pectoralz.
Soon they were joined by bassist Guy Berryman and a little later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to Coldplay and released their first record, "Safety", just 20 years ago, which featured three songs.
Of the 500 copies, most were distributed to radio stations, producers, and friends, and only 50 copies of Safeety were sold.
Now Coldplay is a well-known, respected and beloved band worldwide, having released seven albums that have sold over 100 million copies.
Over the course of two decades, the band has won 107 awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammy Awards.
Juventus winner V. Čepukaitis - MVP of the week
After playing solid matches for Betsafe-LKL, Utena's top scorer, Vaid Čepukaitis, won the title of the most valuable player of the week.
The centre scored a double, which helped Juventus beat Alytus Zhukia's players 86:77 in the extra.
In the 31 minutes played, V. Chekhovitis scored 13 points (5/6 of a double) and returned 11 balls.
In addition, the high-pitched game provoked seven losses, captured three balls and made four successful transfers.
These indicators were guaranteed by 30 utility points.
This season, Chekapoitis is picking at 17.2 points per game, his best career result in his 11th season in the NHL.
The senior is the fourth most valuable basketball player of the season.
Along with V. Čepukaić, Martyn Gecevičius and Kšištof Lavrinović (both of the Prineas "Skycop"), Yannick Franke (the "Star of the Milk" of the Easter Rising) and Jera Grant (the "Neptune" of the Claipeda) were among the top five winners of the week.
Only recently, in a 88:93 loss to Priene's Skycop, the team's new addition, Y. Franke, scored 24 points, returned 10 balls and caused 8 opponents to lose, collecting 31 points.
True, the team's loss did not stop him from becoming the best basketball player of the week.
The defensive line of the fifth with the legionnaire of the Pasval team is made up of his opponent of the day - M. Gecevičius representing the Prine teams.
He scored 19 points and returned nine balls.
These indicators gave the sniper 26 points of usefulness.
Another Skycop player can be seen in the high-level chain - K. Lavrinović scored 15 points (3/4 innings, 9/11) in Sunday's games, provoked the losses of 7 competitors and collected 23 utility points.
On the fifth day, the power match was also played in Vilnius by Claipeda's Neptune striker J. Grant.
The American scored 25 points in 25 minutes (10/11 double), the defensive 4 captured 3 balls and amassed 29 utility points.
Such a legionnaire appearance allowed the capital's cheerleaders to triumph before local morning 78:66.
The highest incidence of influenza in one of the major cities
The incidence of influenza and acute upper respiratory tract infections (ATFIs) decreased nationwide last week.
According to the Centre for Infectious Diseases and AIDS (ULAC), the total incidence of influenza and TIAs in Lithuania for the period 29 October to 4 November was 49.9 cases per 10 thousand inhabitants.
The previous week, this figure was 68.1 cases per 10 000 inhabitants.
At the same time last year, 50.4 cases were recorded in 10,000 inhabitants.
The lowest number of cases, 28,1 in 10 000 inhabitants, was recorded in the administrative territory of Uttara, the highest number of cases, 65,5 in the administrative territory of Kaunas.
Last week, one child was hospitalized for the flu.
Did you see a missing person in the Jonah area?
On October 29, the police in the Jonah area received a report that their family members had been unable to contact Robert Kaldinsky, 48, for some time.
In response to the report, authorities immediately searched the area around Ručićevi and other areas, but could not find the man.
Male characteristics: about 175 cm tall, with a slender body, short light hair, without a beard and mustache.
Anyone with any knowledge of the whereabouts of the missing Robert Kaldinsky or who can provide any relevant information, the police are requesting that the Kaunas area be contacted.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2009.
Palestinian stabbed Israeli soldiers in the West Bank
The war "prevented this attack by identifying a terrorist who tried to stab civilians and an IDF soldier", says an Israeli military release about the incident near the Hebron neighborhood of Kiryat Arba.
"The soldier fired on the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
The Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers were not harmed,' the statement added.
A military spokeswoman told AFP news agency that the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
The video footage from the incident shows him being slightly injured.
A similar wave of Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
Attacks like this have declined in recent years, but there are warnings that a new wave may emerge.
On October 22, a Palestinian was shot dead after stabbing a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron.
The Commission's report calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskaitė called on China to create a more favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries to invest in, and to facilitate conditions for foreign imports.
At the opening of the Shanghai Chinese Import Expo, Grybauskaitė stressed that, given the signs of economic slowdown, the common European and Chinese objective should be to 'join efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world', citing the root causes of the tensions caused by the trade wars, 'surplus production and unfair competition'.
'The European Union is very much aware of China's commitment to create an attractive, open investment environment - an important one for negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here and strengthening intellectual property protection", said Mr Grybauskaite.
According to her, China's opening-up is important not only for Europe but also for the country and for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian manager stressed that investment transparency must be 'beyond the interests of any business group'.
'Clearness, the rule of law, strict compliance with international agreements must be central to the new investment relationship environment,' Grybauskaitė stressed.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our own countries", she added.
The Chinese import show tries to mitigate criticism that it avoids opening its market and only protects its companies.
The exhibition is attended by heads of several countries, with more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China is currently ranked 25th among the export partners.
Lithuanian exports to China increased by 50% last year to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania could bring undesirable political influence, and Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is a threat to EU unity.
Problems resolved: the mobile signature service is already in operation
The Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions, a mobile signature supplier, reports that the mobile signature system malfunction has been resolved and the service is operating as normal.
The mobile signature was restored at 2:28 p.m.
The mobile signature system went down at 9:52 a.m. on Monday.
These losses were suffered by customers of the telecommunications companies Bites, Tele2 and Telelia.
SK ID Solutions has identified the cause of the malfunction but has not disclosed it for security reasons.
The company apologizes to the consumers for any inconvenience.

Lions Air's cause of crash revealed:
The black box data from the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air showed that the speedometer had been malfunctioning on at least four of its last flights, investigators said on Monday.
The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), Soeryanto Tjahjon, said similar rattlesnakes occurred over the last four flights of the aircraft, including the fatal one when the liner crashed into the Java Sea on 29 October immediately after takeoff from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board the plane died in this disaster.
Many media outlets reported the failure of an earlier Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was actually the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane", Mr. Tjahjon told a news conference.
"The black box data showed that the same problem was present on the two flights before the trip from Denpasar to Jakarta", he added.
"There are a lot of rumors on social media.
We now want to clarify that the black box (data left) contains four flights in which there were problems with the airspeed gauge,' said the NTSB Director.
During a meeting with the families of the dead, Mr Tjahjon said that the flight recorder's information matched reports that the aircraft had been disrupted in speed and altitude during the last takeoff.
The task force has not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air stated that it was repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations after a technical failure was detected during the flight from Bali to Jakarta.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to testify by communications minister Budi Karyas Sumadi, who moderated a meeting with family members of the officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains and the investigation into the crash.
But he stood up and nodded when angry and sad family members demanded that Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air in 1999 with his brother Kusnan, turn himself in.
Lion Air was acting badly", said one man who introduced himself as the father of passenger Shandy John Ramadan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island the plane was flying to.
'I want to draw the attention of Mr Rusti Kirana and his team,' he stressed.
- Lion Air has never contacted me since the crisis began.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed no mercy".
After that meeting, Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding any questions from the press.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identification of the deceased.
Nearly 140 body bags of human remains were handed over to medical experts.
Only 14 victims have been identified so far.
The parents asked why the two-month-old liner was allowed to fly after a crash on the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, which caused a sudden crash that scared the passengers.
Lion Air said this malfunction was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved?
- If not, the appropriate technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they didn't say the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond by law so that the plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr. Tjahjon said that the large number of small debris and the fact that the debris spread over a relatively small area suggested that the liner likely crashed into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was intact when it crashed into the sea.
It did not explode in the air and the engines of the plane were operating at high speeds when it touched the water, indicating all the turbine coils that had collapsed", the official explained.
The Lion Air crash is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan, killing 234 people.
Rescuers from the wreckage: Victims and Minors
On Monday evening, on the road from Vėžė to Plungė, BMW and Mercedes-Benz collided on the road from Tilvika.
Cars collided with a catastrophe, reportedly killing three people.
The BMW driver, born in 1999, reportedly drove to the opposite side of the road and the catwoman crashed into a Mercedes-Benz car driven by a father born in 1967 and a daughter born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters.
A Mercedes-Benz girl with her teeth in an accident.
All the victims are to be taken to hospital.
The Presidency: no artificial easing for the referendum
After the House approved the proposal by the legislature to reduce the referendum ban on the current more protective Section 1 of the Constitution, the President has amended the veto, her adviser Mindaugas Lingė says.
"More than half the population voted for the Constitution - that's a requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular the articles in its first section, should certainly be by a majority.
It's not hard to predict that the president would indeed veto", Dalia Grybauskaita, a domestic policy adviser, told News Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic state issues - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty - and therefore reducing the number of votes required to change those articles would create, according to Mr Lingė, a 'negative precedent' and 'an uncontrollable risk'.
"The President believes that no artificial easing is needed, that the referendum itself needs to be prepared, that more dialogue with the people is needed", he added.
The Senate is planning to vote on Tuesday to pass an amendment to the Referendum Act.
It provides that a decision on the first and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution with greater protection is adopted if at least two fifths of eligible citizens agree to it in a referendum.
At present, Articles 1 and 14 of the Constitution can be amended by referendum by more than half of all voting rights holders.
Approximately 2.5 million citizens in Lithuania have the right to vote: half of them would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million.
The proposal was born after the Seimas approved the presidential veto in September on amendments previously passed by Parliament that relaxed the voting requirements for changing the nationality clause of Section 1 of Article 12.
Once the referendum is proposed, the preparations for the referendum on dual citizenship should be reduced to 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are scheduled.
Emigrants who have been granted dual nationality since the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 are currently not eligible, with some exceptions.
The Lithuanian community around the world is seeking dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions the referendum will not take place - not enough people will be able to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are in a bad state and need to be upgraded
The Commission has also concluded that the Commission's decision to implement the measures is not in line with the objectives of the 2014-2020 programme.
The Commission considers that the airport is not a public airport.
'The transport infrastructure in the city is already in a state of disrepair as it was designed for smaller passenger flows.
We must upgrade Vilnius airport - it is not even part of the long-term planning, it is the minimum we must do", Mr Masiulis said at a conference held by the Foundation for the Development of Democracy and the magazine 'The Nation' on Tuesday.
The Minister said that the next decade will be crucial as important projects will have to be implemented: the completion of the Via Baltica, the completion of the Rail Baltica, the construction of the Klaipeda external port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports and possibly the construction of a new airport.
'The next decade will be very important - we have to finish the road, the rail integration, the construction of the outer port in Klaipėda, the repair of the airports, maybe decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must stay up and start projects now that will reach our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years", the Minister of Communications said.
Mr Masiulis repeated that too little money has been spent on road maintenance in recent years.
'The road situation is not improving as there is insufficient funding.
We expect to build new roads, but even the most basic maintenance, such as the highways, is lacking.
We must set the amount that should be allocated to road maintenance if we want to improve the condition of the roads,' said Mr Masiulis.
It stressed that Lithuania's exports of transport services increased by 18,6% this year, with Germany being the largest export market, overtaking Russia.
Mr Masiulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers be required to periodically return lorries to the country of registration.
'We must make sure that our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
I think the idea of the wolves coming home all the time is absurd because empty trucks in Europe would burn fuel and increase emissions.
The railways will benefit the most, as the costs will increase to the point that some of the transport will be transferred to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions", said Mr Masiuli.
According to the Ministry of Communications, 12,2% is generated in the transport sector.
the gross domestic product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs more than 118,000 people and operates more than 7,500 enterprises.
Dispute with heirs
Last week, Mr Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had begun negotiations on the cultural change of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), called Mr Masiuli's considerations political pressure.
According to him, the building, built in the 1960s, is a listed building, registered in 1993, and it is not for politicians but for experts to decide on its demolition.
Mr Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
"The removal of this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step in order to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that when you enter Vilnius you feel like you are in a modern country, not in an interesting one that really does not represent our country as innovative", said Mr Masiulis last week in the Sejm.
Mr Masiulis also informed at the time that a completely new passenger terminal and an airport to be connected to the railway of Rail Baltica by an underground station were planned to be built in Kaunas.
This transport hub is expected to be operational by 2026 after the completion of the Rail Baltica line.
The airport served approximately 3,7 million passengers last year, 4,8 million this year and 5 million next year.
The airport of Kaunas served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.
What are the Lithuanian troops doing in Afghanistan?
The SNS shall provide the tasks they perform.
In total, almost 50 Lithuanian troops are serving in Afghanistan.

Direct flights to Madagascar from Vilnius will start next year
The main regular passenger plane Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius airport next spring, flying passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bė in Madagascar, according to information from tour operator Itaka Lietuva, according to the website madeinvilnius.lt.
It is announced that Blue Panorama airlines will allow passengers to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominik Milowski, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that Lithuanian tourists are trying to offer new and new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
The Commission has also established a new package of holiday destinations for the summer 2019 season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana, Albania.
Minister of Finance on a potential crisis: the importance of not getting sick
"We must always prepare for difficult times.
What I want to celebrate is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuanian history, we are accumulating reserves.
But it is also important not to get sick", said Mr Shapoka in Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister of Finance Migli Tuskienė will attend the meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting will discuss issues related to the taxation of digital services.
The new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
It is proposed that, in the short term, an agreement be reached on how to tax the revenue generated from the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States until an agreement is reached at global level.
The Euro Group will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as not complying with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the Commission has taken advantage of this opportunity.
More information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss the issues of deepening economic and monetary union: the possibilities for implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian labour traditions and customs
It has been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural photographer, ethnographer and landscape painter Balio Burač (1897-1972) in Sidari, Šiaulėni countryside, then Šiauliai governorate.
As we mark the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to recall how the national revival in life has called on many Lithuanians, including the brothers Buračus - Balí, Jon, Bronski - to engage in the cultivation, enshrinement and preservation of our cultural traditions from the very depths of the countryside.
For more than 50 years, White Burrows has traveled the country with a camera in his hand, providing a broad and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing cultural heritage of the nation and had a rare ability to appreciate the lasting value of his work.
In Bali Burac's photographs, Lithuanian landscapes, castles, everyday and festive environments are embellished by our people in national costumes, which adorn the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication presents a substantial part of Bali Buraç's legacy, dedicated to the description of national labour customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material advertised shows not only the uniqueness and beauty of these traditions but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite the two world wars and the heavy occupation.
The book contains a very rich account of the work, festivals and other traditions and customs of the inter-tribal Zemaitians, especially the Kubics, the Sioules, the Telsis, and the people of Autaitia and Dzukuia.
The magazine has selected from the approximately 10,000 negatives that have been preserved in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished photographs, grouped by text.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture of the Kubiceans, the Zhukas, and other regions of Upper and Lower Jutland.
The suspect, who escaped from a police car in Panevėžys, was held for four hours.
How a young man (born 1994) managed to escape from a service car is still unreported.
He was brought to the custody on suspicion of theft.
At about 4 p.m., police released a photo of the fugitive and asked the public for help: "Dalius Malacous, a stockbroker suspected of stealing a service car, escaped.
The man ran away with his underwear.
If you see this person, please contact 112 or 8700 60000.
It's added.
The time is 5:35.
The police department reported: "The suspect in Panevėžys is facing another case of attempted escape.
Thank you all for your help.
Tragic couple's fate: Died within hours of marriage
A couple who had just married a few hours earlier had died in a helicopter crash in the southwest of Texas.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, were killed shortly after midnight on Sunday when a helicopter crashed into a mountain 16 miles northwest of Juvail and 129 miles west of San Antonio, local justice of the peace Steven Kennedy said.
Strangely, the crash occurred about 15 miles [24 km] away, the same age as the young drivers.
The helicopter pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The bridesmaids attended Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They were married Saturday night at the Byler family ranch near Juvaland and took off in the family's helicopter after the wedding.
The helicopter crashed about 15 miles [24 km] away.
The brides flew to St. Anthony International Airport, where they were scheduled to board a plane and fly for a honeymoon, Kennedy said, not specifying the final destination for the couple.
"It's a very rocky, uneven terrain, and the hill is about 120 to 150 feet high", said Kennedy.
Mr. D. Lawrence has been a pilot on the family's planes for many years.
According to Kennedy, he was a helicopter pilot and served in Vietnam.
The autopsy should reveal the pilot's physical condition and whether she could have been the cause of the accident.
The helicopter crashed about 5 to 10 minutes after takeoff.
His fall was radiated by a broad beam on a rocky hill slope and his body remained "dangerously agitated", flight safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told a news conference on Monday.
Investigators are going to get the landings and then go through them thoroughly, but it won't be easy for the truck to get there, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been established and the preliminary NTSB report should be published in two weeks.
Israeli prime minister calls new sanctions on Iran a "historic day"
"Today is a historic day", Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party, his office said.
"Today is the day that under President Donald Trump, the United States imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran in the entire time that efforts have been made to curb its aggression", the Israeli head of government said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would strike a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the toughest sanctions ever", came into effect after Trump's controversial decision in May to withdraw from the world powers' nuclear deal with Tehran.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about 1 million barrels per day since May, and to disconnect Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says that its scope and deadline are too limited.
The Jewish state also claims that the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to finance its own militant groups and military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has vowed not to allow it to establish itself militarily there.
Other parties to the Iran deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the US decision, saying the deal, as planned, has so far not prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court is again investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a young motorcyclist
In the case that ended with the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, a northern city, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
The Vilnius District Court ruled on Tuesday that, in order to determine all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses will be heard at the next hearing on 26 November.
The case has already been declared a verdict, but the prosecutor's office disagrees.
On August 22, the Vilnius Municipal District Court acquitted the driver of the motorcycle accident that resulted in the death of the motorcyclist, after declaring that the 79-year-old Eduard Osipov was speeding and had committed serious injuries.
The Vilnius District Attorney's Office asks the district court to annul the judgment of the district court and claims that Mr Osipov is the most guilty party to the accident and that the district court's findings are unfounded.
The family attorney for the deceased motorcyclist also called for the annulment of the verdict.
The accident occurred on 11 August 2015 at around 3 p.m. when a Skoda Fabia driven by Mr Osipov from Lakiny Street entered the Žirminy Street and collided with a motorcycle driving on the main road.
The prosecutor accused the man of violating the traffic rules of the road and causing the accident, which killed a man on a Piaggio motorcycle on the main road.
Initial police reports indicated that the motorcycle driver died, but later investigations revealed that the vehicle was powered by a motorcycle.
Vilnius District Court Judge Roland Buzynski told BNS that experts found that the motorcycle rider was traveling at a speed of 89.2 km/h, although the speed limit in that area is 50 km/h.
"The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would be moving at such a high speed", the judge said.
The driver of the car, who was of age at the time, claimed to have driven only five to six kilometers an hour.
The motorcycle driver, seeing the obstacle, tried to stop and fell from the vehicle before colliding with the Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that Osipov had to give way to a motorcyclist who was driving from the side of the road to the main road.
The New Gazette: Six Wagner employees killed in Syria
The dead included five soldiers of the Syrian Armed Forces and six people belonging to the Wagner military company.
This is reported by a source in the Syrian newspaper Novaja Gazeta.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Army Corps is deployed in the area, which is joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and 'military mercenaries'.
Novaya Gazeta has sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry for information on the fate of the Russians.
The former king of Belgium will have to take a paternity test
This decision is part of the artist's Delphic Boel victory.
She has been seeking recognition as the child of the former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II had an unbreakable romance decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies his birthright.
According to the station's RTBF, he could appeal to the Supreme Court against DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, the ex-husband of Delphi's mother, is neither biologically nor legally the father of the artist.
Delphine applied for the investigation in order to be considered the 'real' daughter of her father, Albert.
The CCP will give the parties money, but not the social workers.
The Electoral Commission (EC) is planning to allocate almost €3 million to the major political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), founded in the spring of this year, led by Parliamentary Vice-President Gedimin Kirkilo, has not yet received any budgetary allocations.
However, they may be allocated in the near future by a separate decision of the CCP if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaite, Chair of the CPC, informed the Ministry that 'a meeting of the Commission is scheduled for Thursday to decide on the allocation of the half-yearly budget to the parties'.
According to her, the RCC must decide on this matter by 15 November.
The seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are to receive a total of EUR 2,751 million.
The opposition Christian Democrats of the Union of the Fatherland-Lithuania should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Union of States and Greens - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democrats - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Party - almost EUR 0.4 million, the Labour Party - without a faction in the Sejm - about EUR 0.23 million, the newly-joined Justice and Order Party - almost EUR 0.22 million, the ruling and opposition party - about EUR 0.18 million, represented in parliament but not in the elections - the Christian Families Union.
Under the current law, which will be administered by the CCP, grants for the allocation of budgetary funds shall be granted to parties which meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the recent elections to the Seimas, to the municipal councils and to the European Parliament.
The current legal framework therefore does not allow the LSDDP, which was set up in the spring of this year, to expect to receive money from the budget.
Because this party has not participated in any elections yet.
The governing coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers can get at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the next year's three elections - municipal, presidential and European Parliament.
The Parliament adopted the relevant amendments to the Political Parties and the budget legislation for this year.
The Senate has not yet decided on the veto, but the ruling party's representatives, Mr Kirkyl, and the farmer-green leader, Ramunas Karbauskis, say MPs will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible before this Thursday's meeting of the CPC, and therefore, according to Matjošaitytė, 'the allocation of the donations will be made in accordance with the legal order which has been in place up to now'.
The Chairperson of the CCP did not deny that if the Seimas were to reject the presidential veto this week or next and new amendments to the budget allocation to parties were to enter into force, the Commission could consider a decision on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account the entire legal environment in place in this decision, as we are the executive authority, which has to implement the laws adopted", she said.
If the Seimas were to veto and new laws were to come into force, the additional money would be allocated to the parties by the Government, which would have borrowed the corresponding sums.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko: The ordering of the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I want to state that no version - more than 20 today - will be rejected.
Each will be subject to a very thorough examination in accordance with the investigative procedures.
As president, I have no right to and need not obtain information that could harm the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and law enforcement authorities must operate effectively.
Only in this way will the truth be known and the evil punished", Poroshenko told a meeting with the youth in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in the investigation of the murder of K. Handziuk and that the killers, organizers and contractors of the crime "assume the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been converted to murder, they are rightly and reasonably facing life imprisonment", the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called for the public to investigate the case openly and impartially.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by law enforcement officials in Parliament should show that 'the authorities are determined to hold criminals and murderers accountable, whoever they are'.
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would further confuse it.
"I call on all, and the government and the forces supporting the opposition, not to waste their time with unfounded arguments and, God willing, not to use this murder for public relations", the president said.
- Instead, we must now unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast and that it builds public confidence.
We just don't have a choice".
"No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilize the situation in the country", he assured.
In July, anti-corruption activist K. Handziuk was attacked and acid-treated in Cherson.
She was an advisor to the mayor of this city in southern Ukraine.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.
After the police and prosecutors were not able to identify the perpetrators of the attack, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuri Lukenka, resigned on Tuesday.
After her death, authorities were accused by public activists of failing to conduct an investigation properly.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"Today I am resigning", Mr Lucenka told the Members of Parliament, reading his report on the investigation.
Parliament must still approve the resignation of the Prosecutor.
Lucenka accused the activists of pressuring the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the culprits for Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates has a toilet without water.
In introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional toilet facilities to water-free to the computer revolution of the 1980s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet at a show in Beijing that doesn't need a water hose, Reuters reported.
The water-free toilet operates on the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste are processed into chemical fertilizers.
"The technology you see here is the greatest health breakthrough in the last 200 years", said Bill Gates, quoted by Bloomberg.
The tech toilet was built with funds from a charitable foundation that Bill Gates and his wife Melinda founded.
Over the course of seven years, the project to convert human waste into fertilizer or water cost the foundation $200 million.
In all, according to Bill Gates, there were about 20 toilet models.
The equipment is now complete and available for sale.
But to make these toilets mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is willing to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, poor health causes 500,000 children under the age of five to die each year worldwide.
The fight against poor health problems such as cholera and others is increasing health spending to $233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates presented a glass of feces to the toilet.
He says that this is a good reminder that a small sponge "may contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 infectious disease-causing bacteria, 100,000 worm parasite eggs".
S. Slyva elected President of the Football Association
On 5 November, a special meeting of the Lithuanian Football Association was held in Kaunas, where Sergei Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
Following the request of Anatoli Stechenko to resign as President of the Association, an extraordinary general meeting of the members of the Association was convened.
It was attended by 13 members out of 15.
The main issue on the agenda was the election of a new president.
Two candidates were elected: Sergei Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenes.
Eleven members of the association voted for S.Slyva, two members voted for V.Rasten.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of the Financial Regulation.
Concern in France: Deaths of people are a concern
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on the widely used pesticide, following concerns over several dozen recent poisonings in the west of the country.
The ANSES Health Protection Agency announced that the decision to ban all products containing methamphetamine was taken after a new safety check, which began earlier this year, at least three days before the onset of the poisoning waves in the departments of Maine and Loire.
The government had already suspended the use of pesticides in these cases.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not come into contact with plant or farm workers.
For the product to be effective, it must be used in large quantities.
In France, about 700 tonnes of this was used annually.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Anje region, where saltwater is grown, complained of eye and throat problems, respiratory problems.
"These episodes confirm the validity of our decision, but they did not speed it up", Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told Ouest France on Monday.
Metham is one of the most common pesticides in the United States and Europe, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has listed it as a "likely human carcinogen".
This pesticide, marketed under the names 'Vapam' and 'Sectagon', is authorised in Europe until 2022 when a new safety check is required.
"There was no choice but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives", Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the challenges for salad dressers, for farmers in general, but public health is more important", she said.
Farmers have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of methane in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
This region near Nantes produces more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salted juices consumed annually in Europe.
Next season there will be "much less salad dressings, pickles and pairs", the government said last month, after suspending meth use, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes Farmers' Federation, told AFP.
EUR 70 million was invested in the overview centre in Tallinn
A new T1 shopping centre will open in the Estonian capital this weekend, in which the local real estate development company Pro Kapital Grupp has invested EUR 70 million.
The development announcement states that the total area of the shopping centre, which will cover 130,000 sqm or 55,000 sqm of rental space, will include 150 shops and more than 30 cafes and restaurants.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius Acropolis (including the area of the offices) is about 110,000 sq.m.
'T1' is the first shopping centre with a roof-mounted view wheel, according to the developer.
It will start operating early next year.
In addition, international transport ports will be integrated into the territory: tram services will be available, and intercity buses will soon be available.
The main terminal of Rail Baltica is also located nearby and is projected to serve 1 million passengers per year by 2026.
Paul Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Group, says that the global shopping centre business is undergoing a major change and that the development of T1 has been able to take the lead.
"We've created a new generation of shopping malls that provide emotions and experiences that are not accessible online.
It is a popular attraction in the city centre, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and noteworthy place to visit, and at the same time a quality time with friends or family", Michelozzi said in a press release.
A focus on entertainment
According to the Trade Centre Manager, T1 also has the largest leisure and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
The total area of the entertainment facility is 12 000 m2, or one fifth of the total area rented.
A distinctive accent is a view wheel mounted on the roof.
He will lift his guests to a height of 120 meters above sea level - only a TV tower in Tallinn.
The company claims that the Super Skypark Shoe Park will be on the fourth floor following the review round, opening the largest shoe centre in Europe and the first basketball and networking shoe pitch in Estonia.
In the interactive SkyLAB Research and Discovery Centre, children are promised at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also feature a 360-degree 4D panoramic cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema in the six halls, visitors will also be able to experience a virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
Along with the visual effects and the motion-picture chairs, the sense of reality will be enhanced by the effects of wind, rain or snow, and the choice of scents, smoke or smoke in the theater.
The extension is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenue by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors, according to the extension.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on Nasdaq Baltic and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group received EUR 1,8 million in sales revenue in Lithuania and suffered EUR 350,000 in losses, according to the Pro Kapital Group financial report.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor in the form of a market economy investor.
The T1 shopping centre was built by Merko Ehitus, an Estonian company.
Cameroon's President Paul Biya is sworn in for his seventh term after a controversial election
During a ceremony presided over by Parliament Speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old Mr Biya pledged to preserve the "unity and unity" of the West African nation.
The oldest African president to lead his country for 35 years was declared the winner of the election on October 7 with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the election was overshadowed by low voter turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of the inauguration of Mr Biya, 79 pupils and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted at a Presbyterian school in the North West region where English-speaking separatists are waging an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million people speak French and a fifth speak English.
In 2016, the North West and the neighbouring South West provinces began to demand autonomy following discontent over alleged discrimination in the areas of education, justice and the economy.
In 2017, after refusing to abdicate, the Radicals declared an independent state, the Ambassador's Republic, and raised their arms.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces have been killed in separatist attacks and government counter-offensives this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some of them across the border into Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in the forest.
In October, only 5 percent of the voters in the Northwest Region voted, while 15 percent of the electorate in the Southwest Province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya received two thirds of the vote.
Conservative primary election: mistakes caused by inexperience
"There was something missing in places, you'll see, the party was organizing everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed their premises to be used, but there were no polling stations everywhere because we couldn't afford them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent", the politician said.
According to him, the complaints were received but their content remained essentially unchanged and the infringements themselves were not malicious.
"There was a struggle.
Not all people who participated in the elections had experience - they had news of it too.
So from that inexperience, not all of our actions were in line with our order.
Therefore, the GOC had to warn that the principles we have described were to be respected.
These complaints are not a basis for doubting the results", said Anushauskas.
According to the Chairman of the CRC, there have been cases where ballot papers were unsealed - the unsealed ballot papers found in the ballot boxes were cancelled on learning of this.
Some campuses were short of seats, but according to Anushawsk, complaints and violations were related to several dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is a few thousand, it certainly does not make a significant difference to the election results", Anuschauskas explained.
The party's electoral activity is said to have reached 55%, while non-party voters have reached 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people on the committees.
The results announced on Sunday also remained the same: 79 percent of the electorate voted for Ingrid Simonita (16,418 votes), while 21 percent voted for Vygaud Ušack (44,41).
On 17 November, the TS-LCD Council formally endorsed Mr Simonita's candidacy in the country's presidential election in May.
Trump says he's not likely to meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton earlier said Trump would meet with Putin in Paris, where events will be held this week to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But on his way to his final rally ahead of the US midterm elections, Trump told reporters he wasn't sure if this would be a good opportunity to meet the Russian president.
"I'm not sure if we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not", the president of the United States noted.
However, the White House chief added, they will meet at the G20 summit and "likely meet many times" afterwards.
Trump continues to seek to "overhaul" relations with Moscow despite suspicions that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.
The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that the Commission's decision to revoke the ECSC decision is unfounded.
Former Director General of Vilnius University's Santara Clinics, Kęstutis Strup, has requested the annulment of the decision of the High Commission for Ethics in Employment (HECO) which recognised that failure to declare the transactions in time was in breach of the law.
Mr Strup's complaint was heard by the administrative court of Vilnius on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant asks for the annulment of the judgment of 23 May by the ECJ, the BNS reported to the Court by Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
Mr Strup considers that gifts to relatives should not be declared, and he claims that he understands the exception to the rule.
In May, the ECSC announced that the then-dismissed Director-General of Santara Clinics, K. Strup, and the Head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation at Vilnius University Hospital, Silvija Strupienė, had violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation showed that four transactions were declared on default: a loan from a bank with a spouse in 2010, a purchase of securities from a bank in 2017, a gift from a daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan from a natural person with a spouse that was not repaid in 1996.
Strupien also declared these transactions on expiry of the deadlines.
Persons who have violated the Law on the coordination of public and private interests in the public service cannot be promoted for a year.
The law requires the declaration of not only personal data but also of the spouse.
The investigation was carried out by VTEK on the basis of information provided by Info TV.
In the event of a failure to comply with the requirements of the provisions of the Treaty, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2009.
According to Info TV, last year, K. Strup gave his daughter a property worth €125,000.
However, the former head of Santara's clinics and his wife did not mention the above in their declarations of interest.
Law enforcement has filed a corruption investigation against Mr Strup and at least 10 others, alleging that law enforcement is covering up the fraudulent financial compensation it claims from companies for the purchase of public computers and clinical software.
Mr Strup is thus suspected of consulting at least five times in public procurement in the field of information technology at Santara clinics.
Mr. Strup himself denies his guilt.
Professor K. Strup, a suspect in corruption, was fired as head of the Santara clinic in September.
The Ministry of Health and Vilnius University decided that the participants of the Santara clinic should terminate their working relationship with Mr Strupovi at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Professor Juozas Raistenskis will continue to be the interim head of the Santara clinics until the new general director's competition, which is expected to be announced later this year, is held.
L. Gutauskus - The President of the Republic congratulates him on the occasion of his anniversary
According to the country's leader, L. Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values, into the totality of art, opening up the wisdom and memory of a thousand years of the nation.
The author's beloved and appreciated works - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, book illustrations - testify to L. Gutausk's being an award-winning artist of diverse talents.
In congratulating the honourable anniversary, the President thanked the artist for his significant works that enriched Lithuania and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools already want to teach differently: they promise fewer tests, more practice
The Ministry of Education and Science is planning such changes in educational content, which were announced on Monday at the Forum on "Change in educational content: foreign experience for Lithuanian solutions".
In the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said that over 30 million euros had been invested in updating educational content over the past decade, but no results were seen.
"According to the results of the PISA International Student Achievement Survey, student achievement is below the OECD average", said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The OECD expert, Philo Lambert, quoted in the Ministry of Education and Science report, said that Lithuania was too focused on knowledge provision rather than on the practical application of knowledge.
He said that while education programmes in Lithuania focus on educating pupils in a literate, critical way of thinking, respect and responsibility way, they also need to foster children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
In presenting the changes in the content of general education, Deputy Minister of Education and Science Gražvyd Kazakevičius said that the number of programmes updated this academic year will be smaller, more specific and more interconnected.
According to the Deputy Minister, the education of pupils will be more individualized, schools will become more autonomous - they will be allowed to prepare between 10 and 30% of their unique educational content, the current system of assessment of pupils will change to a cumulative score, greater weight of skills and informal learning competence.
Small standardized tests.
The overall education programmes are committed to a digital, user-friendly, e-resource-related task bank.
The aim of updating the educational content is to improve student achievement in the international PISA survey by at least 10%, to reduce by a third the gap between student achievement, students' current competencies in school, and writing in different fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7,8 million from the European Union and the State budget for updating educational content from May 2018.
It is expected that the project of general education programmes updated for the 2019-2020 academic year will be tested in part in schools and implemented in all schools from September 2021.
The Ministry was criticized in early October for the renewal of the almost €8 million project run by the Education Development Centre for the general programmes of primary, secondary and tertiary education.
The first EUR 1.3 million purchase, which was announced in early October, was for the purpose of finding developers for training programmes.
The acquisition was suspended, and the Minister of Education and Science, J. Petraskienė, dismissed Giedriě Vaidelí, Director of the Centre for the Development of Education, after criticising the experts.
- Exercises in Lithuania on how to respond to extreme flooding
Lithuania is starting a 10-day exercise on Monday to improve the response of the authorities to extreme floods.
As reported by the Fire Protection and Rescue Department (FRAD), the exercises will examine the state's preparedness to operate in the country following a state-level emergency such as a flood: to eliminate its effects, coordinate the search, rescue and emergency evacuation of people from the occupied areas, organise their supply of drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and provide other means of protecting the population.
The exercise will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions and members of the emergency operations centres of 12 municipalities.
The preparatory exercise phase will take place from 5 to 13 November, during which the municipality, having received information from the Hydrometeorological Service of the PAGD on the continuing falls and the flooding, will take decisions on emergency management.
The active exercise phase is planned for 14-15 November.
The State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the department and the State and municipal authorities will operate the emergency operations centres of the authorities.
Following the declaration of a state-level emergency to the government on the effects of the floods, the Chief of Operations, appointed by the Prime Minister, will lead the response to the emergency, its effects, the protection of the population and property and rescue operations.
Mindaugas Kanapickas, Deputy Director of the WFD, said that the main focus of the exercises was to check the readiness of the authorities to carry out the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities for exchanging information, to check the readiness to warn and inform the public, public and municipal authorities, bodies and businesses about the threat of disaster and to "improve the emergency management skills of public authorities".
The exercise will also demonstrate the combined capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters-rescuers to pump large volumes of water from the surrounding areas.
The BalticFloodCombat module was established in 2009 to this end.
Resignation of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuri Lukenka
Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka announced his resignation on Tuesday in the country's parliament over the resonances caused by the death of acidified anti-corruption activist Katerina Gandziuk, according to the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
Under Ukrainian law, the request for resignation must be submitted by the Prosecutor General to the President of the country, who must submit it to the Supreme Council for approval by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General J. Lucenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into the murder of K. Gandziuk to the Supreme Council.
In a speech to parliamentarians, he described the investigation as effective but expressed his anger that Gandziuk's death was being exploited by politicians for public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of Cherson in southern Ukraine.
On July 31, an unknown assailant, K. Gandziuk, sprayed acid in her face near her home.
On November 4, she died of her injuries in hospital.
Protesters at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry demand an answer on the murder of Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix quoted.
According to Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation has identified 12 people who may be involved in ordering the murder of K. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
The Attorney General said the leak gave the suspects essential information.
Mr. Lucenko added that he knew Mr. Gandziuk personally and was angry that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"In order that no one should have any reason to say that someone has taken up power, I would like to announce that I am resigning.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to discuss it in Parliament,' the Obozrevatel newspaper quoted Lukenko as saying in the Council.
Lucenko is reported to have added that "two-state rule cannot be allowed in a country where the law enforcement system is broken without any evidence, even for crimes exposed".
Mr Lucenko is considered a close associate of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on 12 May 2016 following protracted attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, who was suspected of covering up corruption in senior officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy J. Vačiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
The Commission will also consider the possible possible use of the new energy efficiency measures to reduce the risk of greenhouse gas emissions.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a new energy policy for the renewable energy sector in the framework of the European Energy Strategy (EEA).
The Commission considers that progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including the relatively high cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), with electricity playing a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas has begun proposing that the corruption investigation be supplemented by the Conservatives' appeal to the CCP
The Seimas on Tuesday approved the proposal, which it registered for an investigation into illegal influence on political processes led by 'Aunt Agnes Shirinskine'.
There were 58 members of the Seimas in favour, and nine MPs abstained against 27.
The draft will be considered by the Seimas committees, headed by Mr A. Širinskienė, who is appointed as the main member of the Law and Order Committee.
On its conclusion, a vote will be held to approve the amendment.
The Seimas Interim Commission of Inquiry, which is currently conducting a new political corruption investigation, has been asked to explain the possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
Mr Shirinskina proposed extending the deadline, stating that 'significant information has emerged in the public sphere on the potential illegal influence and impact on political processes and public institutions'.
A. Širinskienė's draft lists 'the possibility of representing the interests of pension funds in legislative processes or appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempting to influence the decision-making processes of such important independent institutions as the High Commission for Labour Ethics'.
The opposition Conservatives have launched a lawsuit against the Constitutional Court on pensions.
The 'government' found that the Conservatives relied largely on the arguments of lawyers for private pension funds in their appeal.
Influenced by the Senior Commissioner for Ethics, the "state" leaders blame former colleague Povil Urbsh.
According to them, the former Chairman of the State and Municipal Governance Committee of the Seimas could have ordered the members of the VTEK to dismiss the former head of the Prevention Division of the Commission, Mindaugas Siaur.
At the end of September, the Seimas set up a commission to examine the possible illegal influence of interested persons or groups, the impact on the electoral process, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary factions, individual politicians, the activities and financing of parties and social movements, legislative processes, the appointment of managers of state-owned enterprises, public bodies, members of the management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to examine the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities and their response.
The researchers should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
During this time, there will be a presidential campaign for the European Parliament.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are representatives of the 'country authorities'.
It also appoints two social workers, one 'white', a liberal and a representative of the Polish electoral action - the Union of Christian Families.
The Conservatives and the Social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
The new investigation was initiated by the President of the ruling Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, Ramunas Karbauskis.
According to him, the investigation of the National Security and Defence Committee (NSDC) conducted at the last session on essentially the same issues showed that further investigation is needed.
Head of the German Interior Intelligence has been dismissed
The 55-year-old H.G. Maassen has added to the controversy by saying that Merkel's "radical left" coalition is to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post as promised earlier, but was forced to go into storage.
In addition, it emerged last weekend that at a meeting of representatives of European domestic intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, H.G. Maassen had criticised Merkel's "needy" immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, a longtime defence of the intelligence chief, said at a press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "personally disappointed" him.
Seehofer, himself under pressure both over the dispute and over his party's poor showing in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release H.G. Maassen into custody.
The island was terrorized by a massive shark attack, and the third man was already on trial.
The Queensland Emergency Department said that the victim suffered "serious leg and ankle injuries" in an attack near Sid Harbor, a seaport on the Sequoia Islands off the coast of Queensland.
The man was taken to the hospital by helicopter.
The island of the same name is the largest of the archipelago's objects, attracting many divers and divers from around the world.
Gun attacks in this region have been relatively rare so far.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last shark attack before the last of the attacks took place in this island in 2010.
The CPC has two new members, Visconti and Pux
Mr Puks was nominated by the Lithuanian Bar Association to be a member of the CCRC.
He will replace the D.A.R. withdrawn delegate from the Justice Society's Dream Bowl.
Judge E. Visconti was proposed to the members of the CCP in the light of the party's statement 'Order and Justice'.
The party had no representative in the CPC when Donat Laurinavičius resigned.
In the secret ballot, Mr. Pux's candidacy was supported by 74 members of the Sejm, 5 against, 6 abstaining.

The skin of a girl destroys stereotypes about wedding dresses
A skinny girl in a white robe of wedding dress - mission impossible?
Can a white sailboat flying toward the altar be larger than S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the reality show "Evolve the Big (r) " will prove today that the beauty and elegance of adventure really does not depend on a woman's kilograms.
But that's not all. One of the girls on the project will shed tears of happiness tonight, and her boyfriend will appear on the set.
"Some still think that older girls don't get the attention or the looks of men.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me the way I am, he doesn't expect me to be a figure of some sort that meets the standards", says Aurika, a contestant in a wedding dress, before her performance.
A wedding dress is not light, in every sense, a dress is a complex construction, it has a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable to move.
Some women also think that a taller girl in a white dress will look even taller and thus less confident.
I can assure you that a well-chosen dress will solve this "problem" in a certain way", explained Robert Kalinkin, a fashion designer who is a member of the panel.
The girls' fate is decided by R. Kalinkin and the entire commission - the fashion house's grandfather Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social media star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukšte.
"There's a lot of friction between the members of the committee about who should say goodbye to the show, because we all represent different areas and have different ideas about the winner.
The challenge of demonstrating wedding dresses was further complicated, and this is what I can reveal now, two new ones that were certainly no worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening in every way", says R. Kalinkin.
The newcomer, Eve, who became famous for her scandalous 23 years on a summer reality show, and the 31-year-old mother of two, Dovilla, who is exceptionally beautiful, were among the first 20 girls selected for the "Great (r) Evolution" competition.
Unfortunately, after the first open photo shoot of girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girl brought back the LNK viewers who voted for her favorite on the TV portal.
The internationally acclaimed reality show is now in its second week in Lithuania, where girls of different sizes are competing for the title of the first country's biggest star.
So far, there are only eight of them left, and they all know perfectly well that only one winner can win.
The intriguing and unpredictable reality show "Evolve of the Big (r) " week begins this Monday evening at 8:30 pm on the LNC.
Actor I. Elba is the sexiest man in the world
People magazine in the US named him the sexiest man in the world this year.
He became the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that the news was unexpected when he told him about the new title, he did not make a fool of himself.
I thought, "It can't be!
Seriously?"
And then I looked at myself in the mirror and I thought -- yes, I look sexy today -- laughing at the actor sharing.
Idris, speaking frankly, said that the title was a very pleasant feeling that had taken away his ego.
The British star said that he was often subjected to slurs and abuse, which made his childhood difficult, as he says, because he was "very tall and shallow".
The young actor was not popular with his peers and was also a target of interest because of his unusual and unusual name and African origin.
"I grew up to be the toughest boy in my city", says Idris, smiling.
When a man loses his pride in being on screen, Elba works as a disc jockey at parties in Spain, particularly in the bustling city of Ibiza.
A man in his spare time enjoys Thai boxing and has a comforting fashion line that he creates by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor says his family is the most important thing in the world, so he's planning a wedding with his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33rd sexiest man in the world as chosen by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was won by Blake Shelton.
Man beaten to death at a drinking party in the grazing district
Monday night, a man was stabbed to death during a drinking session in the village of Salkiški in the district of Širvints.
According to Vilnius County Police, a man beat a neighbor at a drinking party at 9:16 p.m.
When the doctors arrived, they found a man who had been born in 1943 dead.
Arrested as a 1994 suspect with a 2.53 proof of sobriety.
The police are explaining the circumstances of the incident.
Controllers do not require a distance of 20 km when building waste incineration plants
The construction of the cogeneration plant in Vilnius, near the Gariuli market.
The management will not be able to maintain a distance of 20 kilometers from the settlements when building waste incinerators.
The head of the Environment Committee, Kęstutis Mažeika, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Sejm on Monday, denying the requirement.
According to Mažeik, the 'Waltsiers' faction, which had previously supported the 20 km provision, pledges to support the amendment to its withdrawal.
The amendment provides that from January 2019 onwards, waste incineration plants could be built to the environmental and public health requirements laid down in the legislation.
He acknowledges that the amendment raised the President's doubts about such a ban.
'Given the definition of a residential area, it is clear that it would be almost impossible to find a site where the above mentioned facilities could be built,' says the Chairman of the Committee.
The ruling majority opposed the presidential veto in October to amendments to tighten the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the prohibition of the construction of waste incineration plants within 20 km of residential areas, the amendments allowed the Government to decide on the future of two existing power plants, taking into account the public health interests.
The latter provisions are not proposed to be corrected by Mr Mažeika.
The waste and biofuel power plant is being built in Vilnius by the energy group Lithuania Energy and in Kaunas by the company Fortum Heat Lietuva, a Finnish energy group.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
There is talk of a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The leaders of the UK and Ireland discussed a possible compromise on Monday to resolve the complex Northern Ireland issue that has stalled Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
Speaking by telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed the possibility of reviewing the so-called 'insurance measures agreement' mechanism to allow the open border between the United Kingdom's Northern Ireland province and the European Union's Republic of Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider the proposal but has rejected any possibility of the UK unilaterally withdrawing from the agreement, according to a statement issued by the Irish government.
In the interview, Mr May 'expressed the possibility of revising the mechanism of insurance measures', it states.
'The Government has made it clear that it is open to review new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to suspend the application of the measures in place,' the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators have not reached a decision on how to avoid checks at the UK/Ireland land border when Britain withdraws from the single market and customs union in March next year.
The parties agree on 'guaranteed measures' to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a wider trade agreement is signed, to ensure that no further customs checks at the border are carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be temporarily applied to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking a unilateral withdrawal from the insurance measures agreement within three months.
But Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "could not support it".
'Three months or a limited term guarantee is not worth the paper it will be written on,' he said.
London and Brussels have not previously confirmed information about the breakthrough in Brexit negotiations following a report in the UK over the weekend that an agreement was being reached.
"I would say we are making progress in negotiations, but there is still work to be done", said Mrs May's spokesman in London.
Margaritis Schin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, also told reporters: "We are not there yet".
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of surviving thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a statement on Monday calling for the right to reliable information to be guaranteed in the Internet age.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, and Mario Vargas Llosa, writer and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.
"We call on leaders of good will on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates where citizens can make decisions based on facts", the group said in a statement.
They argue that the 'global information and communication space' is a common good that 'must be protected to enhance freedom of expression and opinion'.
'People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on the truth of the obligation, the principles of pluralism of attitudes and rational fact-finding methods,' the authors of the declaration added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who is often criticized for "false news" but regularly accused of falsifying facts.
World leaders should express their views on this issue at the Paris Peace Forum on 11-13 November, the signatories called on.
The declaration was prepared within two months, under the direction of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christophe Deloire), head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based organisation for media freedom and journalists' rights.
The signatories include former President of Senegal Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act which provide for increased fines for product safety violations.
The amendments to the Rules of Procedure were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As stated by Antan Vinkus, Member of the Sejm's Health Committee, in his remarks on the new project, he welcomes the fact that the objectives set out are related to better consumer protection of products.
It also aligns its provisions with the requirements of the European Parliament and Council Decision.
'My head, in the proposed bill, is more fully and specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current penal system does not always prevent further infringements, as the parties who have paid fines continue to commit repeat infringements,' said Mr Vinkus.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and supplemented by its proposals by the Sejm Economic Committee, with the approval of the Government.
The amendments aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, give more power to market surveillance authorities and create a clear system for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance with them.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, producers are not currently required to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, the Ministry claims that market surveillance authorities are not granted access to the premises, buildings, premises and inspections of producers and suppliers during the State product safety control, which complicates the work of the authorities.
The Ministry considers that the six-month period for fines and warnings is too short to identify the infringement, investigate it and impose a fine.
The Ministry also said that the fines imposed were not sufficiently effective.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should be able to take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established a legal basis for the assessment of the compatibility of the aid.
The Ministry of Economy proposed that producers be required to properly label and track a product in order to facilitate the disclosure of non-compliant suppliers to market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to access, in the context of State product safety controls, the territory, buildings and premises of operators producing and supplying products to the market for inspection.
The fines for violations of the law are to be increased.
A fine of EUR 150 to 2 500 (currently 144 to 1 448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who places dangerous products on the market and on the distributor who places dangerous services on the market or supplies them.
If the State Consumer Protection Authority (SPCA) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of EUR 1 000 to 5 000 (currently between 868 and 4 344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of EUR 2500 to 6 500 (currently 1 448 to 5 792).
If the dangerous products were harmful to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (currently between EUR 1 448 and EUR 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products resulted in the death of the consumer, a fine of EUR 6 500 to 25 000 (currently between 5 792 and 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (minimum fine not fixed) is imposed in Poland and Austria for infringements of product safety legislation, a fine of between EUR 26 and EUR 600 000 in Belgium, a fine of between EUR 155 and EUR 6 666 in Romania, and a fine of between EUR 125 and EUR 7 500 in Bulgaria.
10-year-old had a baby: raped by a family member
The incident in Colombia has affected millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl who was raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world through a cesarean section, but both the girl and her baby are fine.
They were being looked after by a doctor for a while.
It's just a matter of time before the young mother and baby are released home.
"From the information I received from police officers, the minor became pregnant after being sexually exploited by a family member - a brother", the hospital's director told a foreign television station.
Police are investigating a rape and child abuse incident.
The Norwegian Armed Battalion participated in the most remote and harshest NATO exercises
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
This is part of NATO's Triangle Junction 2018 exercise, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the Norwegian Armed Forces after the September 11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home in places like Afghanistan, that is, in warmer regions.
But they are most skilled in the Arctic, and their skills are especially useful now that NATO is shifting its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tyneside, often in the most remote and harshest of places, soldiers have been engaged in staged battles against real British troops.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in harsh climates they have to carry a much larger weight on their shoulders - a single suitcase weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers at the headquarters say they share their skills in surviving and fighting in these conditions with other NATO soldiers.
According to the military, these exercises, which are like no other exercises that are reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be prepared in the event of a serious threat.

Withdrawn Kaunas vice-president does not plan to return to politics
Former Kaunas deputy mayor, Pavel Mačiul, who left his job at the municipality and the organization "Unity Kaunas" for supporting Vygaud Ušak in the presidential election, has no plans to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I'm going to focus on business.
I'm a shareholder in several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
Most importantly, I will enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with my family", Maciel told BNS.
He also said he had no plans to contest the upcoming municipal elections.
Mr Maciel has not yet had a chance to speak with Mr Ushak after the first election of the Union of Christian Democrats of the Fatherland-Lithuania was won by Ingrid Simoneta on Sunday.
"To be honest, we haven't had a thorough discussion with him and the team yet about the results and the future plans.
It is clear that with Viggaud's retirement from further campaigning, this phase of my life is over", said Maciel.
He said he was not sorry about leaving Kaunas' policy of supporting V. Ušak, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost the unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations".
Mr Maciel served briefly as Deputy Mayor of Kaunas in 2011 and then returned to the post after the successful Uniting Kaunas elections in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school Erudito Licay and several other companies.
The workers in the castle of Kaunas are floating: what are they doing here?
The men of war saw the workers blowing at the castle of Kaunas, and they were shocked that the remaining tower was being rebuilt.
Gabrieli Suzidelis, director of the Museum of the City of Kaunas, confirmed that the southwest tower with a fragment of the defensive wall was undergoing a change of roof protection.
According to the interviewer, the roofs will be shallow.
"The emergency-made roof posed a threat to the environment - people could fall and get injured - and had to be replaced.
The roofs were no longer moisturized, and so the heritage was damaged", explains the museum's director.
Will these roofs be the same as those of a few centuries ago?
"All work is coordinated with heritage and other institutions", Mr Offense added, "in order to make the result as authentic as possible, the practical side is important: the roof must protect the values from moisture.
The universal solution chosen in the context of heritage.
Before that, the building's elements were covered in Soviet times, so they no longer have historical value", the museum director of the city of Kaunas said.
The contract of employment was signed on 2 October.
The work is planned to last no longer than three months from the date of signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be finished by the end of November", the museum director said.
According to him, the value of the work carried out is almost EUR 24 000.
This amount, according to the interlocutor, was provided for in this year's budget.
The work at Kaunas Castle is carried out by Statia.
Kaunas. dag.lt has written that according to the research, Kaunas Castle could have looked earlier.
The United States and South Korea resume naval exercises
A naval exercise with about 500 troops will now be held in the southern city of Pohang for two weeks, Seoul's Defense Ministry said.
The United States has 28,500 troops in South Korea.
For years, the two countries have been preparing joint military maneuvers, which Pyongyang calls "provocation" and "preparation for invasion".
On Friday, North Korea announced it would resume its nuclear program unless Washington lifted economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change in course could be "seriously considered", the North Korean Foreign Ministry said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told television that the penalties would remain in place until Pyongyang renounces its nuclear weapons.
He also announced that he will meet North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.
Maxima expands in Bulgaria - Business knowledge
The largest retail company in the Baltic States, the Maxima Group, is expanding in Bulgaria, where it operates a chain of T-Market brand stores.
Maxima Bulgaria CEO Edwin Volkas told the business publication Capital that the company will open two more stores by the end of this year, bringing the total to 74 stores in the country.
According to Volko, seven to 10 more stores are planned to open in Bulgaria next year.
The company recently opened a new concept T-Market Express store in Sofia, where it invested EUR 1 million.
It has a "social zone" that operates all day long, with free Internet access, smartphone access, and the purchase of sandwiches, salads, and other dishes.
According to Mr Volk, 2018 will be the first year in which the company will end up with a positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) indicator.
Mr Volkas forecasts that Maxima Bulgaria's revenue will grow by 40% this year to EUR 158,5 million.
The company had revenues of EUR 113,3 million last year.
The Maxima Group has been operating in Bulgaria since 2005.
Last year, the company was ranked among the top 10 largest retail networks in the country for the first time.
The Maxima Group, which is owned by the Vilnius Trading Group, controlled by Neria Numavičius, intends to invest around EUR 200 million this year and next year, mainly in Poland, where Maxima acquired the trading network Stokrotka.
The group operates a retail network in the Baltic States, including Maxima, and an e-food shop in Barbora, and in Poland, Stokrotka and Aldik.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific methodology for the assessment of the impact of the measures on the environment.
The Center for Eastern European Studies will work with two leading US "brain centers"
According to Lin Kojala, the Resc's head in Vilnius, now in his 13th year, the US involvement will allow the implementation of the projects and make Lithuania's voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We've been working toward this for a few months.
I am pleased that the two major institutions see us as partners and look for opportunities for common action.
I have no doubt that the activities in the niches will emerge, as the topics of NATO, security, disinformation, development of the Eastern Partnership countries that we are analysing are also priorities for them", Kojala said.
The agreements note that the RESC and the US authorities will work together to develop international project applications, exchange expertise and knowledge, and conduct expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FPRI has been in operation since 1955 and brings together nearly 100 top-level analysts.
In the latest global analytics centre ranking by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
Meanwhile, CEPA, whose analysts have been invited to consult and work with top US political institutions on numerous occasions, is ranked 10th in its category.
"This will give Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions more opportunities to make their mark in the US information space and will encourage us to raise the quality bar", Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners to distribute the forthcoming RESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review to US decision-makers and the public.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of projects underway and does not maintain target grants.
The partners of the RESC, with whom joint initiatives are implemented, include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
Two people were seriously injured in a collapse of two buildings in Marseille, southern France, on Monday, the fire department said.
As the buildings reached the street, debris broke down, dust clouds rose.
Dozens of firefighters were working at the site near the famous old port of Marseille, some with trained dogs.
The local prefecture posted photos on Twitter showing a pile of debris and wood, a huge gap in the building site, firefighters working at the scene and cars covered in a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they're looking for people who may have been trapped under the wreckage.
The Marseille fire department tweeted that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
A favorite video shown on BFM-TV shows dust clouds in the streets and handcuffs covering the passers-by.
Google Street View photos taken before the incident showed one of the buildings collapsing had five floors and the other had six floors.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, with closed windows, with large façade cracks.
The mayor of Marseille, Sabine Bernasconi, said one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.
But the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building might have been used by the people who lived there.
The prefecture urged people to avoid the area and clear roads for rescue services.
The mayor of Marseille, Sabine Bernascon, said the building was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.

Mexican restaurant helping U.S.-deported migrants
The further away, the more Mexicans are deported back, and the more difficult it is for them to adapt.
"When I was deported, they took everything from me: my house, my car, my clothes.
They took everything but one thing - my knowledge", says Victor Hugo Hernandez, the restaurant's director.
The restaurant's board hopes that the combination of Mexican and American cultures will foster better understanding.
