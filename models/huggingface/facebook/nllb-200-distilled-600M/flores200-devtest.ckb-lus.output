lusts [American wild cat] prefers to feed on small animals. Monkeys, snakes, predators and birds hunt. Most of the animals it preys on are much smaller than it is.
lusus is believed to be the location of animals in the sense of smell and to be found for food (nectar), smelling the place where they were on the ground.
lusus can see better at night, and can move very far. Oscillates distort their prey by mixing them with their surroundings and then attacking them.
lusus. When a small group of organisms (a small group) is separated from the main group from which they originate (such as if they climbed a mountain or crossed a river, or if they moved to a new island where they are unable to return easily) they often find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
lusus. This new environment has different resources and competitive characteristics, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor to the previous one.
lusus. The indigenous population has not changed, and still needs the same adjustment.
lusua. As new populations begin to adapt to the new environment, they become less and less likely to adapt to the new environment.
