How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there many sharks around here?
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
He's from Sweden.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with fleas.
I feel safe.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this funny, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20.
It's a beautiful picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Does Tom work here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being so sarcastic!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had a good time.
She's not being honest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got irritated.
I'm old now.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought an English book in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Get out of here, everybody.
Giant pandas only live in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say that stuff.
It's getting worse.

You did good here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm just relaxed.

We leave Boston in the morning.
We can't leave you there.

Stop whining.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We are waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't seem too surprising.
I don't go to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom is a cheat, isn't he?
Is this cage meant to protect you from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?
I used to play the trombone when I was younger.
I'm loyal to you.
Can you write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why are you trying to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to get more active.
Are Tom and Mary joking?
She broke out of smoke.
I have no other choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What are you doing this summer?
He got irritated.
Do you speak Shanghaiese?
It shrank because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was it paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
I'm in London?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This is going to make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead by sunset.
Who's your favorite female rapper?
I greet Tom from me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving so soon?
I'm pretty proud of that.
I can smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
I happened to sit next to her at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for class.
She's a little overweight, isn't she?
Who's the man playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
I slept in the car.
Tom and I will go to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his income drinking.
Search harder on Google!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does that sound familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Are they going to die?
I really like it.
Are you coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When is your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good at it.
How would you change it?
It's snowing today.
He promised to write me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our child alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether or not he drinks wine.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. Who will give more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay in a hotel.
I didn't grow up like this.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I miss it almost every day.
I'm not going to apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's the deciding factor.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his purse for the car keys.
I don't really want to talk.
So it must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I suggest you be more careful.
It's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American food.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
It'll be clear in the afternoon.
He went blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that painting?
How many continents are there?
He's a good singer, isn't he?
Tom is angry with Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers, the first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom is getting emotional.
I was just scared.
It's a party tomorrow.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I'd like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy with this.
I appreciate your intuition.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We have to inform Tom.
Tom is still sleeping.
Tom is a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use the most?
You lighted the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German cars are among the best.
Call them.
That's cool.
Tom doesn't respect Mary's opinions.
She's going to the camp.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When is school over?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd get it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a pattern.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most common fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have something to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue down.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose whatever you want.
I'm in the hospital, I was struck by lightning.
Did you call them?
Turn off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a professor?
It was a really scary story.
He's in the van.
I'm not introducing them.
Do you like golf?
I'm sorry I interrupted you the other day.
Can you believe this?
I waited for a bus to arrive.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.
I wasn't good.
You students are required to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
This is a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
A lot of people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I don't know how to drive very well.
I heard Tom is learning to drive.
You know I love you deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is that we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I knocked down the branch with an axe.
The minigames are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least at six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner, I'll take a walk on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
He's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for over ten years.
We're grateful for the music he left us.
It's not that the idea of putting an ammonia appliance in my house is so appealing to me.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run after the cat.
I'm a cop. I'm not a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I just buy you a hat?
I thought Tom would get out alive.
She's pale to the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom is my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountains?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on board.
You are charming.
People drink tea in your country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We lost sight of him.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Go and wake them up.
Which tooth hurts?
You have to read between the lines.
Tom was proud.
Tom was a little baffled by Mary's request.
I'm here to help him.
It's not easy to speak English well.
I don't believe a word you say.
Get the fuck out of here!
Naoko only drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You are vulgar.
Tom is getting better.
We can help you.
They called us.
I think Tom must be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why does this always happen to me?
The birds are catching the ground.
The park is closed on Monday.
You didn't even update the firmware?
I got a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do that now?
All my friends like them.
I like my language.
Why won't you answer me?
We are Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.
You guys coming in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
His horse had a heart attack.
It's worth a visit to the ruins.
He should be prepared for the worst.
Tom pulled the suitcases out of the trunk.
This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry. I know.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember his license plate number?
He lied to us.
She has seven children.
Let's hear the music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
You bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take him to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
That's what happened to me.
He has many friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.
Are you reading this book tonight?
Does Tom have a car?
I'll be all right, don't worry about it.
Tom rarely laughs.
I can't forget her smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know of any Canadians living in Australia?
Tom is bored, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do you like it?
What exactly do you want Tom to do?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
She turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She was supposed to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door closing.
She got him drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You're stubborn.
I'm not nervous.
You have a nice dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you planning to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with his leap reached the stillness of Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My father always gets involved in my private life.
Everybody wants something different.
Tom refused to execute the order.
I know you don't like them.
I didn't know about your plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
How about we go for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Do Tom and Mary sing?
Are Tom and Mary okay?
Contracting is common in the markets.
They shot him.
We're sorry to bother you.
Tom was looking for his pen.
I don't want him to see this.
How many kidneys does a human have?
A saving money is a earning money.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
She's been through red.
Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started acting weird.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
You want me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You're a coincidence.
Please, turn down the music.
I'll train Tom for the job.
She watched him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.
The Queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children played together.
Say it again, please.
You're upsetting her.
Sami is not here to ruin your day.
I took off my shoes.
I am learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?
The woman is drinking water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is cheap, it will soon close its doors if the food doesn't taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What are we supposed to do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You look relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it in a second-hand store.
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't mean anything.
You're lying to me.
She helped him.
Everybody was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates clubs.
Go home now.
Tom told me that Mary was busy.
Where's my money?
No one saw her do it.
Tom hasn't read any of these books.
You're still inexperienced.
I have to go to work now.
You came too early.
He can speak ten languages.
Come home before it gets dark.
I got off the train at the wrong station.
I hated French in high school.
Aren't you supposed to be home with your mother?
He has blue eyes and blond hair.
I can't understand that.
Tell him who you are.
My name sounds weird.
I'll never forget that night.
Just add an exclamation point to all your sentences.
Can you see anything in there?
You're ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They are traitors.
I'm going to stay.
I'm not always busy.
I'll be there for you.
I got up before dawn.
I'll be right behind you.
How long have you lived in Kobe?
We're getting closer.
Tom always says the same thing.
Have you spoken to Tom?
Try to get some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
He asked how to cook the fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom is a golden boy.
You seem to be wary of ideas coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She makes me puke.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock broke.
I'm not going to wait forever.
Just give the order.
Do you know any Canadians living in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom isn't angry.
The rock was moved with dynamite.
Mary prepared breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can keep them.
This smell is unbearable.
She became famous.
What are you saying?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
She's got the balloon.
We have to go.
Staying home is not fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like his son to study more.
I opened an account at a bank nearby.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
It was nice to see you.
You don't have to worry about that.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much paper do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom is talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You are a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a second.
Let's have dinner together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture in.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June's not that far away either.
Why does Tom hate him so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes are wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you gonna leave me?
Tom always liked you.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me some questions?
Don't make fun of Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took risks.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
You know Tom, don't you?
It wasn't my idea to hire you.
Last night my grandmother missed without suffering.
I know why you're angry with them.
You know Tom likes cars.
You passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can read Spanish easily.
Do I need to use ink?
Don't fall off the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas presents.
Can't Tom swim?
Kids usually get up early at Christmas.
I'll be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he look so rude?
There's nothing I can do for her.
The father is good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a board game.
Everybody believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something before.
The work leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have a cough every 30 minutes.
Tom is much older now.
Tom is better.
I think Tom is pessimistic.
You have to help them.
I sometimes write to my mother.
You don't trust anyone.
I regret that I was never nice to him.
Have Tom call me.
It hasn't changed a thing.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too early.
I should have eaten more.
Of the 20 female students, only one has read the book.
To love someone means to see them as God intended them to be.
Don't lie to them.
They live with her?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure George will like this idea.
They're afraid to say it publicly.
Please identify yourself.
You leave us.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost it.
I almost dropped the plates.
There's a phone in my room.
Is that serious?
Tom composed the 911.
We're brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week was great.
You want a tray with that?
She doesn't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we fix it?
This is the magazine from last month.
They're not back yet.
She's about your age, isn't she?
He's in the back.
We can't let them die.
It's a nerve.
Tom arrived late.
Tom stayed behind.
This will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your vacation?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved into the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary corrected it.
Have you ever spoken to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When did you come back from London?
Tom is always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you guys dance.
Tom bowed down for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It sounds so fake.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.

Bob has many books in his room.
They followed Tom.
The ship disappeared on the horizon.

Something was going on.
Send it by mail.
It's interesting, right?
Mary accidentally bumped into Tom.
I'm no one's enemy.
I forgot your number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's an error in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to get away?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired. Take him home, please.
May all your wishes come true!
She's already done it.
He's an expert on word processors.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
