Professor called 911 and confessed to killing his girlfriend.
University professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told police that she shot her girlfriend with a gun and that the police were supposed to be coming home.
Lamb said her "lovely dog" was alive and probably sad, and that the family of the deceased woman's phones could be found on her cell phone.
Police found Amy Prentiss' lifeless body in the house and a white notebook with a handwritten note that read, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could return everything, I loved Amy so much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me", officials said.
There was no indication that Lamb, who gave two online lectures for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, was already 300 miles from the campus where he thought police-loved history professor Ethan Scmidt had been shot and killed outside his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials fired at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb also said he made the vicious 911 call shortly after.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as police approached him.
The day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what prompted Lamb to do so.
On both sides of the state, the details were drawn by investigators, students and staff who knew him, and he painted a picture of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to taking her class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal record.
In fact, Schmidt referred to Lamb in his book as one of the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both had taught in the Social Sciences and History Department, which had 17 faculty members listed, and many students had taken lessons from both.
However, there were also signs of mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke highly of Lamb, said that he was also a worried and nervous person and "looked like he had a problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave, stating that he had some health problems.
He only gave two online lessons this year.
Recent changes to the university's recruitment policies, despite the doctorate Lamb worked hard to earn, could not guarantee that he would automatically become a full-time faculty member.
University dean William LaForge said he was unaware of a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it is obvious that something was going on in Lamb's mind".
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was evacuated, police tracked Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Director of Judicial Investigation Methel Johnson revealed that Lamb committed suicide with a single .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile from his family's home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, before his arrest.
Lamb's car was found working on the highway.
Although it was not immediately clear why Lamb had gone to this house, Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at a university of 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 in 2009, where he taught geography and education.
He had his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me when they met through her friends that she was 15, Lamb was 20.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a very nice guy, trying to teach him how to play guitar for a few years.
He was a fast-beating heartbeat back then.
Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon, said of Lamb, "All the girls would melt when he came".
Lamb and Prentiss have been together for a while.
Lamb said on the 911 call, "I killed my wife", but there's no official record of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in their brick houses on the river in Gautier.
Police said the dog is in good condition.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but Prentiss and he were always friends, and they have a daughter who's now 19.
O'Steen also said her daughter was in a completely ruined state.
She and her mother were two great friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail performed at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together at public performances.
O'Steen stated that his daughter wrote and sang the music herself.
Prentiss was a nurse for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, who serves as bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a loose bar near Gautier, said Lamb and Prentiss were last seen on the night of September 5th after Lamb finished playing guitar and music to a small audience.
There was no sign of a problem.
She said they were a pretty happy couple.
Sometimes we cut and threw a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, noted that the murdered Professor Schmidt directed a seminar program for first-graders and was an expert on Native American and colonial history.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas, where he was also president of a student-led solidarity group he founded.
On Tuesday night, approximately 900 people, including academics, university staff, students and visitors from the local community, attended the candlestick ceremony on the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt attended the memorial service, where the college choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Great Joke".
Classes continue on Wednesday.
LaForge said, "We're trying to get our students back".
The crisis is over.
Time to wrap up.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (New Orleans) contributed to the story.
This news text was corrected to reflect the fact that the police said Lamb called 911 after killing Schmidt and that there was no official evidence that the two were married, despite Lamb referring to Prentiss as "his wife" on the 911 call.
Toys R Us plans to buy less holiday element
Toys R Us announced that it will not hire more holiday season staff this year than last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer said it would give more work opportunities to its existing employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be part-time.
The company said interviews with candidates would begin this month and the number of staff would increase from October to December.
With months to go, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to equip their stores to hire temporary employees to help them sell, ship and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox has been making jokes about his relationship with Princess Diana
The opening credits of "Back to the Future" are a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was very important for personal reasons.
In a fragment of his forthcoming documentary Back in Time, he relates: "We were sitting in a cinema waiting for members of the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I knew that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me.
The movie started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and a bracelet away from me.
A documentary about the film Back in Time, Back in Time features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future first came into view 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel movie I've ever made".
Back in Time will be released on VOD and DVD, as well as in select theaters.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Commenting on Russia's growing military support to Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the nearly five-year-old Syrian problem "could not be solved by military intervention" and that more weapons would only be more violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together and hold constructive talks to find a political solution to the problem.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with five permanent council members of the U.S., China, Russia, Britain and France's foreign ministers on Syria at the UN General Assembly meeting, which will be held towards the end of the month.
He expressed deep regret that the division between the members of the council and the Syrian people has made the issue "irresolvable" by regional powers.
Ban invited the five permanent members to unite in the Syrian crisis, as in the Iran nuclear deal.
Eight polls show that Donald Trump is serious
Some tried to label him a firefighter.
The others pushed him like a joke.
And some are supporting the internal explosion.
Some Republicans tried to drag Donald Trump down in the polls, but it didn't work.
The latest 11 national polls have shown him to be Donald Trump's double-digit leader, and some are seriously questioning the real estate emperor's chances of running.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this means Trump can win the Republican nomination.
Experts say that Rick Perry's rise during this period in 2011 led to a rise for Herman Cain, both of whom failed to win a nomination in a single state.
And there are many reasons why he's going to have trouble in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Growth Club realize Trump's enduring power and start spending their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent survey results showing that the real estate emperor is not just a transient:
Trump's preference rating has changed 180 degrees.
A poll conducted at Monmouth University shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate emperor.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
It was 52 percent in early August.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 indicate a negative opinion.
And these numbers are at an early stage.
Last week, a poll in Quinnipiac, Iowa, showed that 60 percent of Republicans there prefer Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters might be happy with Trump's candidacy.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "excited" or "concerned" if Trump ran.
Only two out of 10 said they'd "beaten" if he was a candidate.
It's just that Ben Carson is as enthusiastic as Trump (for Trump, that's 40 percent, while 43 percent said they'd be "enthusiastic").
The other person closest to the excitement?
It's only 21 percent Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "disappointed" if Jeb Bush, the organization's favorite candidate, were to run.
The majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperance as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been criticized for his arrogant language and insults, according to a poll by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday, 52 percent of Republicans surveyed believe the real estate emperor has the right humor for president.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where Quinnipac last week said 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to lead.
Still, 44 percent feel they don't have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say their temperament doesn't fit the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to it.
When they wear their political expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Last week, a CNN/ORC poll found that when asked who was the best candidate for the GOP nomination, four out of 10 people said Trump was the best.
That's a change from the end of July when four out of 10 people invested their money in Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal ballot of GOP voters was not very clear.
In the last election cycle at that time, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be the nominee, but only 28 percent chose Mitt Romney, who eventually became the nominee.
It still seems that the majority of GOP voters are still mindful of Trump's election campaign.
Even if the Republicans are rallying around another candidate, Trump still wins almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the scattered area may also contribute to Trump's rise to prominence, and it's a fact that anti-Trump support is scattered among more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September showed that in the event of a head-on collision between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump always gained the majority's support.
Carly outscored Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's on the same level as Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In case of a possible confrontation, Ben Carson outscores businessman by 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump supporters say they've made their decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who supported Trump said they were blocking their vote.
And frankly, there's a lot that can happen to change that, and no one can really say they won't change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to change candidates.
Trump's biggest opponent is still brain surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made their decision are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rape" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of his 2016 conversation.
Some believe Trump's over-talking has alienated important Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and will hurt his rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration is on the agenda, Trump seems to be on the agenda.
Anger at the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are roughly half the Republican vote because of their largely outsiders.
In a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they want someone from the outside world instead of someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll conducted in Iowa two weeks ago found that three out of every four Republicans in Iowa were angry with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "unconvinced" and 21 percent were "extremely angry".
In the Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn will take the floor for the first time.
Mr Corbyn's inauguration as Prime Minister has been eagerly awaited.
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will take the floor for the first time since David Cameron in the Prime Minister's Questions.
Mr Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after noon, and his performance looks to be closely monitored by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theater and more reality" in the weekly show.
He also said he could skip some sessions, leave them to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, following his appointment as Shadow Cabinet minister and his speech at TUC's annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's silence during the national anthem recitation at a commemoration ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday was also criticized by some Tory MPs and has been in the forefront of newspaper news.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem has drawn attention.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he stood in "a respectable silence" and appreciated "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But Owen Smith, one of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet members, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
About a dozen shadowy members of Mr Corbyn's senior team refused to serve because of differences in economics, defence and foreign relations, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant notes that political differences within the Labour Party are also beginning to "grow", and these are issues of Mr Corbyn's appointment to a position in the European Union and the government's application of upper limits on aid.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had proposed new changes to completely remove the upper limit.
Hours later, the shadow minister for labour and pensions, Mr Smith, said that the party was only opposed to the government's lowering the upper limit of £26,000 to £23,000 and was "very open" about it.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to meet in the House of Commons since David Cameron became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader promised a different approach to politics, saying he had received "public-sourced" and more than 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr Cameron.
The MP for Islington North said the Prime Minister's Questions programme was very arm-wearing and would focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people rather than "growing answers" with a needle-shaped exchange of words.
Mr Corbyn said that when he was not, for example, Mr Cameron was traveling abroad, he would be represented by Shadow Trade Minister Angela Eagle on the Prime Minister's Questions programme.
In fact, time has suggested that other colleagues take the stage and that they have approached Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow to address the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron expressed his desire to move away from the "Ears-Game" style of politics often associated with the Prime Minister's Questions program, but admitted a few years later that he had failed in this regard.
Since its first publication in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions programme has been used as a basic benchmark to measure the decision-making abilities of leaders, their positions among the House of Commons authorities and the MPs; in return, some critics have stated that it has been caricatured and that it requires far-reaching reforms.
'Filmed in Joburg': homeless youths studying photography
Johannesburg city centre is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of old street kids found a way to earn a new talent and make a living.
I was shot in Joburg, a non-profit studio that photographs homeless youth in their neighborhoods and teaches them how to make a living from it.
She went to meet one of the first graduates of the BBC News project.

The pound rises as wage increases in the UK accelerate
The FTSE 100 index also rose following a bid for SABMillers, while the UK saw a rapid rise in the pound following data showing higher wages.
Payroll in the UK, excluding premiums, increased by 2.9% between May and July compared to the same period the previous year.
This rate, the fastest since 2009, is also seen as a leading indicator of possible interest rate increases.
The value of the pound rose to $1,5505 against the US dollar, gaining more than 1%, and to €1,3730 against the euro, gaining 0.84.
The FTSE 100 Index rose by 1.49% to 6.229.21 points.
The most prominent company in this rise was SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase in attractive buy-in bids from its competitor AB InBev.
This proposal will bring together the world's two largest beer companies and bring together well-known brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch under one roof.
Burberry shares rose 0.9 percent, driven by positive earnings from rival luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont's current sales figures have also shown that sales are beginning to rise again in China, one of the key markets for Burberry, as well as exceeding expectations.
Mining giant Glencore's shares rose 5% after it announced it had secured $2.5 billion in earnings from the company's debt reduction strategy.
The shares of packaging and paper group Mondi were among the most depreciated after Goldman Sachs lowered its offer for the company to "Sat", with a loss of 4.3 percent.
JD Sports' stake rose 3.1 percent after it announced that the company's six-month pre-tax profit had increased by 83 percent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries could hurt the expansion
Peter Cowgill, chairman of JD Sports' board, said that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But he said that his spending power would not exceed the high labor costs of his own company.
He added that the costs would affect JD Sports' expansion plans, which could mean less extra work.
Metcash has launched a popular campaign to fight the Aldi invasion.
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market maker Metcash has launched a public campaign to defend its retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the $700 million Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open the first of its two distribution centres and stores, which will reach 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and are trying to build the IGA brand with mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide Fair.
IGA bakers and suppliers also contribute to the IGA's stores with brands such as Simmo, a Dunsborough-based ice cream maker that offers flavor tests, and shopkeepers who sell discounted South Australian Football League tickets to their loyal customers.
Food, beverage and hardware wholesaler Metcash is expected to provide more details on its defense strategy as it prepares its annual investor strategy day on September 29.
The risk is high because South Australia and Western Australia represent nearly 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
South Australian and Western Australian shopkeepers are negatively narrow-minded and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they did in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% more in GA than in the Eastern states and 24% more in the UAE.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that within 12 months of Aldi opening its first stores in these two states, it will take about 5 percent of the market, taking sales from existing players but generally unconnected retailers.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose $360 million in one year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This is based on Aldi's prediction that it will open 25 stores in GA and 30 in the UAE next year, and will generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
Mr. Kierath said the loss of food and grocery sales and Metcash's high fixed-cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13 million in interest and pre-tax earnings.
Metcash is also losing market share in eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite recent Roy Morgan research showing that IGA customers are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and market sales will decline by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, bringing its market share down from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder and chief fund manager Hamish Douglass said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "could probably be wiped out in 10 years".
Metcash declined to comment on Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it appears a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's earnings from its food and grocery business, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43% since 2012, an indication that the business leverage rate has declined as sales and margins have come under pressure.
But the wholesaler is resisting, investing more than $150 million a year in the Coles and Woolworths for the equivalent shelf prices of hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish their stores, adding faster-growing fresh food and opening up a better private label chain of stores to the public.
Metcash executive chairman Ian Morrice says price matching and store renewal programs are starting to pay off, and that wholesalers are expected to return to core profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis, supported by Steve Healy, president of Tennis Australia
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
According to Steve Healy, president of Tennis Australia, Thanasi Kokkinakis was the casualty of the latest storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo normally referred to as the "Special K's", found himself in the spotlight unwelcome by Kyrgios' face-cold crushing of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In the afternoon's tough hand-to-hand match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and rival Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the referee, and Harrison made the following statement: "Wawrinka came on Kyrgios, and I must go on that kid".
Kokkinakis, who was seen breaking his rocket at the most recent US Open to potentially displease Richard Gasquet, was loyally defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing in Glasgow with Sam Groth for the second singles title behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the Davis Cup semi-final.
Healy said, "What I'm feeling a little enthusiastic about is thinking Thanasi is getting into a debate".
He broke his rocket when he lost in the USA, but he's not the first player to break his rocket because he was disappointed in himself, and I know Thanasi knows enough not to be proud of it.
But the truth is that in the United States, Harrison and others have been very good at handling themselves under extremely provocative circumstances, and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He's got a great team, a great family, and I think he's a little overreacted.
Even though he's 19, he's extremely mature, he's very hardworking and he's adaptable, he's okay with other players, he's well-respected in the dressing room, he's doing tough training, he's a very balanced and mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged in his own way.
Healy also supported the decision to welcome Kyrgios for the important match; from Friday, he began to explain that what was right for everyone from now on was to "mutually decide" but support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term ironhead.
Healy said: "First of all we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not the disputes around [Kyrgios]".
And I think, as people like Nick, Federer, and Murray have pointed out, the kid has grown up very quickly, growing up in public, and he's made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not in the spotlight, he deeply believes that my thinking is appropriate, that it's best for him and the team.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detain migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to stop the flow of migrants, shutting down its southern border with Serbia and detained those trying to enter the country illegally.
Hundreds of migrants have gathered in the neutral zone, creating chaos at the border, and Serbian authorities have moved in anger.
Migrants fleeing violence in their home countries set up tents along the roadside between the two countries' checkpoints for an indefinite period of time.
But his anger was growing.
As a police helicopter passed over, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian police of the Fusilian police force.
Others refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said Hungary's return of migrants from Macedonia and Greece was "unacceptable" as the flow of migrants from Macedonia and Greece continued.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to be hurt by this process.
In the coming days, we will have to hold talks with Brussels and other countries", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The tension on the Hungarian-Serbian border came just a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at its meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who attacked Greece and Italy, and expressed hope that by the end of next month or year, an agreement would be reached to admit 120,000 more migrants, including those from Hungary, to EU countries.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an EU summit next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
Hungary, on the other hand, is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbors will take any concrete steps on the issue.
The emergency call in the two southern regions on Tuesday gives authorities broad powers to deal with the crisis, including closing roads if necessary and speeding up cases involving refugees.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he planned to pull the strap along the Romanian border to stop the flow of migrants from that country after the country's spine wire to Serbia.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were assigned to the spine-wire project between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a significant narrow passageway and transit point for the European Union, and many of these migrants are refugees fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant that the vast majority of immigrants who arrive are "economically motivated migrants" who are trying to cross into Europe for a better life rather than innocent people who have fled war - a view that is in stark contrast to that of other EU countries, including Germany.
Hungary's midnight laws make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13 foot) long thorny line that crosses the Serbian border, but also impose heavier penalties on human traffickers.
Speaking to reporters in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency due to the situation caused by mass migration".
Our point is clear: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
While the deployment of troops has yet to be approved by the legislature, Associated Press reporters in the area say they have seen dogs and vehicles equipped with heavy weapons here for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities had arrested 15 people who had crossed the border and tried to cross the border.
They passed by damaging thorny wire, now under police supervision and charged with criminal offences under new laws.
The authorities are quickly repairing the thorny wires.
Hungarian authorities also used a train wagon covered with spiky wires to close one of the crossing points, while on Tuesday morning they closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia.
The Hungarians were also busy with the operation of a small metal container filled with people to carry out operations, and the chaos was reflected at the main border crossing near Roszke.
Twenty people were able to get in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of migrants closed the highway between Serbia and Hungary and said they would not accept food and water supplies until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders is halved in the national election
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still a two-digit leader in the Democratic nomination race, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton currently holds 47 percent of the Democratic vote (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he's running for president, receives 15 percent of the Democratic vote.
More than five months before the primary began, most Democrats said it was too early to decide which candidate to support.
But Clinton's supporters have a stronger view of their own choices than other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has some gains.
Clinton leads the way with a big difference between women and moderates, but that gap is closing.
The men's support has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind him.
Clinton's Democratic under-50 electoral advantage has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now on a par.
But Clinton is a big difference in the way the old voters are.
Clinton was two-digit ahead of Sander among the Liberals last month, but now Sanders is five points ahead of that group.
About half of the Democratic voters nationwide say they will passionately support Clinton if the party is a candidate.
One quarter supports him on certain terms, while another 15 percent will support him only if he's a candidate.
One in six percent doesn't support Clinton.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters tend to support her particularly passionately.
The views among those who do not support Clinton at the moment are even more complicated - only a quarter can support her passionately.
48 percent of Democrats say they will passionately support Clinton, while fewer Republican candidates are talking about Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters were asked open-ended questions about why they wanted Clinton to run, the first-ranked answers were that she had the right experience (16 percent), that it was time to elect a woman president (13 percent), and that she was the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also expressed their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Conciliation in problems and selectivity are among the criteria.
As a potential vice president for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic voters might want to see him in the race, but a third don't.
When Democratic voters are asked what the second candidate for the party is, Biden is on top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden could easily have a second term, according to Sander.
If Biden does not run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases; Biden's 20 points in a race increases to 30 points in a race where Biden is not.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats see Clinton as the best candidate to win the general election, but that number dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden, who is second from this perspective, is far behind, but the percentage of those who see him as the most eligible candidate has increased.
Again, when asked what's most important about a candidate, the Democratic voters put the issue of eligibility before the issue of eligibility.
Similarly last month, no Democratic candidate or candidate appears to be unacceptable to these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well among the primary voters of their parties in some key characteristics.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and strong leadership skills.
Biden is the first of the three in terms of honesty, while Clinton is strong in leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats say Clinton is not honest and unreliable, about half of them say the same for Sanders (15 percent), while 27 percent have no idea.
Democratic voters also generally view Clinton, Sanders and Biden in the same direction as their own ideology.
By all accounts, a quarter of the Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders.
While questions persist about his use of personal email address and server during his State Department duties, most Democrats voters find the statement satisfactory and note that their views on the matter were not affected.
But that's a different story in the general American public.
Half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, while only a third find them satisfying.
Public opinion on the issue was divided in March, shortly after the issue was brought to the fore.
Most Americans say that the email quarrels have not affected their overall views on Clinton, while the negative views have increased by 36 percent.
These are Republicans in general, and more than six out of 10 say they have a bad view of Clinton.
Although Clinton is seen by her party's voters as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem among registered voters in general: Only 32% consider her honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't find him honest or trustworthy.
And 55 percent of registered voters across the country don't think Trump is honest or trustworthy.
Yet both Clinton and Trump are getting good grades for leadership.
Among the six candidates who took part in the test, Biden, Carson and Bush got the best honesty scores.
More often than not, Sanders is honest, but like Carson, most people have no idea about him.
The margin of error on the sample from 351 Democratic voters is 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in the national polls.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that about half of the two candidates voted in favor of the game, with the other candidates having little chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, up from 23% in the latest CBS poll before the debate on Fox News last month, to 27% in the poll announced Tuesday.
But support for Carson rose from 6 percent to 23 percent over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson did very well in demographic groups, with support among college-educated Republican voters far higher than Trump.
The remaining support, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, has now dropped to 2 percent from 10 percent last month.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6 percent.
This latest poll of 376 Republican voters has a margin of error of 6 percent and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's support among Republicans was 19 percent, right behind Trump's 32 percent support.
The most recent poll by ABC News/Washington Post has seriously put Trump in front of Carson.
Trump, facing Carson's rise last week, continued to randomly wave to his retired brain surgeon, even though Carson apologized for questioning Trump's beliefs.
At a campaign stop in Iowa last Saturday, Trump said, "We need energy".
Five fraternities are charged with the murder of a first-grade student at Baruch College
Five people were indicted for murder nearly two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity admissions month in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity severely assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a launch ceremony in September 2013, and contributed to his death by delaying his hospital transport, according to police.
Officials reported that he had his eyes closed, a 30-pound backpack full of sand hung from his back, and he was constantly wearing a thumb belt as he tried to walk toward the target in a frozen area.
Mr. Deng complained that he had a headache and later lost consciousness.
The Pi Delta Psi fraternity members didn't call 911 after Deng passed out, and police said they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But according to police commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at a press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, searched for his symptoms on Google and contacted the national president of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, for advice.
Commissioner Wagner said that at this point, members began to hide their personal belongings and put the good of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng.
He couldn't be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered trauma from repeated blows to his head, body, and hip with a non-acute object.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement that many families have collapsed as a result of fraternity admissions ceremonies, with at least one student dying at admissions ceremonies every year since 1970.
The brotherhood and its members must be held accountable for this, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe City grand jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal misconduct.
Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday that not only would we hold those involved, but if there were any organizations that officially or informally confirmed this, they would be held accountable.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity ended its association with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?
With interest rates rising, the bull market is flat, bond yields are rising, and the economy is falling.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take.
History, especially in economics, offers little information about timing.
The recession lasted for 86 months, as the recession lasted for 11 months after the first rate of interest rate increase.
The Fed's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has been, if not continuously, often decisive in the response of the economy and financial assets.
This is why U.S. central bank officials have emphasized that investors should focus on the duration of the normalization process rather than when interest rates start to rise.
It's a fact that there are different variables.
But the result may be that market participants think that the interest rate hike has been exaggerated.
In a note to clients, Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, said: "The Fed's first interest rate hike since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as signaling the end of the 'cheap money' era".
On the contrary, we don't expect U.S. interest rates to gradually return to normal, but it seems that the seismic shock that most of the levels still fear is the lowest.
But we can't say it won't have any effect.
Based on past trends, some sectors of the economy may react as follows:
As has been seen in the market in recent months, expecting interest rates to rise can temporarily destabilize things.
Even when interest rates are raised, the effect is less obvious.
In a new study of what will happen after the Fed increases, Deutsche Bank analysts say "it appears that the yields of natural resources are trending to stand still for 12-24 months after the first interest rate hike, which may reflect the stagnation in monetary policy".
According to a recent analysis by Bob Doll of Nuveen Asset Management analysts, shared at Barron's, the market has generally seen sharp increases over the past 35 years - around 14 percent - and after 250 days it is moving in a straight line towards interest rate increases (an average increase of 2.6 percent) and after 500 days it has returned to normal, yielding an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the effect on shares was more pronounced in the later stages of the interest rate cycle and yields were failing.
Tensions are a reality of economic life, but interest rate hikes help them too.
The Fed is facing some current, pre-existing conditions that will accelerate the downturn.
The most striking thing is that the unprecedented domestic yield is at its lowest level yet for Fed interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 percent increase since 1950 has only doubled to below 4.5 percent in nominal year-on-year gross domestic product.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, the Atlanta Fed estimates that this is expected to be permanent, with the third quarter at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, raising interest rates in such a delicate economic environment can be risky and raise the question "will it be different this time around?"
Market participants have been waiting for the Fed to raise interest rates for a year at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends Thursday.
While most strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, futures trading only suggests a 25 percent chance.
The report noted that "in our research since 1950, all growth cycles occurring to date are in a super upward trend cycle and reaching pre-recovery peaks rapidly after recovery, with uncountable domestic yields".
Rather, it was a slow recovery, without the worst recession of any model period.
The current cycle was the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the last recession -- the longest cycle on record was 35 months, and the cycle we're in is still in its 74th month.
The market is expected to increase interest rates, but the income is stable, and the order is somewhat like your own.
The difference is that when the Fed changes course, the effect is seen faster than in stocks.
When the first round of inflation/depression occurs, bond yields do not immediately change direction.
At the end of the interest rate cycle, bond yields drop instantly", Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab's strategists, interest rate increases will bring the yields between longer and shorter-term bonds closer together to level the slope.
We analyzed that high yield bonds usually perform better in a setting like this, but Kathy Jones, one of the Schwab analysts, said, "We're still careful about getting the return".
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapting to the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and falling inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is regulated according to tighter monetary policy", he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, yield curves are right, credit spreads are expanding, and volatility is rising - all of the features that will be seen in the market when the Fed tights policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do most of their business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and more attractive local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off because rising dollar prices will make their products more expensive on the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report for their clients: "History shows that 'quality' stocks can experience underperformance at the beginning of such a surge".
Companies with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percent following the 1994, 1999 and 2004 rate increases.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility stocks also outperformed their low-quality competitors (percent) by an average of 4 to 3 per cent.
The debt will become a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies with high volatility debt are the ones most likely to suffer.
In addition to the pure stock market game, consumers are predicted to benefit from the rising dollar.
Although experts differ on how fast to keep, savers can also profit from high gains.
Andrew Bingham said it was a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accused the station of "becoming a fool"
He argued that radio was becoming increasingly unlike commercial competitors
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, accusing him of throwing the British Awards.
His lawyer, Damien Collins, accused The Voice of being unoriginal.
A prominent spokesman pressured the broadcaster to highlight its differences from other commercial stations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was increasingly "turning to Classic FM".
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said the BBC's public service broadcaster was "growing" and was becoming increasingly uncommon among its commercial rivals.
"I don't like to use that description, but Radio 3 has 'become old', it's becoming more and more Classic FM", he said.
It also targeted the first BBC Music Awards last December.
It's just another version of the BBC Music Awards, the British Awards, which were launched last year.
Bingham said, "So if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to mind, and you're just copying the same thing that's already on the market".
The BBC's director-general denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was clearly ahead of its commercial rivals in terms of both live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn anything about classical music anywhere else.
And that's the commitment to live music, and making music is unlike anything else.
He also said that I think Radio 3's efforts to explore new music and promote their work are also very important.
Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, earlier this year argued that radio should work more than ever before to reach a wider audience, because Britons were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only component to be retained in the ball as it was pushed to the tail of the BBC's commercial rivals at the Culture, Media and Sport Selection Committee meeting.
Tory Damien Collins, a member of Parliament, also took part in the O Voice - BBC's music talent competition, which he won for 22 million pounds from Dutch production company Talpa Media.
Can't you see why the program is so loud, because it's not original and it's not special?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show, which was judged by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was made "in a style specific to the BBC".
He said he wanted the organization to "find a hit out of his own blood" before he could do another entertainment show.
However, he also did not accept the idea that in the future, he would be prevented from producing more of the Voice program or that the amount spent on licensing fees would be spent on other formats.
Is it because of the lowest ever rise in internet sales in August?
Internet sales increased seven percent in the first three months of 2015
Last month saw the lowest growth since 2000 when records began to break .
Three years ago , when mobile devices were first used in shopping , there was an explosion in Internet sales .
Experts say Black Friday in November could be a factor in spending cuts
Online shopping has been booming for over a decade, turning Britain's most vibrant shopping streets into ghost towns.
After figures showing an increase of only seven percent in online sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say that online sales are showing signs of weakening.
Total spending in August was only up five percent from last year, and it was the lowest growth since 2000, when records began to break.
After figures showing an increase of only seven percent in Internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say Internet sales are showing signs of weakening
Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG's sales index, told the Guardian: "If you look at the growth rates of the past few years, and especially 2000 you actually see that things are back to normal over time".
He added that three years ago, when consumers started using mobile phones to buy products, internet sales were up.
That meant more people could shop even while lying in a chair.
But now it's going down, you can see it coming down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept that originated in America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts say that consumers may be waiting for the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November, to buy something.
When last year's event saw five times more consumers attack corporate websites to get cheap products than the previous year, many companies' websites crashed.
Experts say that Black Friday's shoppers may be "for now" frozen, suggesting shoppers are fighting for discounts
A study published by the British Retailers' Association found that 1 pound for every 5 pounds spent shopping is spent buying products online.
One third of some products, such as TVs and washing machines, are now available in online stores.
More than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of on the high street.
Muslims say goodbye to those killed in the wreckage in Mecca after the Bin Laden family was found guilty
Muslims moved the bodies of 29 people who lost their lives in the streets after the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the wreckage
The health ministry said 394 people were injured after the tornado.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the bodies of 29 people who died after a car crumbled into the Masjid al-Haram.
The crowd, mostly white, closed their roads to say goodbye to their final journeys to the Muayyim Cemetery in Mecca.
The grief-stricken crowd passed the holy place where a few days ago a screw tore down the roof of a mosque and toppled the pilgrims.
The bodies of 394 people were brought to the funeral after the Saudi kingdom took responsibility for the family of Binladin, the owner of a construction holding.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who lost their lives after a windmill fell on the mosque were carried along the road
Among the dead was November Akram, a father of four from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the cranks fell.
Mr. Akram had come to the Holy Mosque with his parents at the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi leaders have announced that the Hajj will continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
In his speech today, King Salman said that Binladin Holding Group should not leave the arm of the winch open when it is out of use.
The Arabic version of the order, prepared by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, stated that the only party to be charged in connection with the incident was the Millennium Group.
The English-language service of the news agency did not provide details, but the company's officials were informed that a ban on travel abroad was imposed.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed that the widow would find a reason to overthrow the courtyard of the Holy Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had come to Hajj at the end of the month.
The group of thousands made no statement regarding the overturned crane and their representatives were not allowed to comment.
The Royal Decree accused the group of failing to take up-to-date security measures and of not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
The surrounding area of the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of crane, most of which are under the administration of the group of the Bindad.
The Binladin family has been in close contact with the Saudi ruling family for decades, and is the name of many construction projects.
Al Qaeda's last leader, Osama Bin Laden, was also the son of a pervert whose family forbade him from adopting.
The accident occurred just days before millions of people flocked to the Hajj land, which every adult Muslim is supposed to visit at least once in his life, during a period of strong winds and rain.
Officials said 158 people were still in hospital.
Authorities ordered the families of the deceased and survivors with permanent disabilities to receive 1 million rials (£174,000) in compensation.
The other wounded will get half that amount.
The B&Q boss says that the East European craftsmen behind this trend are working cheaply.
Veronique Laury says the British are hiring more and more craftsmen
This increase is driven by the number of Eastern European craftsmen
This has resulted in 200 more Screwfix stores targeting artisans.
Kingfisher is also closing 60 B&Q outlets nationwide.
Written by Rupert Steiner, City Chief of the Daily Mail
It is said that instead of leaving the hammers and paintbrushes in their hands , the British began to hire skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do their homework
If you're good at using a hammer or painting walls, you're in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, Britons are hiring more and more craftsmen to do DIY at home.
Veronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, owner of the home improvement chain, said that behind this trend was a huge increase in the number of skilled East European artisans offering services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores for artisans while closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury said she wanted more women hired at B&Q stores because eight of the ten purchase decisions in the store were made by women.
The majority of the staff is male.
She said the single woman who has done more home improvement than in the past is a need to meet the emerging demographic trends.
Mrs. Laury said: "The majority of our stores are still men.
We need to strike a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions about products are made by women.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
One of the five women to lead the FTSE100, Ms. Laury has restructured her senior team to include an equal number of men and women CEOs.
Kingfisher is almost alone in this field with a full 50 percent female staff, including CEO and CFO.
"It was a conscious decision", said Mrs. Laury, "diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women to take on our board.
After the group charged the cost of the stores closing, Kingfisher announced a decline in both quarterly profits and sales.
As a result of the trend, Screwfix and B&Q owner Kingfisher will open 200 new stores
It 's time for the Fed to decide on interest rate hikes .
The U.S. Central Bank's two-day meetings on Wednesday and Thursday are being watched by the world, with a decision to raise interest rates expected in a decade.
In a Reuters poll, just over half of the 80 economists said last week that the Fed would implement the measure, but now they think it will suspend it and keep rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
It's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
"For the first time", said Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, "we will witness a major central bank go from zero to normalizing interest rates".
The U.S. economy is performing relatively well, and in the process of economic recovery, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet, creating a small amount of inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less promising global picture.
Markets have warned of a rise, but there are signs that they believe the situation will not allow such a rise.
The verdict will be announced Thursday at 8:00.
The killer of Delta State University left an apology letter.
Authorities said Tuesday that Shannon Lamb left a note saying she was "fit" for the first murder after shooting her girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning and later that day before killing her coworker.
Mississippi Gautier police said Lamb, a geography and social science instructor at Delta State University, called 911 at 10:00 a.m.
Monday and said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the officer on the phone he should send the police.
"I killed my wife last night", Lamb said, adding that he was "a sweet dog that didn't hurt anyone" and was probably sorry.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't say his name.
Lamb has made no statement about the murder.
When police arrived at the scene, they encountered the lifeless body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take the time back.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing this note, Lamb drove to Delta State, 300 miles away, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, then committed suicide when police pulled him over.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it was obvious that something was going on in Lamb's mind".
Although reports emerged on Monday that Lamb believed that his girlfriend Prentiss also had an emotional affair with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that they had "no information or evidence" that he had a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as "a good person".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, and she was "in a broken state".
O'Steen also noted that Prentiss and her daughter were "certainly each other's best friends".
Linsday Knowless, described by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Parentiss, said that Prentiss was working online from his home.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owns a hunting dog named Lightning, has been with Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "He always loved helping others".
Police said Lamb called his family on Monday and said, "I'm not going to jail".
That night, when police approached him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled him aside, jumped on foot, ran into the forest area, and shot himself with a gun.
According to the university's online resume, Lamb received her doctorate in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that lost their former charm
The actor (left), seen with his son Redmond (right), has had a rather stressful few years.
In 2001, she battled leukemia, and in 2009, she gave up her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor, who is also said to have a drug problem, was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All of this, of course, hurt him a lot.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months with a broken pair.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two broken legs in a Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
This event, which has caused the defender to cry, will leave him off the field for at least six months, while Louis van Gaal remains hopeful that Shaw can return to the field this season.
The offense was caused by 20-year-old Shaw's careless entrance with Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute of the match, when he dropped a bomb on the pitch.
He was intercepted for nine minutes and then had to be oxygenated before being transported to the hospital.
"He broke his double leg and is in the hospital right now", Van Gaal said.
Today or a day later, maybe he'll be shipped off and operated on in Manchester.
It's a terrible situation - a young man who's transferred to Manchester at the age of 18, has a hard time, then he's got a great game, and then this happens to him.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it means at least six months, and it means you can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky enough to get rid of the red card and the hair on his penalty shoot-out.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official made a mistake.
You can judge yourself when I say it's a penalty and a red card.
It was a terrible fight with two legs.
"Thank you all for your messages, there are no words to describe how much I've been disappointed, my recovery journey is now beginning, I'll be back strong".
Interviewer: Luke Shaw is in shock from his injury in the Manchester United PSV defeat
The Champions League in France next July will be a morale booster for the English defender.
Phillip Cocu, technical director of PSV, said, "It's a very bad injury".
If an injury like this happens to any player, everyone's sorry.
Our players never intend to disable their opponent.
Moreno also suffered a broken leg while playing for Van Gaal's Mexico team against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
Son said he finds this very difficult because he never intended to disable his opponent, and it never got better after he heard it was a terrible break.
I couldn't see that moment.
All I could see was a ball going in a different direction, like Moreno touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's swing.
Moreno told SBS 6: "I know how it feels.
I feel so bad about this and I'm so sorry.
He was hospitalized after a fight with Chris Smalling in Andrés Guardado, PSV.
Of course David Cameron knows The Lorax better than that?
And this is something every parent learns in a short time: when your child loves a book, you know that it's going to take you almost no time to memorize it.
It seems that if you're not David Cameron.
When asked by a childcare holiday programmer provider what his favorite children's book was, the prime minister chose The Lorax, a 1971 outlandish environmental tale by Dr. Seuss.
Cameron, writing in a message on the SuperCamps website that this was a difficult decision, continues: "This book, with a comical, moving, creative, and powerful message, contains an image or message that we always skip, so I like to read to my children".
So far, everything has been going pretty well, until Cameron wrote something about the book's content, but actually added new characters and details to inflate the original story line, which is the 2012 film version of the book.
In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has disappeared, where even air is the stuff, a boy named Ted writes that he wants to fulfill his desire to see a real tree to win the heart of the girl of his dreams Audrey, incorporating into the story an unknown love story of Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If that's not suspicious enough, Cameron's text in the Internet Film Archive bears a striking resemblance to the short summary of The Lora, which begins: "In Thneed-Ville, a walled city where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a girl named Ted wants to win the heart of Audrey's childhood dream".
Given the claims of a native parent, Cameron is unlikely to be unaware of the main plot of the book, where he hears an unnamed young boy being destroyed by the greedy, tree-cutting, crying Once, despite the objections of the local environment, the bearded, moustached and "tree-speaking" creature named Lorax, who gave the book its name.
Probably this weak PR case was handed over to a corporal who apparently didn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokeswoman for the presidency said the text is believed to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but has not commented otherwise.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of being expelled by England, but he was still healthy.
It's a tough task to play Pakistan in the UAE, but I don't think the cards show a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat that happened last time after seeing the British team selected for the tour.
I'm not going to rule out a run-off victory, though.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than three years ago, but they have players who are well on the line and a strong collective game-playing mentality, which does not heal the injuries of 2012, but only provides some youth-based optimism.
In the ball game, Moeen Ali is developing as a game changer and Adil Rashid represents an attack option even if the quality is unknown at Test level.
Related: Adam Lyth left the England Test team and was replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to fire Adam Lyth is a difficult one for me as head coach at Yorkshire to analyze.
The Seven Tests were against two good batsmen under difficult conditions, and the simple but inevitable fact is that cricketers are judged by their results.
For example, there was no question mark on Joe Root, and he had to be announced because - as I said before - players were their best choices.
After a few fifty-issue series, Lyth could see his career extended, but he decided his own fate.
If he works harder for Yorkshire, I hope he'll take another chance.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player's attitude, which didn't surprise me, even though he didn't perform well, and he was a team man.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it takes a test runner to get a grade.
Lyth -- like Sam Robson before him -- got seven caps, Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play a match.
The only pain you may feel is that Jonathan Trott may have been the first to go to the Caribbean with England - when Lyth's form was at its peak - but the opportunity to waste that time is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and I think he's a top-notch hitter.
A cricketer of the X-factor, and we saw that in Yorkshire when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge earlier this season.
At least it should be available for the same opportunity as before, but that depends on the team formation in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen hitting the opening shot with Cook to get him an extra game spin while holding four quicks worked, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a batsman can't shoot here, and this left-hander has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen could have done his job for Worcestershire, but he's a number three for them, and it's not much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests in his first fall before he started his 2001 debut.
He caught the three-hundred series right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup and surprises me as an impressive young man in my limited interviews with him.
People can see the raw stats -- 31 on average and 35 on average -- and think it's a drag, but there aren't many game-changers that can raise their hands, and player selections have been made since they were young.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, it seems England has made some clever additions to its coaching staff.
It would be a wise move to appoint Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for Test matches.
One of the most adorable men in the game, he will bring with him a wealth of experience against all odds and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the round-white ball foot and he's giving the game a relentless streak of energy and rhythm.
I always thought he was born for the international cricket world, whether he was a player or a coach, and he has a mindset that can be guided like Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even messages that have been said before, can bring a new twist to the team.
Colly's team-mate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is being suspended for a day's play, Root's been given a similar break against Australia, and I'm okay with that.
While not everyone agrees, plans aren't made by those who choose the players, the coaches, and the players.
And you must remember that, like the players, their work depends on the outcome.
Decisions like this are never easy to make.
If the economy stagnates by 2017, Brexit camp could win
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and this is despite Jeremy "Yes or No?"
The aliens have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a fellow European diplomat said that some member states are tired of Britain's agenda of divisive privileges and irreconcilable treaty changes, which are not entirely their fault.
At the annual meeting of TUC in Brighton, it decided that it would not want them if they were to harm social protection.
In fact, we could call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves in front of the famous monuments there, whether they are prominent or not, and then they return to their countries and say they have gathered allies for reform.
It's all about me.
When Berlin said "Don't leave us alone with France", my European friend who wanted a Britain outside the EU tent said that the increasingly short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals had reached a point where they no longer cared about us staying.
Germany's cautious and sane chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an ally, despite having been in power for 10 years, and wants to leave before things get worse, as in the case of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande faces re-election or a change of power in France in 2017.
It's a breathing force.
Soon a right-wing nationalist government will take power in Poland and a left-wing government in Spain.
It's unlikely that these countries will show any effort for the Selfie Britons who need to use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom because they don't want to either because most of them are separatist.
So some of these ministers might be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements that won't help this situation during the 2017 UK referendum campaign, like the Scottish National Party, my friend says.
"There was no way out of renegotiation" and "Britain got nothing to benefit from renegotiation".
Europeans know from their previous experience how exploitative, oligarchic the barons of Fleet Street are, how anti-EU they are, because they were not in the time of Tony Benn, who inspired the 1975 referendum that approved our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2 to 1.
This is how they remember Boris Johnson, the leading euro-opportunist, who was a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s, and who made his name by the name of "EU flat bananas".
Except for all the nonsense, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were tax evasion, foreigners listening to illegal phones, and so-called foreigners who owned most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair, on the other hand, often thought the same thing about this, but when a fierce gorilla was trapped in a cage, he realized he had to distract him by giving him bananas to avoid having to eat at lunchtime and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was Blairist than Blair in opposing Cameron's brilliant referendum idea, as Blair had agreed to a principle on the EU constitution that was repealed in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave him a exit card.
The press never forgave him for that.
But as I said to Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted my back at Westminster on Monday -- and he has no time to lose to me -- it seems that Neil Kinnock, who was then and is now a mistake, and Murdoch in the '80s, is in danger of re-adopting his strategy of boycotting.
It will take time, but he needs to develop a consistent strategy to communicate with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC chair on Sunday, not with me, but with the media.
I'm kind of describing Corbyn's official position in Europe as developing.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most people who are left out of the hostile Ukip tendency and the ardent supporters of Conservative Little Britain say yes.
After all, that's what Hilary Benn, "a Benn but not a Bennite", said on radio and television this week, because she naively forced herself not to accept that it was a bad idea for Corbyn to appoint John McDonnell as shadow chancellor.
It reminded me of his father's fight on television in the 1970s to betray his colleagues in the workers' cabinet, not going far enough and losing his cabinet position.
Hilary's fight was more appealing.
But, in Benn's words, fighting to stay "in all conditions" was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to the Lords at a special meeting on Monday night.
And considering that you touched me, the detail-genre that Corbyn was trying to convey, whatever the year-round image, continues to maintain the importance of message discipline in the age of 24/7 TV, and especially in the social media landscape of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it's reasonable to challenge the Europeans, which guarantees Cameron the support of the Labour Party in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's move to align with the Bennite siege economy and anti-capitalist backgrounds of EU membership is no longer just a matter of debate among left-wing opponents who are the cornerstones of the doctrinal fray of narcissism of minor differences.
As with his transition to NATO -- Tom Watson is determined that JC will not campaign for a secession -- foreign diplomats will have to try to make sense of it for their masters in their countries.
Why would Paris or Berlin lose political capital on British privileges, which they could all throw away?
As I was told at the opening of the UK Impact Security Forum on Monday, the US is already very disappointed with the poor performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria despite the cost-cutting Conservative Party government in power.
Experts criticize public health research into e-cigarettes
In a 12-person meeting of government-funded agencies with tobacco industry associates, researchers claimed that e-cigarettes were 95 percent less harmful than smoking.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in the UK Public Health (PHE) report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published its report last month, which it described as a "turning point" in its "detailed examination of evidence".
But some researchers questioned the validity of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month's headline of the Lancet medical journal targeted "a remarkably decaying foundation" based on the main finding of PHE.
Two other researchers in the BMJ questioned whether the claims were "built on sand or rock".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of effectiveness".
They said they expected PHE's claims that "e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than the best estimate available" to be based on a detailed examination of evidence and modeling.
In fact, it emerges from a 12-person meeting that gathered to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting, the CEO, was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent research.
They also said that he approved BAT's public health promotional document in a sustainability report.
They also said that one of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but that it was not previously reported to have received funding from the Philip Morris International tobacco company.
The panelists were not given details on how they were selected, but they included some of the known giants of e-cigarettes who reported on the industry background in the article.
Some of the others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco executive at PHE was also present.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research paper "effectively" acknowledged that there was "lack of concrete evidence of the harmfulness of most products by many criteria".
But none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said that the claims that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers" were too early.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellness at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been answered earlier.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking".
One in two people who have a lifelong addiction to tobacco dies from it.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small compared to their long-term effects, but we should continue to study them.
PHE has a clear mission: to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in an era when there is a lot of confusion about the harm it does when compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
We are fulfilling our national responsibility by making clear the evidence that e-cigarettes -- even if they are not harmless -- carry only a small fraction of the harm caused by smoking.
Former Channel 4 boss says BBC should leave EastEnders
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and that ad competitors could "give their right hands" for hit programmes such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make programs that are not made by other British publishers.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programmes on channels such as BBC4 that were likely to be watched by a smaller audience, against their rivals' highest-rated programmes at valuable intervals.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the organisation wanted to collaborate more with other organisations, Johnson said that in his time at Channel 4 he had tried unsuccessfully for six years to establish a link with the BBC.
Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee during a question about the BBC's future, "I challenge the idea that the BBC should order and broadcast programmes that can be shown by openly unsubsidised competitors".
If you're going to continue to apply a license fee that I'm not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, then at least you should reduce your output to programs that others haven't done or ordered.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to provide the broadest possible support for the future.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else will publish it, which is ridiculous and obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why programs that can be funded without help should be funded at a reduced rate of tax.
One is The Voice, and EastEnders is another, and it's actually made in-house.
To be honest, other channels are willing to lend their right arm to this.
I'm trying to see how the public service is doing.
I don't think that's going to diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, blamed the BBC's ratings pursuit on "the passion of the people who work here and the fact that these employees see this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support".
His comments on the BBC's most popular programmes echo those of Tony Ball, a former Sky administrator who used the MacTaggart class in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose the BBC sell programmes such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programmes went to BBC4 and that viewership measurement could not be done here, but that they could be discussed to continue their demonstrative piety duties of providing a £4 billion licence fee income for tax exemption, adding: "We also, of course, make all these silent programmes that nobody is watching".
They put them in spaces that no one will ever see.
On the fees, Johnson told the committee: "I invite you to find a more regressive system for those who benefit the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think, £150 a year is a huge amount of money, but I wonder if the reason for people who have £150 is a lot of money for them to do this is because they don't watch too much BBC.
David Elstein, the former Sky and Channel 5 executive who testified to the committee on Tuesday, also said the BBC should review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that some of the output of the BBC is now officially classified as education - that's 1% of TV output and 0.1% of radio output - and that public service broadcasting in Australia and Canada should be a front for that and that it should be replaced with "information, enlightenment and education".
On the partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do something about only a handful of proms shown on TV and collaborate with advertisers to ensure they're all online.
'Sonogenic' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows the wolves changing directions when they are struck by sound vibrations.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny wolves change direction when they are hit by sound vibrations at a frequency that humans cannot hear.
The vibrations are triggered by activating genetically engineered motor neurons that carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers reading and writing brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms have proven the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, which allows ultrasound to be used to activate a range of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Researcher Sreekanth Chalasani of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an interventional procedure that gives electrical vibrations into people's brains to treat Parkinson's symptoms.
Wrinkles don't usually respond beyond sound, but Chalasani found that they respond when surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he found amplify the transsonic waves, allowing the worms to pass through.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect structures located in the membranes of some worm cells, called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report in Nature Communications, sound waves enable these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To create sound-controlled threaded wolves, Chalasani genetically altered the worms to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied the sound to the mutated creatures, the sound waves were amplified by micro-worms and transmitted to the worms, where they activated the mutated motor neurons.
This procedure has similarities to optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that enables scientists to activate and shut down neurons by light radiation.
But Chalasani says that sonogenesis may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that must be sent through an optical fiber to a desired point in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue unimpeded and thus be sent through the skull into the brain.
Chalasani said "we believe that through gene therapy and a curative virus, human neurons targeted in clinical settings for specific neurological treatments can be temporarily made sensitive to the sound signals".
He added that other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements condemning the arms trade in Britain
Watch the video of the Amnesty International anti-arms fair.
The most horrible killer drones!
The prongs that tear your ankle apart!
The bombs are a piece of shit!
And electric shock pockets that cause intense pain but leave no trace!
The fine audio and cartoon footage produced for Amnesty International, produced by the British government to highlight its desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the ExCel Centre for Defence and Security at the London Dock International, leaves no doubt that the world's largest arms fair is a vicious hoax.
DSEI arms fair: authoritarian regimes attacking London
But a different campaign is going on with posters at bus stops and subway trains, requiring double-checking.
One of them uses London Underground fonts and brands to transform the DLR line into a tank, saying, "The important message is, will you travel in the DLR between September 15 and 18?"
This September, a pack of arms dealers will attack DLR... and customers are being asked to help stop this arms fair.
300 posters from artists exhibiting at Bansky's Museum of Cruel Design in Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it using "Advertising Area Strike Packages", which cost £6 and claimed to "provide access to about a third of the advertising areas of the bus station on the planet".
Transport for London was not pleased with the "vandalism" of this poster.
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Design and faculty member at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questionable every day and are looking for ways to bring their political work to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists are joining activists in protest movements and are beginning to realize that their art must come out into the real world to have an impact on society.
Another anti- arms trafficking poster is showing up for travelers on the subway.
The Amnesty International video was viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the free-to-air advertising agency VCCP, and was made free by the graphic designer and sound artist.
Matt Lever, the creative director of the VCCP, was surprised by the silence over the gun show ads - with empty space on the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's get them a campaign they're trying to escape".
They played with the idea of a more realistic, cunning corporate advertising, but "decorated with bright colors and animation, it became more noticeable".
Tom Davies of Amnesty International said: "They have been very helpful in raising concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair".
What we need now is for the British government to act and prevent the illegal sale of torture equipment outside our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art in the gun fair comes from the ExCeL inside, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover products.
In a press release, Saab showed the order of the US military "AT4CS RS fired from the arrow".
It includes a "unusual shape and armor that hits the target with a massive blow".
Whatever he's doing, it's not gonna be nice.
Eight golden rules for living in student homes
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory as an uninterested 19-year-old, and I still believe in the berries and moral relativity, but now I remember the fake smiles of the ones I bothered - and the countless long complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be summed up in the eight golden rules.
Moving home can range from a nervous breakdown to complete horror.
The seduction of gossip: where people are from, where they haven't lost the year, where they insist on Corbyn, and why you're "obviously neither loving nor hating Marmite because really, gentlemen, it's just yeast extract HAHAHAH I'll be in my room".
Take a breath.
And let the others have one -- ask questions and show the relative.
It'll guide the conversation and help you distinguish what you like from people you won't talk to even if your eyelashes are on and they're bored with the fire extinguisher.
Give people some space.
People's rooms often turn into a drinking booth, movie night space and social gathering places, but these are also places where people dress and set up their underwear.
Related: Don 't even think about starting a relationship at university
Interns get treated badly at the university.
Your room may be an inpatient facility, but many dormitory halls foster a culture of inter-room hanging, which is open to friendly, social and lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture will allow you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to last, but I need you to go away for a while so I can replace the energy I spent communicating with you".
Try to sense that a friend is tired of socializing and perhaps text instead of knocking.
When I say knock, do it.
A friend at the student home had a policy of being invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He's seen a lot.
Don't make friends by cooking.
Since you started college at the height of the food-contest craze, it's been less strange to introduce yourself by knocking on people's doors with a plate of brownie, and it's been less 1950s "welcome to our neighborhood, I've cooked you something, now I'll smile when you ask personal questions".
Giving people homemade presents is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk and perhaps associate your face with a sweet surprise.
It's about you being a good cook.
A badly mixed dough, a dough, a sugar and a fat, will make people pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in boarding schools.
Well, frankly, it's stealing someone's chicken, but stealing a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the milkman twice.
He'll probably tell you to take care of yourself, even if he's swimming in it.
It's very uncomfortable for someone to steal your stuff, and I understand you, but try to handle this more maturely than my roommate, who put liquid soap in to punish the milk thief.
He's in jail now.
Don't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent person, but because you're the einsans in glass houses.
A girl in my hallway pressed the next-door neighbor and said to cut the drums a little bit because it was 3:00 in the evening and she had her morning test.
His answers were to make it louder.
When they finally closed at 5 a.m., she opened her own music and locked the door, and kindly allowed them to sleep for two hours before going to her own three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife moved in the same hallway as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be strange to misunderstand a friend in the hallway and think she's your future wife, and then hang out and leave and have to see her every day and watch your partner capture?
Of course, that's kind of nice, but if your fiery corridor neighbor is definitely not your future wife, at least talk to the kid and recommend common sense.
When you find yourself in a happy moment that someone left their keys inside without locking the door, know that the line between a joke and bullying is thinner than you thought.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to come back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun safety lesson by hiding your belongings, but never soak someone's room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in the freezer with a glass of water, but don't stick your stuff to the ceiling more than twice.
The president of the council of immigrants to the Netherlands

Her heart stopped when she was getting pretty
Raquel Santos, 28, a mother of two living in Rio de Janeiro, went to her aesthetic doctor last Monday to remove the smile marks on her lips.
The woman, who had the filler injected into her face, had a heart attack and breathing quickened after a while.
Then he died of cardiac arrest.
Police are investigating whether the woman's daily use of a drug called "Potenay" was involved in her death.
The cause of death will be determined after the autopsy.
In a statement to the Brazilian press, model's closest friend Debora Azevedo said Santos, whose two sons, ages 7 and 13, were obsessed with cosmetic surgery.
Santos was the second to compete in Brazil's most important beauty pageant, Musa do Brasil, last December.
Oil companies are officially in shambles
From 2014 when oil prices began to fall, to the end of last year, when investment of about $400 billion was delayed, the deepest oil exploration projects were suspended.
According to research by consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have caused the suspension of $380 billion in oil and gas exploration/production projects, while millions of barrels of production from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa have been delayed across a wide geography.
The report, which shows oil prices falling to their lowest level in 12 years, with a loss of 70 percent in 1.5 years, when they were at $115 in the summer of 2014, states that "the company's budgets have narrowed dramatically".
$ 400 Billion
With crude oil prices taking a new leap day by day, it has finally fallen below $30 to its lowest level in 12 years.
"Does oil fall $15?" and "Is oil cheaper than water" are hotly debated in recent days, and research by energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie reveals how falling prices have affected the industry.
In a report he published last July, Wood Mackenzie revealed that oil prices had caused 46 major energy investments worth $200 billion to be suspended, revealing where that figure had reached by the end of 2015.
Accordingly, while 22 major projects were delayed in the last six months of 2015, a total of 68 major projects have been suspended since the start of the oil crash in 2014.
And the value of these projects is about $400 billion.
2.9 million times a day
The study, which highlights the "ineffective" impact of low oil prices on company plans, notes that deep sea development projects were the most affected.
The projects suspended represent a total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent reserves, which means that production of 2.9 million barrels of oil per day by 2025 will be delayed.
According to the study, while the final investment decision of most of the projects in question was postponed to 2017 and beyond, the initial production targets also fell between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 projects that were postponed, the report highlighted potential investments of $170 billion, which are expected to be made over the next five years, "most of the $170 billion are deep-sea projects".
That's because the cost of pre-investment is so high.
"70% of the cost of deep water is primarily due to oil-intensive projects in Nigeria, Angola and the Gulf of Mexico in the United States", it said.
According to the study, the countries with the most deferred oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of their oil reserves deferred.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, which have the largest deposits of deferred gas, together account for 85 percent.
While the vast majority of the natural gas expected to be released here is in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions such as setting up a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant from scratch.
The most vulnerable companies are the oil giants, with their respective commitments in the deep sea, Canadian oil sands and the Bay Area, while the companies are also said to be trying to adapt to the "longer, lower" oil price scenario.
The eyes in Iran
Not so long ago, not four years ago, there was a table: the US and Europe had imposed a embargo on Iranian oil to stop Tehran's nuclear program, the barrel price of oil was about $110, and they were discussing how to cut Iranian oil exports without causing a sudden jump in prices.
And this week, we're going back to a different scenario.
Oil prices have fallen below $30 for the first time since 2004, largely due to the explosion in U.S. production and the rising tariffs on Iran.
That's why his eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, more oil will flow into the oil market, which is already said to be quite satisfied.
This could cause prices to fall below the levels that surprise us today.
Some analysts say Saudi Arabia, which does not want to take market share from Iran, will pump more oil and a price war could be fought between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
As soon as the acquisitions take off, Iran's main target is Asia's fast-growing oil market, its former partners in India and Europe.
Iranian officials earlier said they initially aimed to increase exports by 500,000 barrels a day and eventually put more on the market.
According to Reuters map data, 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCCs) are waiting in the open in Iran, with at least 13 of them fully or heavily filled.
Iran ranks as the world's fourth largest proven oil reserves.
With the exception of the acquisition, Iran still exports about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Before the attacks, Iran's daily oil exports were up to 3 million barrels per day.
Aysun Göksu, a research expert on supportive sources of value, answers the question of whether oil will fall below $20: "China-centred global growth concerns are increasing the downward pressure on commodity prices, causing the loss in oil prices to deepen".
In China, the world's biggest oil importer, we're seeing oil losses reach 20 percent since New Year's Day, with concerns that oil demand will decline in parallel with the economic slowdown.
And, in addition, we could see oil prices fall below $30 in the coming days, with the impact of the global dollar gains and the global supply override.
Unless we see steady price movements above the $32 to $33 levels, the upward movement in oil could be limited and downward pressure could increase.
At this point, it can be said that closing below the critical $30 level plays a key role in keeping the declines going.
In such a case, it should come as no surprise that there are loosening downwards from 23.30 to 25.60 support zones.

- I know.
Not because Europe's economy is great.
But you open some stores for the image.
You'll have a store in fashion capitals like Paris, London, you'll make money from the Middle East.
One brings prestige to the brand, the other brings money, and both are necessary for a brand that plays a global role.
So let's talk about the trends...
- We have a very romantic, elegant season ahead of us.
Flying napkins, soft tones, shades of grey, white, red.
The designs...
We're going through a very difficult and brutal time, and in these difficult times, the fashion world is always trying to bring stylish, interior design to the podium and add a little bit of happiness to life.
That's what we do.
That's why the "race era" is back in the new season.
Let's go back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
Not only is she so beautiful in physics, she's so positive, she's so good.
He would sit next to me when I was working and feed me apples and stuff like, "Honey, are you hungry?"
I mean, she was so sweet.
You know what I'm talking about, and I did some research and you interviewed all the Victoria's Secret models.
How beautiful was Karolina, wasn't she?
But Adriana Lima was so beautiful to me.
- Yeah, that sound!
That speech, that tone...
You're gonna push it back for a while, and you're gonna say, "Sit down and look good, and don't do anything else!"
It makes me nervous.
That's right, shocks are like that.
I was interviewing Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen, but I was terrified of her promiscuity.
- Most of them are now.
New angels are not like the old...
I remember Gisele's time.
It was hard to work with him, though.
He came to the stage, smoking like a cigarette.
It's not like it's a tiryaki.
No one can drink, he can only drink!
The point is to dive.
The Victoria's Secret show, which aired two months ago, received the lowest rating ever.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, the time of the fairy angels is over.
I'm sorry, who's going to do Gigi Hadid?
What's so nice?
Kendall Jenner, like the board.
I'm not curved, nothing.
Kate Moss has zero curves, but she's the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how pretty his face was.
I want to exercise my right of objection here.
I interviewed him last year, and he was pretty upset...
- All that cigarette and booze, now it's ugly.
But in the '90s, she had such a beautiful face.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
She was at the end of her supermodel life.
It was the time of Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was my next door neighbor, and I saw her every morning without makeup.
Such a standing beauty, such a grace, cannot be.
What about Cara Delevingne?
- He's ruining himself.
It's not going to be in every campaign.
People are tired.
There's no hunger for famous models, celebrities, like the old days.
People like themselves, they want to see real faces in campaigns.
We're going to go over this.
Because it's the trend.
Turkish letter from 25 authors
According to BBC Turkish, writers including the presidents of the International Writers' Union (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, said that threats and physical attacks targeting colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life.
The letter also included two attacks targeting the Turkish newspaper Hürriyet, the Koza group raid and the detention of Vice News reporters, as well as investigations and arrests of journalists.
Mother's right to work half-time is up for debate
Turkish-İş "We believe that mothers are given the right to work half-time so that the workforce can be restored".
"This could be a trout horse", TISK said, "we are concerned that this arrangement will be in favor of women and will prevent women from working".
The new rights, which are planned to be given to female employees after birth or adoption, have been passed by the commission through discussions that have lasted all day.
The most frequent issue in the commission discussions was "rent work" for the six months after birth, which allowed for part-time work or free leave, and for the child to work part-time until he reached the age of primary school.
He said that it is right to have part-time work until the child goes to primary school, but that he has some concerns.
Enis Bagdadioğlu, who attended the Commission's meetings on behalf of Turk-Ish, expressed similar concerns, saying: "We have doubts about how to fill the place of female workers in part-time work".
He said that if the hiring work comes back to the agenda, there will be new problems that will multiply the carpentry work, and said, "We will therefore monitor the developments regarding the special employment bureaus with concern".
TISK Secretary General Bülent Pirler said that the law introduced part-time work for 5 years, but "there is no such long-term part-time work in other countries".
And look at it this way.
"Where there are 1 or 2 employees, you have to think about the consequences of this practice", he said.
TOBB consultant Ahmet Shagar also said that if the application comes to life, it will be difficult to find workers.
He said that there is no legislation on the rules for part-time work, and that "the arrangements for the special employment bureaus should be made between the worker and the employer".
Metin Feyzioğlu: We do not support
Feyzioğlu said: "We do not participate in this information, we cannot participate and support it".
Because there's no sentence criticism of the PKK.
You couldn't say a word to the PKK, the divisive terrorist organization, you didn't put dust on it.
We take only and only the heavy statements made against the state seriously and honestly, given the people who have made them.
We are lawyers, we are lawyers.
If there's any illegal behavior by state officials, public officials, security forces in this context, we should follow it.
When we say to the remnants of the Romantic period who sympathize with the dividers or the dividers, "Do not destroy the state", they attack us as "divider, fascist".
When we say, "This state must abide by the law, always uphold the law", they say, "You are dividing".
We are the bridge.
We are people who are always bound to tell the truth.

Who is Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name is Belgin Wrapper, was born in Mersin on July 16, 1960.
After his parents divorced, he settled in Ankara with his mother Sebahat Chakir in 1966.
After resuming Yunus Emre Primary School, he entered the piano department of Ankara State Conservatory, but due to financial difficulties, he left and worked at PTT for a while.
In 1979, after performing at the Feyman Nightclub, where he went to have fun with his friends, he accepted an offer to work.
He performed with the Group Lokomotive Orchestra at the Feyman Night Club with a repertoire of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and contemporary fashions.
Bergen, who went to Adana after Ankara for work, met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982, he released his first longplay, "I Have a Complaint", from Atlas Plak.
Bergen, who could not stand her husband's violence, fled her husband many times as she continued her artistic career.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, she was cheated on by her husband's insistence.
Bergen, who lost one eye and burned most of his body in the attack, was persuaded and put on stage by composer Genghis Özşeker, who made Kibariye famous after treatment.
The artist, who performed at the Izmir Diamond Pavilion, owned by Özşeker until 1985, prepared a demo tape called "Kardeşiz Kader" with his boss and sent it to Yaşar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist who released "İnsan Severse", the first professional longplay in the Istanbul music market, under the musical direction of Burhan Bayar, rose to fame with his "Woman of Ages" towards the end of 1986.
The album was highly acclaimed and was awarded the title of "Best Selling Arabesque Female Artist of 1986" by the record company in April 1987.
In the same year, he appeared in the film "Woman of Ags" with Yalçın Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron.
Bergen, who has a huge fan base, survived a knife attack at the last minute in Adana, where he was going to a concert.
The artist, who also left the stage for a time, released the albums "Onu da Yak Tanrım", "Pread of My Love" and "I Don't Want" under the direction of the great masters Selami Shahin, Özer Shenai and Gengiz Tekin.
Bergen, who was formally divorced from her husband in April 1989, made her return to the stage in June 1989 with her last album, "Years Don't Forgive".
The artist, who began touring to promote the album, was shot dead by his divorced wife in Adana Pozanti on the night that tied 14 August to 15 August 1989.
He was buried in his hometown of Mersin.
Bergen has recorded 129 songs and a video for his 29 years of short life, including five long plays and 11 cassettes.
Claims that the artist who signed the arabesque with a different and powerful voice became legendary were confirmed by the expiration of the album "Giden Jugendmi", which was released after his death.
Bergen's official studio albums:
1982 - I Have a Complaint LP (reprinted as MC in 1986)
1983 - The Sisterhood of the Fate LP (reissued as MC in 1985 and 1990).

Nazım Hikmet was commemorated on his 114th birthday
Nazım Hikmet Ran, known as the National Poet, was commemorated with the "Good that was born Nazım" event in his 114th year of birth.
The event was organized by the Municipality of Konak and took place in the hall where the poet's name was given at the Centre of Fine Arts.
The poetry and music were effectively performed by the famous poet, theater and cinema actor Rusthu Asili.
The three-nation music society also accompanied the event with their comments.
The Nazım Hikmet event was accompanied by many art lovers.
Among these names were Ali Seçkiner Alisi, Erkoç Torun, Nedim Star and Zeynep Göknur Star and Ziya Özsökmen.
In Istanbul, an event organized by the Nazım Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation was held.
The Foundation President Rutkay Aziz and members, daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter of Vera Tulyakova, wife of Nazim Hikmet, actress Tarik Akan, gathered in Tarabya for the event.
"Living as one tree, free as one forest, and as one brother as one brother"
The event will be accompanied by the Nadzim Hikmet Choir.
Nazım Hikmet was born on January 15, 1902.
World famous poet Nazım Hikmet's poems have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He was arrested several times for his political views and spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems have been translated into more than fifty languages and his works have won many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
Bursa Nilüfer Municipality has made special works for the 114th birthday of world famous poet Nazım Hikmet.
The mayor, who worked on the documentary "Bursa's Nazimi", which tells of Nazım's 11 years in Bursa Prison, also issued a personal stamp for the poet for the first time in Turkish history.
Thus, the first personal coin was issued in the history of Turkey in the name of Nazım Hikmet in cooperation with PTT.
The special stamps and first-day envelopes will be presented to guests on Thursday, January 14 at the Nazım Hikmet Kültüride.
They 're going to be deported by bicycle .
But because no deal was reached between the two countries, most of the Syrian refugees will have to pedal back to Russia this time, at least 20 degrees.
In the summer months, because it was safer and cheaper, a group of refugees flew to Russia, from there to the north of the country, from Murmansk to Norway.
The agreement between the two countries did not allow migrants to cross the border on foot, so they crossed by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
So the Norwegian security ordered that the bikes left behind be repaired when they crossed the border.
EU crisis "three billion euros to Turkey"
THE crisis is in Turkey over the 3 billion euros pledged for refugees.
The President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker has criticized Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for blocking the funds to be transferred to Turkey.
Noting that the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe was not good, Juncker pointed out that the EU had to find 3 billion euros.
Juncker said, "This money is not for Turkey, it's for Syrian refugees in Turkey".
We're not even close to 3 billion.
"It's a matter of the credibility of the EU, and that's why it's important", he said.
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by Jan. 26, the date previously given.
Italy is among the countries that draw attention to Turkey's positive attitude.
Diplomatic sources believe that Rome's stance on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey and is linked to problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some EU countries.
There's been tension between Italy and the EU for some time.
Renzi continued to criticize German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU in harsh language at and after the last EU summit on energy, banking and migrants.
Juncker, who criticized Renzi's attitude at a press conference yesterday, said: "Renzi should stop blaming the EU".
"It is wrong for Renzi, whom I love very much, to insult the EU Commission at every opportunity", he said.
Juncker implied that Renzi was playing in public.
One billion of the 3 billion euros promised to Turkey will be received from the EU budget.
The two billion euros will come from the budgets of the member countries.
Germany will contribute at least 427 million euros.
It was decided that the Romanian Administration, which stated that it would not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, would transfer its share of 2.3 million euros to the EU budget for support to Jordan and Lebanon.
The source is expected to be used in 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw the Chalie Hebdo cartoon.
Speaking to the official Russian news agency Sputnik, father Abdullah Kurdi reacted sharply and said, "If you want to be true, I cried for this cartoon".
"I felt very bad", she said.
Father Kurdi, who expressed his expectations of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which became a symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack, said:
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everyone was so upset about this cartoon.
Aylan is a 2-year-old boy and he's dead.
Aylan, me and my family were supposed to be respected by Charlie Hebdo, but it was the opposite.
This magazine should honor the children who died.
They published disrespectful cartoons of our Lord the Prophet.
They even made publications about God.
It's a small thing to do to my child in the eyes of God and the Prophet.
The Kurdish resident of Erbil called for "a call to the whole world and to the humor magazine that all children who die should be respected by all".
They should not grieve their families, nor add pain to their suffering.
Aylan Kurdi's Canadian cousin Tima Kurdi was also among those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau has a defense that the 3-year-old Syrian Kurdish boy, Aylan Kurdi, who shot his dead body on the beach at Bodrum in the signature cartoon, may grow up to be one of the "bullies in Germany".
Last year, the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which was attacked by radical religious extremists and killed 12 people, was again the focus of controversy over its caricature of Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicts pig-faced women chasing women and bullies calling for immigrants, as in the early days of the women's harassment in Cologne, Germany, during the Christmas celebrations.
The cartoon that caused a lot of social media reaction is actually part of a four-square column.
The column reads "France is not this", and many readings criticize the growing anti-refugee sentiment along with other lost values of France.
On the other hand, the cartoon has led many to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Charlie Hebdo magazine praised Germany for accepting 800,000 refugees in a number published last year, while criticizing France's reluctance to open its doors to immigrants.
The cartoon said "It was too close to the goal", and the billboard said "Two kids' menus for one price".
'Authopsy of the Germans who died in Sultanahmet in Germany'
According to the website of the weekly Der Spiegel, the German Federal Prosecutor's Office has ordered the transportation of the bodies of 10 people who died in the attack to Germany.
The bodies of the dead will be received by a German Air Force plane today or tomorrow at the country and airport in a ceremony.
In Germany, experts from the Federal Criminal Court's (BKA) Identity Assessment Commission, which conducts forensic procedures, go to the country where the incident occurred for German citizens who died in an accident or attack under normal circumstances, and do their identification and autopsies there.
But Der Spiegel magazine wrote that this time it would be different.
According to the magazine, authorities from the Federal Criminal Department have asked Turkish authorities to identify the dead and perform an autopsy in Istanbul, but Turkish authorities have not accepted the offer.
The Federal Criminal Department sent four specialists to Istanbul after the attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are being treated in hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has died.
Meiksins Wood, a prominent political theorist and socialist historian, was particularly noted for his important work on the origins of capitalism.
Meiksins Wood, born in New York in 1942, is also published in Turkish: Escape from the Classroom -- The Backward Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- The Roots of Capitalism -- The Capitalist Empire -- The Return to Marx.
Swimming pool ban for refugee men
According to a German press release, the city will lift the ban if the country's social workers report that the message of the ban has been understood by the refugees.
Markus Schnapka, a social welfare worker who told WDR that the mayor did not want to punish the innocent for the actions of several people, said that the residents were informed in three languages about the values that are important in Germany.
Schnapka noted that Germany does not discuss the value of gender equality, adding that the municipality will punish any attack and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility of the harassment scandals in Cologne taking place at the upcoming carnival passes.
The city announced that the carnival crossing was cancelled because there was no guarantee that harassment would not occur.
What are the benefits of steaming?
Steaming, a technique that does not kill the vitamins and minerals in foods, is becoming increasingly popular.
For centuries, steaming has been one of the most popular cooking techniques in the Far East, boosting metabolism and facilitating digestion.
This method eliminates problems such as indigestion and the bacteria and microbes in food are completely killed.
The protein, cellulose, and starch in the food is completely dissolved by this technique, making the food softer.
Low-pressure steam cooking is done in a pot using steam tanks or a steam engine.
High pressure cooking uses less water and less cooking time.
The best example of this is in a pot of brass.
In particular, to cook foods such as vegetables on dietary menus, you must wash them thoroughly and then put them in a filter and wait for them to flow well.
A deep pot is filled with one-third of the water and the steam filter is placed inside the pot.
The mouth of the pot is left half-closed.
This ensures that the steam is released from the pot with ease.
The January heat is first brought to the highest level to boil water, then the furnace heat is brought to a lower level to obtain a steady heat.
Vegetables and foods cooked in steam for about 10 to 15 minutes are controlled with the help of a fork after being thoroughly cooked.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the oven and served on plates.
Steaming is a method of cooking that does not change the appearance, color, or smell of food, so it is healthy.
The taste of your food will stay the same.
This ensures that the quality and taste of the food is not compromised.
It's also one of the most economical cooking methods, steaming, which keeps nutrient loss to a minimum.
Steamed vegetables offer a satisfying feast to those who eat them with a more vibrant and vibrant appearance.
This method is often preferred because it is particularly light in dietary meals.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The "last" album by the alien
Knowing you're going to die, making that last album without telling anyone, turning your deathbed into an artistic expression in the music video you're making...
Things like this might seem too "up" to us secular fans.
I'm saying Earthly fans because I'm one of those people who sincerely believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came to Earth from another corner of the universe, now he's back home, that's all that's going on.
It came because there was an inspiration to be given to all artists around the world, not just Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga.
He did his job well.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price is $9.99 5/5
Probably feeding on Warhol, Kubrick, from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he decided to say, "Is that something I'm an alien?" and he interfered with us by saying "Space Oddity".
He didn't really get involved; he was always a few steps ahead.
Many people have found their lost ways because of him.
The musician and the listener...
And if we ignore his interest in plastic arts, his acting, and all that, it's just not fair to say "it was just music".
His character, who moves from song to song and creates himself, his delivery, his innovation, his taboo-likeness and his discography, represents an artistic integrity to me.
I can't call him the father of glam rock, or the cousin of punk...
What about the avant-garde electronic movements, the jazz he's been hiding in his childhood as love?
David Bowie kept reminding us what the word meant until all those years we'd put the word "icon" in our mouths.
It wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman, it wasn't a "man".
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a mission.
That body left this world two days after the release of his 26th studio album, Blackstar.
He tried to get us used to the "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" we heard before the album came out.
We thought, "He's old, he's talking about death, and he knew everything".
One more game...
The album was released long before, except for the great "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", which contained a message and emotion, but we can say that the number of songs we know was four, along with "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", "Tis A Pity She Was A Whore", which was re-recorded for this album when the album was released.
The rest of them, "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away", and "Dollar Days", are really good songs.
Overall, it's built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's made with such a sincere, instantaneous feeling, like "Blackstar"...
Not death, not a "contract of the past" album...
It's just a real "last" album.
The End is a masterpiece of a musical life.
Turkey targeted in Sultanahmet attack
Holger Münch, head of the German Federal Security Service, made a statement on a program on German broadcaster ARD about the attack on Sultanahmet Square on Tuesday that killed 10 German citizens.
Münch said the target of the attack was Turkey, not German citizens.
"400 people in my life"
But Münch said the Sultanahmet attack did not change the threat of terrorism in Germany, saying, "We are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously".
Munich noted that the number of people who went to Syria from Germany to join ISIS was declining, and that many people had returned from war zones.
Explaining that this is a major challenge for security forces, Münch said, "There are almost 400 dangerous people we should not be monitoring right now".
He called for improved coordination and closer communication between police agencies in Munich.
Turkish authorities said the live bomb that carried out the Sultanahmet attack was a Syrian citizen and member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the identity of the attacker had not yet been identified.
Sezen Aksu is saying goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who celebrated his 40th anniversary with a concert series, charmed his fans with his "Years of the Season" concert at the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The first part of the concert series, which was held in July, was held at the Volkswagen Arena from 15 to 16 January.
Aksu took all his audience on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
Besides the love songs that touched our personal lives, Aksu sang songs about social issues that are of close concern to our country and our world.
Aksu, who said he would be leaving the stage after performing the concerts he promised, saddened his fans.
At the "Seasoned Years" concert, Sezen Aksu came out to fans filling the Volkswagen Arena with a different story in each piece.
Each story, show, light and stage show took viewers to different eras.
In the final part of the unforgettable concert, a video was shown showing the Istanbul paintings of the Revolution Erbil.
Aksu also hosted the first time on stage, with the pre-recorded videos of his fans.
In Ankara and Istanbul, bread increased by 25 cents
In Ankara, 250 grams of bread were sold for 25 cents, starting from 1 TL.
On the eve of the new year, especially in December, the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Faruk Çelik, and the Minister of Customs and Trade, Bülent Tüfenkci, made statements saying "No time".
But in Ankara, 250 grams of bread were sold yesterday for 1 TL.
As for the 25 cent increase in the price of bread, the President of the Turkish Bakers' Federation Halil İbrahim Balcı said, "No time has been set, the tariff decision was implemented 2 years ago", adding:
"That was a prescription decision taken two years ago".
The Chamber of Crafts Association set this recipe two years ago.
A price that applies throughout Turkey.
So a new bid was made and no price increases.
But because of the competition, in some parts of Ankara, the craft was selling for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already sold for 1 TL.
The craft that relied on their desk, their bread, didn't lower the price.
No increase or boost.
They're applying a non-existent price.
"If the price of a kilogram of bread in the first half of 2016 will certainly not exceed 5 TL and we will finish the year with this price if we do not experience a great deal of trouble".
In some parts of Istanbul, bread has also started to be sold for 1.25 TL.
This time, the terror has drained Burkina Faso.
In the West African country of Burkina Faso, 23 people from 18 different countries were killed in an attack targeting a luxury hotel that was popular with foreigners and United Nations officials.
The North African arm of al Qaeda took over the attack.
The attack in Burkina Faso came four days after ISIS carried out a terrorist attack in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, the world's most populous Muslim country with a population of 250 million.
A Canadian and an Indonesian died in a bombing and gun attack on a busy street with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops, and a police station in the middle of the day.
Indonesian authorities have said the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre of November 13.
British BBC security reporter Frank Garner also noted that this action was part of a frightening trend that has recently manifested itself in many cities around the world.
The United States was also hurt shortly before the terrorist attacks.
In early December, 14 people were killed in a gun attack by an ISIS sympathizer couple in San Bernardino, California, USA.
The San Bernardino attack that shook the United States
After the live bombing in Sultanahmet, where 10 German tourists died, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere recalled that there were terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, saying, "We have seen two major attacks in Paris".
If we say that, then terror will win...
We used the phrase "not to step back".
ISIS has left WhatsApp and is talking to Alrawi
According to a new report, the terrorist organization is using its own chat tool to communicate independently of chat apps such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to Defense One, the organization is using a new messaging app to communicate with each other.
This Android app called "Alrawi" is distributed and downloaded through an APK file.
The app allows the organization to encrypt messages and media sharing between themselves.
Flash forward from ISIS in Iraq
The functionality of the app remains "primitive" compared to popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
It's not clear how powerful the encryption is.
ISIS previously carried out all communications via Telegram, which allows messages to be sent via encrypted connection.
But Telegram revealed the channels where ISIS members spoke.
And the U.S. government is demanding that app developers put backdoors in their apps.
So the organization is now using its own solutions instead of relying on the encryption of WhatsApp and Telegram.
UAE: Iran is a nuclear-armed country
Speaking at a press conference in Vienna, Kerry said Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear deal and that the United States had officially lifted economic sanctions against Iran: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear deal.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted that he congratulated the country on lifting sanctions following the nuclear deal signed between six countries and Tehran.
Fenerbahce is the champion of the veterans!
The 4 Grands Hall Tournament, where legendary footballers from Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray and Trabzonspor compete against each other in league format, ended with the final match played last night.
Fenerbahçe won the match 8-6 at the Sakarya Sports Hall.
Fenerbahce, which started the match quickly, closed the first half 5-1 with an effective game by Marco Aurelio.
Galatasaray, who put a tremendous pressure on the first few minutes of the second round, scored back-to-back goals to take the score to 5-5.
However, Fenerbahçe managed to overcome the shock, scoring two more goals and winning the match 8-6.
In Fenerbahçe, legends such as Elvir Balich, Mehmet Aurelio, and Jayhun Erish were wearing their uniforms, while in Galatasaray, legends such as Ayhan Akman, Umit Karan, Papen Mustafa, Hasan Shaash sweated.
How should the semester break be assessed?
We asked the question of how students should evaluate their half-year leave to Murat Aydın, an education specialist and student coach.
The semester should not be thought of as just a student holiday, a time for relaxation, fun, and watching television and computers.
The half-year break is a great opportunity to prepare for a new era of education and to revisit the past.
The half-year holiday, called vacation time, is also an important opportunity for personal development, knowledge, skills, and hobbies.
Make a list of the semi-reviews.
Write down everything you're going to do, plan it, and try to implement it.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and have a very productive semester.
Now let's talk about how a productive semester should be for fellow students who are primarily preparing for YGS-LYS.
Because the questions that come to us most often from our friends who are preparing for the YGS-LYS are, "How should we evaluate this time, should we solve a lot of questions or should we solve the missing issues?"
To answer these questions and to have a productive period, let's first introduce our writing to the friends who are preparing for the exam.
While the exam preparation process should be a process that starts in the ninth grade under normal circumstances, we are more likely to try to complete it within the last year, which forces us to spend the last year more effectively, efficiently and accurately.
The senior student must also conduct school writing together in addition to exam preparation.
Even if the graduate student has taken and experienced at least one exam (YGS-LYS), the year in which he or she will prepare for the exam again as a graduate student is also critical for him or her.
Because most graduate students and their families see the O as their last chance, and that creates even greater stress.
Studying is the study that the student does because he doesn't enjoy it, because he feels compelled, and so usually always stops, but for the students who do it regularly, who make it a habit, it's become a complete task, and it's always part of a plan when and what to do.
Now we have a half-year vacation ahead of us, and we should make the best of it.
And for that, we must have a plan to manage our time well.
Lesson Study in the half-year vacation:
Each must first make a plan according to his situation.
What was done, what was missing, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, what was done, and what was done, and what was done, and what was done, and what was done, and what was done, and what was done.
During this time, there must be both repetition and question-solving.
And students who are not too short can take an average of one or two tests.
You've got your missing points solved: Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetting is to repeat it.
Students who make too many mistakes in the past should focus on general repetition.
First, identify your missing topics and plan for them day by day, post them every day, and make sure you get them covered.
This planning will make you academically and psychologically comfortable.
Make sure that when you plan your topics, you make the most mistakes.
Because in the future, you won't have such a long vacation.
Answer the question:
It's just as important to solve a question as it is to repeat the subject.
Because we can only see how much we understand what we're doing by the conclusions we get from the questions we solve.
Remember to set a certain number of questions to be answered each day.
The number of questions you're going to answer may vary depending on the work you're going to do that day, and you may not be able to answer many questions in a day of intensive work, but at least we need to do some sort of question-solving work to see how much we've learned about the topic that day.
Resolve the test:
Another job you'll do on your half-year leave is to solve the test.
Even if you're not done with all the subjects, at least you can do the lesson test.
Let's say you've done a lot of Turkish lessons, you can solve 40 quizzes.
And make sure you work on time while you do that.
If you can solve 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes at first, then your next goal is to be able to solve them in a few minutes.
Holiday and Hobby Plans:
A vacation is not just a matter of studying; you should also take a few days off for vacation, rest, and hobbies.
A period of vacation spent just studying will prevent you from being discharged and resting.
So, you should have special moments in your plans to set aside for yourself.
Reading, watching TV, surfing the Internet may be part of your plans, but more importantly, how much time you'll spend on it.
I'll give a little advice to friends who say I didn't make it through my first term.
If you're saying my first term didn't go very well, I didn't work hard, and my shortcomings were too much, this semester is a great opportunity for you.
But first you have to decide and believe.
In the 2009-2010 season, the most goals were scored between 76 and 90 minutes.
Now, answer your question, is the game over and you're going to the dressing room, or is the game still going on and you have a lot of minutes to score?
I don't think anyone wants to say, "We'll watch the next game", which is a classic commentary by a losing football coach or his players.
Now all you have to do is leave the past behind and look ahead, not walk, but run.
Well , to sum it up ,
1) First, plan a half-year vacation,
2) Go over the topics you know and do it again,
3) You've got your missing items,
4) Solve the problem and reinforce the issue.
5) Solve the test tests,
6) Read the book,
7) Set new goals for the new term,
8) Take time for yourself, your hobbies, and the things you enjoy,
9) Spend time with family and friends
10) Spend time on social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theatre, concerts, trips, picnics, etc.)
The caravan has come a long way.
Karvan's founder, Shinasy Demirel, and his son Hasan, who founded one of Turkey's largest home store chains with an average of 45 stores of 1,000 square meters each, added Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad and 25 in-house.
With the recent completion of commercial record operations, the caravan has also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Shinashi Demirel, who said there is no store in the country, said: "We will continue with the big store with the caravan, the smaller store with Home Sweet Home".
"The caravan will also be launched abroad", he said.
The merger of Home Sweet Home with Caravan, which had a turnover of £50 million in 2015, resulted in a retail chain with a turnover of £140 million.
With 45 stores in 35 states, the total sales area of the company is 45,000 square meters.
25 stores are owned by the parent company.
I have about 500 people on the trailer.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores in 25 countries and has a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and 320 employees.
Chairman of the Board of Directors of Home Sweet Home, which produces, exports and shops with partner Alev Pakten, Kadir Kalayjioglu, said that they are very pleased to merge with Kervan, saying, "We are from the Mardiennes and entered this sector in 1998".
We've been a brand since the beginning with the backing of the Shinasi gentlemen.
Mr. Shinasi is the TRT of this sector.
We learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step in the grocery business when he gave us his own White Center store.
The caravan and I were already working as strategic partners, not rivals.
"Now this merger will create a very serious synergy".
Kalaycıoğlu said that Home Sweet Home currently has 17 stores abroad, including in the Middle East, and they also started exporting to China last month.
Kalaycıoğlu: "We also opened our first corner in Shanghai".
We've got a deal with a chain of 200 stores.
"From now on, we will develop the big shopping caravan abroad, the small shopping with Home Sweet Home", he said.
Poroshenko sells his factory in Russia
Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, CEO of Roshen, who interviewed Liga.net about the matter, said the factory was put up for sale for $200 million.
Moskalevsky said, "Yes, we put the factory up for sale".
"As soon as it went on sale, all the real buyers disappeared", he said.
"We have set the price of the company's plant in Lipetsk, Russia, at about $200 million", Moskalevsky said.
Roshen, which produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and candy a year, is one of the world's largest producers and is owned by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Star Holding is out of the country
Star Holding has merged global companies operating in the biscuit and chocolate sectors it purchases under the name "Pladis".
With the merger of De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ulker, a new $5.2 billion food giant employing 26,000 people has been born.
Speaking at the meeting on the merger of global companies within Star Holding, Star Holding's Chairman Murat Ulker said, "Being a global company has been our goal from the beginning", adding:
Murat Ulker broadcast live from Periscope the sale of 335 million lira
Founded 72 years ago, this company is now a global brand in the chocolate chip cookie business under the name Star Holding.
In that time, we have grown from making chocolate cookies to retail packaging, to real estate, personal care, and various industries.
We have 77 factories in 14 countries, 300 brands and thousands of points of sale.
Saying that All Star Holding is "a family of over 50,000 people", Ulker said, "Now that we look at the possibilities in our family, we want to go back to making chocolate biscuits, which is our main business, and we want to be global in this area, and we're reorganizing for that", and he explained the new design:
The life story of Ulker's father Sabri Bey
We're reevaluating our corporate structure, reorganizing ourselves.
We've divided the world into regions.
And we've allocated these areas to our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütüncü is responsible for the Turkish Middle East, South Africa and the Turkish Republic.
Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for our global Godiva business as well as the American continent and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be in charge of the UK, Continental Europe and Africa.
Ali Ulker, the quality and innovation guru, will take global responsibility in his field, while Jam Karakaš will help me manage the business.
China, Russia, and part of Southeast Asia will be the regions we're going to build and develop.
Murat Ulker sold shares in SAF GYO
"We promise happiness to the whole world with every bite", said Murat Ulker, "Our global company we founded to achieve this is called Pladis".
"Where did you invent the plastic, that name doesn't really have a specific meaning", he said, adding:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
The Japanese are Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, Surya, we are inspired by the name of the Pleiades team star, which is made up of seven stars in Latin, meaning country.
So we translated the fateful Ulker into global.
Ali Ulker, Vice President of the Board of Directors of Star Holding, also stressed that by cooperating with laboratories in different countries, "we have begun to create synergy in innovation", adding:
We have very valuable R&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G&amp;G
We have 27 research centers under Pladis.
The largest of these are in Turkey and England.
We have over 300 R&D experts working here.
And their synergy work is already beginning to work.
The Drages (Nibbles) of Digestives, which is produced in Ulker and will begin exporting to the UK, is being produced in Ulker's chocolate factory in Silivri.
Another example of synergy: the country crispy chicken, which is different but the same product.
We quickly adapted a cracker technology developed in England, Jacob's Crinklys, to Turkey, and brought it to our country under the name of the delicious country crispy turkey.
Laviva, who we all know very well, met with consumers in America today.
Call of Duty has surpassed 250 million
The series, which Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games have carved into the game world in gold letters, looks like it will be remembered for years to come.
Especially the newly announced sales figures are pretty much proof of how legendary we should find ourselves.
Activision, which owns the series' licensing rights, had 250 million copies sold in its exclusive distribution by the end of the year.
And earlier last year, the company, which shared the sales of the entire series, has since sold 75 million Call of Duty games.
And we're not so wrong if we say that a large part of that number is definitely Black Ops 3.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu once again elected President
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected as the general president of the General Assembly.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who won 990 of the 238 delegates who voted, became the president again.
248 of the votes cast were invalid.
After the result was announced, the party members were in a show of joy.
The CHP had a total of 1,275 delegates.
The board completed its work to meet at 10:00 on Sunday.
Kılıçdaroglu summed up the meeting:
We'd like to have games here, singing turkeys.
But the point is not so clear.
There's an uncontrollable Turkey.
The atmosphere that's created is shadowing all of this.
The reason for the blackboard is the people who rule the country.
As CHPs, we are against terrorism, no matter where it comes from, no matter how it comes from.
Terrorism is a crime against humanity and terrorists should never be forgiven.
Terrorism is fought with reason, with knowledge, with inspiration.
Of course we fight, we don't want anyone bleeding from their nose.
What's different from the photos in Syria, the photos in Lebanon, the photos in the Southeast?
They made serious mistakes while sitting at the table.
The power is responsible for the blood flowing, the tears, the deaths.
In 2002, they took over the country with zero terror, and today there is a Turkey that is turning into a lake of blood.
Who's responsible for all this?
Is this the taxi driver from Diyarbakir?
What is Turkey paying for?
We will attend meetings and express our thoughts on the change of the strike laws.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone's personal opinions.
I say, "Let's change the spirit of the coup".
The intellectuals of this country are being pressed into their homes in the morning for their public opinion.
There are aspects we disagree with, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator's son-in-law says, "Eat the bread of the state and be hostile to the state".
I want to ask him why people who eat the bread of the state and take advantage of all the state's facilities, do not think about robbing the state?
The CHP is the party that has brought the greatest change to this country.
We will all be preparing for the Fourth Great Revolution.
At any cost, we will bring freedom-loving democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can arrest us, whatever they do, no matter how much it costs, CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I call upon thee openly, Son of David.
Hiding behind the coup law, the man hiding behind the coup mindset.
You awarded the distinguished service medal to the man who honored you.
What strike are you talking about?
We're back to fooling the people.
Party officials listed the other three revolutions as follows: the end of the Great Revolutionary dynasty and the establishment of the Republic; the transition from a one-party period to a more party-like period during the Second Great Revolutionary Revolution; the transition to social democracy with the third revolution Bulent Ecevit.
The president has qualifications, duties.
Article 103 has the president's oath.
We know how important the concept of decency and honor is in this society.
If a man goes out and makes a promise, he keeps it to his death.
Because honor and honor are indisputable to us.
What does the man with the dictator's nakedness mean to you, honor and honor?
What do you understand about honor and honor, why did you swear this oath?
What do you mean by honor and honor?
I want to know that.
The noblest of all things is the dignity of the pious.
Their intention is not to abolish the law of coup, but to rule the law of coup.
They don't want the presidential system.
How about a president, a boss-led presidency system?
Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?
Anyone who orders will do what they have to do.
Is the parliamentary system working in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring in libertarian democracy, the system works.
They call it a coup, but they've strengthened the coup law.
Mustafa Balbay, the deputy of Izmir, who announced his candidacy for the presidency, could not participate in the contest because he could not gather the signatures of the 128 delegates needed for the candidacy.
The Colonel, who has amassed 92 signatures, said, "I can't run under the current circumstances".
He noted that while the parliamentarians in the parliamentary hall have seats reserved for members of the party parliament (PM), central executive board (MYK) and honorary council, former CHP leader Deniz Baykal sat in the stands with the party members.
Gulay Yedekçi, deputy of Istanbul, instead of sitting in the seat reserved for the deputies, came early and sat next to the seat reserved for General President Kılıçdaroğlu.
The meeting with the Yalova MP Muharrem Ince, Kılıçdaroğlu, was one of the topics discussed at the council meeting.
Ince explained that he did not accept the offer of PM membership.
However, the general central sources claimed that the interview request came from Ince and that PM membership was not recommended.
Ince tweeted: "Anyone can learn from the general sources, the content of the conversation, Istanbul MP Ali Özcan".
Uzcan said, "How can I know about two people meeting?"
He just said "I met him last time".
Kılıçdaroğlu often applauded the press.
On the first day of the "Ordinary Council for Democracy, Change and Brotherhood", the party parliament (PM) has sealed its seal.
Kılıçdaroğlu went home after the council speech and started working for the PM list.
While preparing the key list of 100 people, it was learned that the current MYK members, who did not want to be in the management, said that they would call 13 MYK members other than Seyhan Erdoğdu, who once again ran for PM, and Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, who did not apply to the PM.
It is noted that Kılıçdaroğlu may also point to another narrowed list of PM keys for 100 people.
The 21 articles of the Results Communication, adopted unanimously by the CHP Board, called for the removal of the clauses on the European Local Government Agreement, which had been the subject of the DTK's autonomy discussions, and for increased power sharing on the ground.
The bill also included the goals of "ending the party state system", "establishing a free and accountable rule of law".
The council was followed by Deputy General President Selcuk Özdag of AK Party, Idris Baluken of HDP, Ruhsar Demirel of MHP.
AK Party member Özdag and AK Party delegation left the hall after Kılıçdaroğlu harshly criticized President Erdoğan.
Uzdag said, "I saw that the criticism was going to go over the dosage, I couldn't accept it".
The banners in Kurdish, Turkish and English "Barish" and "If you don't burn, how do you get darkness into light" with photographs of arrested journalists Jan Dündar and Erdem Gül were displayed in the hall.
The council started with the group commentary and the song of Ahmet Kaya in the morning.
The message sent to the council by the Turkish Ambassador, wife of the Diyarbakir Bar Chairman Tahir Elçi, who lost his life in the armed attack, received a big applause.
Berkin Elvan's mother Gulsum and father Sami Elvan also attended the board.
Kılıçdaroğlu said that the need for democracy would be "dead" if it had to be paid.
CHP has already assembled 52 councils, including 34 ordinary, 18 extraordinary, and held its 53rd grand assembly yesterday at Ankara Arena.
The attendance was high.
There were over 15,000 CHP in the 12,000-seat hall.
But there was no enthusiasm for the crowd.
The most exciting moment was when Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued as the Kılıçdaroğlu couple greeted the hall.
There was no evidence of the discipline seen in the AK Party boardroom.
Even when Kılıçdaroğlu spoke, there was a lot of movement in the field area of the Arena.
Apparently, the CHP candidates who wanted to join the Party Congress preferred to seek support by telling party leaders and journalists about themselves.
A CHP executive tried to explain that this was not a bad thing, saying that "party figures like party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union are better off sitting up like a rope".
There's another difference between the CHP board and the AK Party or the MHP board.
Only the presidents speak at these parties.
In the CHP, the council becomes a platform for discussion of party issues.
When the number of parties who wanted to speak at the council yesterday was too high, the Chief Justice Murat Karayalç had trouble setting the time.
There was a distance between faces and tongues, and comments like "The country is going badly", and "You're going to change course with this painting coming out of this room".
All the CHP people said, "Something has to be done", but there was no consistent, robust answer to the question "What should be done?"
The effect of this was that no election would be held in the next four years.
When Kılıçdaroğlu took the stage, we journalists were waiting for his answer to the question "What should be done?"
Kılıçdaroğlu first answered the question "What is happening?"
He pointed to the issue of journalists, the actions taken against academics because of the report, what happened in the Southeast, the foreign policy entrance.
He gave a long, long answer to "Anatolian legends" about the CHP, such as "it is a non-religious party", "supports coups", "the party of elitists".
When it came to the "what to do" stage, he tried to put the "strategy" out instead of concrete steps.
He stressed that all these problems can be overcome with a stronger democracy and more justice.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "Until we bring democracy, we will work at any cost".
"We will fight for democracy to the death".
One last note, I also need to remind you that the CHP has solved the problem of "organization" by the 53rd Congress, and can now assemble a smooth assembly.
By the way, there were cards printed for 900 journalists who were supposed to follow the board, but the press participation in the hall was not that high.
Representatives of Ankara media organizations were not as willing to follow the council as the AK Party councils.
The self-government is asked for a permanent
The indictment of 7 defendants, 3 of whom were arrested, was accepted by the Diyarbakir Prosecutor General's Office.
The indictment stated that on the instructions and calls of senior leaders of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization, statements were made under the name "ozyadmin" in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbakir, Istanbul, Shırnak, Mardin, Muş, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağrı.
The indictment, which alleged that the organization's leaders and youth and women organizations were calling for illegal actions, noted that Diyarbakir's surrender of long-range weapons and rocket attacks on security forces, public institutions and organizations, homes, workplaces and vehicles of citizens in Sur, Bağlar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro counties increased.
ISIS and the opposition clashed, our headquarters was shot
The recent clashes between the Islamic State and the Conquest Army, which was formed by the Islamic State and opposition groups in the village of Duden, Black Mezra Bigheddin, Syria, opposite the Yavuzlu village of Kilis, continue to intensify.
Turkey also heard gunfire and air strikes during the clashes between IS and opposition forces near the border.
While smoke rising from frequent explosions was visible to the naked eye by Turkey, security forces at the border line took heavy action with armored vehicles.
On the other hand, the Islamic State militants have opened fire on the border station of the Shahid Mehmet near the village of Yavuzlu in Kilis from the village of Bigheddin.
Under the rules of engagement, the soldiers responded with shells and heavy weapons to the area where the assault fire was opened.
Russian warplanes reportedly attacked the village of Hameyn, 17 kilometers from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians injured in the airstrike were taken to the Church State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
The lottery rich got their checks.
The Robinson couple, who live in a small house in Munford, Tennessee, worth $150,000, chose to take a single payment of $328 million over a 29-year period, instead of receiving a total of $528.8 million (1.6 billion TL).
The couple said, "We have no guarantee of tomorrow after all".
John Robinson, who works in a chain of stores, and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant to a dermatologist, said they'd be on Monday even though they're now millionaires.
The couple's primary goal is to pay off their home loan debt and help their loved ones with the money they earn.
It was announced that the grand prize was divided into three.

FedEx's revenue is mixed, and its financial performance will drop in 2016.
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant has cut its forecast for the full year due to declining demand for cargo services and rising costs in land services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Pre-opening operations fell by about 2.5 percent 45 minutes before the opening gong on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 based on research by FactSet.
The average increase of 4.9% to be effective on January 4 and the land transportation of heavy or large packages is likely to decline despite high overloads starting in November.
The company says that cost cuts, higher revenue and profits from e-commerce growth are still expected to be higher than last year.
Fred Smith, chairman and CEO, said the company "performed consistently despite the weak economic conditions expected, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
Vacation plans were announced a day after rival UPS, which said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, the same number as last year.
For the three months ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 below the estimates of 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx suffered a downturn in international priority transportation last year, which caused revenue to stagnate in the Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has elevated the results of FedEx Land Services.
In the last quarter, land services revenue increased 29%, but operating revenue was essentially stalled due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
The express unit saw a high return due to its high base rates, while the cargo business declined due to its high labor costs.
In pre-opening trades about an hour before the opening gong, FedEx shares fell $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday with a drop of 11% for the year and 17% below the record level of June 11.
In their most anticipated meetings in years, Federal Reserve politicians decided that the time had not come to raise interest rates again for almost a decade, spending two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran maun table.
The two-story meeting room on one wing of the central bank will be the United States' mural.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has two tasks from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices here stable.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have acknowledged a third unwritten proxy: financial equilibrium.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in an unpredictable decision on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to begin cutting off its unique stimulus support from the near-zero short-term interest rate that has been around since late 2008.
While most data shows that the economy is growing steadily, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may already make careful Fed officials reluctant to add vulnerability by raising the reference federal funds rate - even at a rate of less than a quarter of a percent.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they're watching", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they're looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer", he said.
There's no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, and that in itself leads to fluctuations in the financial markets.
Half of the economists Bloomberg recently interviewed were expecting an interest rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to hold out with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of growth.
This could signal a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, and policymakers promise another increase is on the way, but they don't mitigate the impact.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to 16,599.85 with a 228.89 point increase, or 1.4 percent.
John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group, said: "The increase was triggered by the expectation that Fed policymakers would keep the rate steady this week".
"It would be amazing if the Fed raised rates right now", he said.
If the Fed had made a decision, "they would have had to wait a long year to calm down the financial markets so they wouldn't panic".
Other experts suggested that a rate hike could calm financial markets due to the rise of a foggy curtain on when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to raise the rate by 0.25 points this month, a small step toward a gradual tightening of monetary conditions that would strengthen the recovery of the United States.
Yellen said he expected this year's rate increase in spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals about the need for a more economic process.
Although the rate of job creation declined in August, the growth in the labor market has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to its lowest level in seven years, 5.1 percent, and it's approaching the level the Fed has been counting as full employment.
The pay increases showed signs of improvement.
And while the central bank's inflation rate continues to be below its annual target of 2 percent, Fed policy makers say the temporary impact of sharp oil prices is a major factor.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy "can handle higher rates and needs them despite the tight labor market".
But financial markets around the world began to shake up after China's currency devalued late last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below its record level of 16 percent in May, due to investors' fears that a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has somewhat receded, when the Dow is now below its high of almost 10% in May.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil makes it even more complicated to calculate when interest rates will rise.
Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the Ziman Center for Real Estate at UCLA and former Fed official, said, "The last few weeks have been a bit of a stretch in this meeting, with the unknownness of the financial markets in the Chinese economy and the lack of news about economic weakness".
Now he predicts they'll wait at least another month to better manage these effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be, and they have almost no data to count on forcing developments in China forward", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not a Fed's priority concern, so technically it shouldn't be a factor in the blackmail process.
But the Fed has actually become the world's monetary authority.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
Until then, the only clue from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed could "reduce" the monetary expansion triggered by global market shocks.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere but also consult other central bank executives and experts to better study the global economy.
Zachary Karabell, global strategist at asset management firm Envestnet Inc., said the decision-making process is "more of a skill than a science".
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Vice President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that "the Fed has overreacted in the past to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee who lobbied for rate increases, cited 1998-99 resolutions as an example.
Lacker said that "despite limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth", the Asian financial crisis caused the Fed to cut its index rate by 0.75% over three meetings.
A year later, the Fed officials took back those cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee of the Bank of England, said: "The Fed should only put financial balance concerns first during major crises, as it did during the 2008 market meltdown".
He said the last storm wasn't even close to that.
You really don't want to be left in a situation where you're afraid of going up a rate because the markets are so rough, said Peterson Posen, president of the International Economic Institute.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and does not mention financial equilibrium, and I don't think they should do anything about it until that changes.
You want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinatown.
The market/depot opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Know.
The LAX-C wholesaler market, often referred to as Thai Costco, is also a wholesale market in Thailand.
Yeah, that's Chinatown, not Taiwan.
The market/depot is a one-stop shop; it sells a large number of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asian and Thai snacks, kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
You want to buy motor oil, you even have the auto parts.
The store is huge and it can take an hour to walk all the hallways.
If you're hungry in all this shopping, grab some food from the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The inside of the store is next to the safe, and there are various options for taking out.
What's in stock: Do you want something Thai?
It's probably in LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes special Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits and more.
The meat shelf is very extensive, and so is the fish -- the workers behind the counter clean the fish and make the filet, even fry it if you want.
There's a large freezer in a large part of the store where you can find frozen cranberry leaves, bitter cabbage and galangels, all duck, fish, calf's blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial food, and more.
Who's shopping: restaurant owners and chefs, families and individuals.
There are both shopping carts and forklifts in the wide corridors.
Fresh monthong durian right next to the exit stand.
Where: The store is in the industrial district of Los Angeles, between Chinatown and Downtown, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
LAX-C has its own parking lot, shared with other shops and restaurants.
The store is very busy, but it's not usually hard to find a parking space.
The Brazilian Pediatric Society of Rio Grande encourages healthy nutrition during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS used a shocking method to test and explain the importance of healthy nutrition to women in breastfeeding processes by including images of unhealthy foods with images of a lactating infant.
Human milk is made up of many types of protein, fat, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide all the nutrients needed to develop a healthy immune system for babies.
Because of their excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories.
However, recent research suggests that the dietary supplements mothers should take are not limited to calorie intake.
A new study led by professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas suggests that pregnant women's healthy diets have been influencing their babies' genetic expression to protect them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy eating has been shown to negatively affect a child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to dominate the ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on the Today Show
The moves by Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to overthrow the leadership of the Liberal Party in Canberra failed to bring about a rating increase for Today.
After Tony Abbott's fall of Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was staged in the nation's capital.
Hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage in London, Rival Sunrise has been caught between weekly international series including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
As the distance issue doesn't make much difference to Australian viewers, Today has an average of 397,000 Sunrise viewers in five capitals, compared to 339,000.
Today posted a slight increase in ratings on Monday (317.000) compared to Tuesday (283.000), but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343.000).
Today has been closing in on Sunrise for the past few months.
Today's average was 318,000 against Sunrise's 330,000 figures in August.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, the Sunrise average is 349,000, compared to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change are affecting more of the population this morning than the parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the breathtaking start of the 800-word saga by Erik Thomson, star of the old Packed to the Rafters.
The new drama about a newly widowed father and his two children moving to the coast of New Zealand has reached a very impressive average of 1.219 million.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could have run a solo show without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The end of last night was a resounding yes.
Seven's X Factor maintained its strength with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating the Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Love has mixed his night fortunes with two tracks- Australia.
The first half hour of the new information contest hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17:00-17:30) averaged 446,000 viewers.
In the second half (17:30-18:00), the number jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
The first half-hour of Monday Night Track-Australia reached an average of 520,000 viewers, rising to 720,000 in the second half hour.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
The second-night drop in Australia's ratings made Nine think the Hot Seat would prevail at 5:30.
The follow-up Australia was a live-action remake of McGuire's show, the Million Dollar Minute.

The last three think that single Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly figured out who would win the bachelor party.
The woman Sam Wood was going to pick at the end of his bachelor program was kept a secret.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell us who the last rose field is.
But the day before the three men fell in two, Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski, they may have given a clue without knowing who the winner would be.
Sam Wood has his mouth sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women spoke lyrically about why Wood was so great, why they wanted to be his partner, emphasizing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude.
But their answers to the question, "If it's not you, who's gonna get Wood's last rose?" may contain information about who's gonna win The Bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been pretty close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows said, "From the moment I got home, I read about the energy of (Sarah) and Sam's energy and I felt they were compatible, and I thought about it throughout the program".
Markoski added: "Sarah is very practical, and it's fun to be around her".
I saw them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable playing side by side.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna be a very good couple.
Mackay said last week's home visiting appointments made her think Wood was the "right person".
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was definitely not just a game - I was totally dependent on him now", she said.
When asked who Wood would choose if he wasn't, it was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that", he said.
"I love the other girls equally - Snezana and Lana equally".
The Bachelor is on the Ten at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday.
First broadcast: is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne has had a variety of options as to where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle got a lot of attention for him after he moved to the States, and after his impressive open practice day last year, a lot of other teams came to him.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and that seems like a very wise decision.
Some coaches have placed Hayne in reserve for his loss in Australian rugby league performance, as in Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed this guy and gave Hayne another chance to play in a game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued to show her true color to the dressing room after the game.
Instead of humiliating the squad in front of the whole team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-match press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the drop and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne led the Minnesota Vikings to a score in the first quarter and knocked the ball out.
This wasn't what Hayne and his vast Australian fan base had imagined for their first NFL game.
Hayne was seen off the field after dropping the ball and later told Australian radio host Hamish and Andy that he couldn't think of a worse start to his NFL career on 2DayFM 104.1.
He said, "That was just one of those things, you're gonna be sad about the next game, and that's it".
Hayne also recalled his first match for Origin in 2007 with a score-breaking back pass to Queensland.
Still, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a post on Instagram after the game with fans holding an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested for armed robbery at a crossing in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was imprisoned, the oil company was seized by Yukos, and pro-democracy efforts were cut short.
Four people killed in Nepal as police stuck plastic bullets on protesters
On Wednesday, an official reported that police fired plastic bullets at a crowd protesting the proposed new constitution in the country, killing four people, including a 4-year-old boy.
The incident took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
District chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 phase protesters gathered outside a police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper spray before using plastic bullets.
He said 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It's not clear why plastic bullets used for killing are such a high-fatal shot, as they are a known but generally less lethal alternative.
The conflict was the latest in weeks of violent protests across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group have argued that the newly proposed constitution would allow the regions to monitor their own political influence.
The ethnic group Tharus, which wants to establish their own state, is also protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since August 10.
At that time, four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions - an important but unrest-ridden creative step in the preparation of a new constitution in centuries-old central government Nepal.
Work on a new constitution had been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands.
Lawmakers worked on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new text would be drafted by Sunday.
The NHC says there's a 60 percent chance of a hurricane in the southern Cape Verde Islands.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday that a large low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent likely to become a tropical storm within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecast center said there was a 60 percent chance of a tropical storm over the next two days.
Google has launched a donation matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that have helped thousands of refugees flee their war-torn and impoverished countries to Europe.
Google announced the donation initiative on its blog with an unexpectedly personal approach.
Instead of a director making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote her own personal experience.
"In addition to hunger, thirst, cold, and fear, we had many dark bus and train journeys", he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe grows, many families, like my family, need help.
The donations will go to four nonprofit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Rescue Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the first $5.5 million donation to google.com/refugeerelief until it raised $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely due to the four-year civil war in Syria that displaced more than four million people this year.
He's also fleeing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which have been hit hard by many wars.

Weight loss surgery may help diabetics who are moderately obese
According to a new study, it may take at least five years for obese patients with type 2 diabetes to see the benefits of obesity surgery.
But it's too early to tell whether moderately obese diabetics can live longer after obese surgery than patients who have not had surgery.
Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote a paper on the new JAMA surgery, and an expert on obesity surgery, says that "the mortality rate takes a long time to manifest itself".
Weight loss surgeries, otherwise known as bariatric surgery, use a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
These reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on highly obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, measured by weight-to-weight ratio, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI of 25 or above indicates a person is overweight, and those with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate BMI from this link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, the fully-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data from an experiment comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and tube-stomach surgeries - used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes with moderate obesity since 2007.
Since the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those who had surgery has dropped from 31 to 24.5.
To do this, the non-surgical diabetes treatment subjects had a stable BMI of around 29.
Diabetes is partially resolved in 36% of those who have had surgery and in 28% of those who have had surgery.
In the medical treatment group, diabetes was resolved in only 1% of cases, and only in 2% of cases.
The authors also noted that blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "intervention group".
The researchers also imaged blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflected the blood sugar levels of patients over time.
The researchers write that it's best to keep the A1c hemoglobin below 7%.
After surgery, the A1c hemoglobin dropped from an average of 9 percent to about 6 percent.
The group receiving treatment remained stable at about 8 percent.
But with improved hemoglobin levels of A1c, this better glycemic control, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his team, has not reduced mortality in the past five years.
The research team compared the findings to those two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (5.1 to 7.4) and similarly A1c hemoglobin (2.1 to 3.1%) decreased more than the group with tube-stomach surgery, and their overall risk of diabetes decreased more (16.7 to 46.9%).
Although the research did not reveal a clear benefit to survival after surgery at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of the Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix said that there were valid data that surgery extended life expectancy in a study of obese patients in Sweden.
In this Swedish study, obese patients who had bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years than other groups who had more traditional treatment.
Although this new study did not reveal the surgical survival benefits, Blackstone said that for people with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 35, this is a confidence boost.
And this is the most devastating part of the article, because it says that in the low BMI group, this surgery is safe, there's no increase in risk of death or kidney disease, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking weight loss seriously as a patient's BMI drops below 27 to 30.
I think we waited long enough for people to take this seriously.
I think it's really hard to reverse this after you've collected these genetic changes in your body that have linked your body to obesity and diabetes.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama, who said Europe could not accommodate all refugees, added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
At the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain, the Dalai Lama spoke about the ongoing refugee crisis at the opening of the Dalai Lama compassion center in Oxford, where he will be working on ethics.
He argued that under the present circumstances, the interests of humanity should come first over the interests of countries or continents.
He also stressed that, while appreciated, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was insufficient in this regard.
He said in his speech, "It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe".
Although he appreciated the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, the Dalai Lama stated that these were only temporary solutions.
"It's great to be concerned with a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you have to think about how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries, basically through education", he stressed.
We need to think about how we can reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never been the solution to problems".
In his address to the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also mentioned George Bush's actions after the 9/11 attacks, saying that the US' violent response has started a chain of uncontrollable events.
In a letter to President Bush after 9/11, I expressed my health wishes and stated that the solution to this problem was nonviolent.
I know their intentions were well-meaning, but they used force and caused unexpected results", the Dalai Lama said.
Childhood intake of hand antiseptics has quadrupled in the last four years
The Centers for Disease Control in the United States reported an increase of nearly 400 percent in high-alcohol wet towel intakes seen in children under 12 since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of reported cases of hand antiseptic swallowing in children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are becoming more and more attracted to these kinds of products", Lopez told CNN, "and unfortunately, there are those in the percentage that need to be moved".
He said that some children deliberately drank hand sanitizers, while others did so to impress their friends or in a social media claim.
YouTube videos show teenagers taking antiseptics for cheap booze.
Some teenagers have reportedly mixed the antiseptic mixture with alcohol-containing mouthwash to produce a harder bowel.
Young children may be attracted to the smell of antiseptic agents.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think it's a bad thing".
The most attractive ones are the ones that smell.
There are hand sanitizers with strawberries, grapes and orange flavor that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers, wherever you look, contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few sprays of alcohol can cause poisoning.
According to Dr. Stephen Thornton, president of the University of Kansas Hospital Center for Toxicology, who gave it to Fox 4 in Kansas City, "high concentrations of alcohol".
You don't leave a few glasses of whiskey around, but people leave these hand sanitizers in the middle, and that's an easy way for kids to get a fair amount of alcohol.
Recently, six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who swallowed strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer only four times at her school, was rushed to hospital for treatment.
His blood alcohol content was 0.179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated him at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, which was twice the legal alcohol limit for an adult.
Nhaijah couldn't pronounce the words and couldn't walk when he got to the emergency room.
Rithey reports that the doctors kept the little girl under observation overnight in a separate children's hospital despite any signs of brain trauma, as alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN that she was "very scary".
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to keep antiseptic pads short of contact with the skin and to take them where children cannot reach them.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a hand sanitizer containing an unnamed toxic substance.
Health officials had suggested that the substance may be methyl alcohol, not ethyl alcohol, as indicated in the list of contents, but lethal.
In January, three fourth-graders from upstate New York plotted to poison "bad-hearted" teachers, according to police reports, by "planting antibacterial products around the classroom".
The teacher was highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from being used in class.
The police described the plan as a "failed attempt" and recommended disciplinary action against the school administration.
You too come to Samandera
Robin van Persie, who was watching Fenerbahce's THY Europa League match against Lokomotiv Kuban, finally reunited with Udoh, Vesely and Melih at the end of the meeting.
Van Persie, who had a warm conversation with his fan Udoh, said, "I came to watch you".
You and your friends are going to watch me practice.
"I'm waiting for you at Samandera".
Kahpe fele is innocent
I was so humane today.
I want no deaths.
But what's the point?
This world is cruel.
Flex coffee.
There is death in destiny.
It hurts.
And the alien invasion.
And the lightning strike.
A space shuttle that sometimes hits.
Maybe it was a meteor.
I'm not saying death.
I'm saying, let's get our signatures off.
Let's put our reaction.
Say, "Woe to you, O king of the earth!
Our humanity is great.
Shame on the poor.
But he's not ashamed of it!
Two weeks ago, Miray Ince was killed in the Sur Quarter of Shrinak.
She was only three months old.
And his grandfather was there.
They killed him too.
What can we say, you cowardly bastard!
I think he was running from the aliens.
They scanned him while he was looking for a safe place.
He had his wife with him.
A day later, Angel Alpaydin was killed at the breakfast table in Little Aktarli Street in Diyarbakir.
Two days later, the Sema Chinglyoglu Elementary School was burned down by aliens.
Two days ago, the same aliens attacked another school full of students with firearms.
The students have been running away from each other.
On January 10, the bodies of three men killed by the Kafefefefe fighters were left in the Mosque of Hazreti Huseyin in the neighborhood of the Martyr Aaron Boy.
Two days ago, three children lost their lives in Chinnar district of Diyarbakir.
An unidentified object killed these little ones with a ton of explosives.
There were other dead and wounded.
Who's the culprit?
The flock, of course.
- I'm not going to.
No, it's not the party with the coffee.
The coward is innocent!
The killer's out there, shaking his arm and looking at our faces and smiling.
Some people try to draw attention away.
When the killer is in front of us, instead of pointing the finger at the killer, he creates opportunities for him to escape.
The killer is getting dizzy.
He's hiding it.
Even after he disappeared, he tells the person who comes to him that he's not really guilty.
The sides of the fight we've been through for the last 10 years are very clear.
Someone wants to narrow the circle of fire around us and burn us.
Someone's trying to stop it, and even to put out the fire around us.
He's in the business of tearing down, robbing.
Someone's after you, to produce.
We have people who have been fighting every kind of war in our region.
It's the civil war.
The war between states.
The war of the sects.
The war of the proxy.
And they have stones.
The dirty terrorist organizations.
They're bloodthirsty clowns.
In different names, in different formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight each of these.
He fights, and therefore must face the evil of all.
Keep fighting until you're sure of your evil...
The traitors were not spared, they took refuge in white linen.
PKK members, trapped in a corner of the neighborhood, find the solution by mixing white flags and fleeing between the citizen.
Security forces are using GBT to prevent the leak.
The peace and democracy operations that began on July 23 are also breaking down the pro-democracy force of the organization, which has been making a massive coup in the countryside and beyond the border.
According to sources in the region, the weapons and ammunition depot of the group that had suffered a major coup in Silopi was seized and rendered ineffective.
Some civilians fleeing the attacks of the PKK, holding white flags, are fleeing the police and soldiers' controlled conflict areas.
Terrorists who were stuck in the streets and could not find a way out, began to flee with white flags, mixing with civilians.
Security forces are conducting a General Information Collection (GBT) investigation into suspects.

In other counties, it was stated that security in areas where joint teams are clearing terrorists will be left to the commanders.
One ton of police and soldiers' stash
The Church Municipality sent 1 tonne of garbage to special operations police and soldiers stationed in difficult conditions in Gizre, Sur and Silopi.
Mayor Hasan Kara, who condemned the terror, said, "May my Lord give strength and strength to our security forces who are protecting their country and their people by serving under difficult conditions".
"We ask for mercy from God for our martyrs, and for the healing of our needy".

Saudi Arabia has not given up on TIBITAK
Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Fikri Işık noted that a new agreement was made for the second-party sale of the Balistic Image Analysis and Recognition System (BALISTICA) to Saudi Arabia, developed by the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Institute (TÜBİTAK), and said that "with the agreement covering the development and installation of the additional 8 systems, the number of BALISTICS to serve in Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14".
Light made statements regarding BALISTICA, developed by the TÜBİTAK Space Technologies Research Institute.
Light said that the system allows for comparison of ballistic examinations of the weapons, bullet cores and shells captured in the events with data in the central database, so that the problems that ballistics experts encountered when examining the shells and shells were eliminated.
The light, data from different geographical locations and accompanying information, can be questioned by being hidden together thanks to BALISTICA.
Noting that one of the most important features of BALISTICKA is its ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data that provides more detail and less error, Light emphasized that the innovations brought by the system allow decisions to be made quickly by the ballistics specialist and increase its success to a great extent.
BALISTICA was exported under the "SUBA-1 Project"
Highlighting that BALISTICA meets all the criteria for success and received a full rating from the General Directorate of Security, Işık noted that the system established in 10 different regions, including Ankara, covers all of Turkey.
He also recalled that BALISTICA was exported as part of the "SUBA-1 Project" with Saudi Arabia and that its installation was successfully completed in 6 regions in 2013.
The Minister noted that a new agreement was signed for the second-party sale of BALISTICA to Saudi Arabia, and that the SUBA-2 was signed, which is the continuation of SUBA-1, and said that the number of BALISTICA to serve in Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement, which includes the development and installation of an additional 8 systems.
A crocodile fossil the size of a bus has been found.
The prehistoric sea crocodile is reported to have been 10 meters long and weighs 3 tons.
The crocodile's skull was measured at just over a foot long.
The researchers named the species "Machimosaurus rex" and published their findings in the journal Cretaceous Research.
Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna, who is the lead author of the paper, noted that the 130-million-year-old fossil "is about the size of a bus".
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said that the giant saltwater crocodile "was at the top of the food chain in at least one region at that time".
Paleontologists have explained that the M. rex, believed to be the largest crocodile in the sea, is ambushed in the lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is believed to have been the "Sarcosuchus Emperor", who lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago, and could reach 12 meters in height and 8 tons in weight.
They're all so confused!
The first book by author Ece Temelkuran, 'All Women's Head Is Confused', was adapted into a theatre of the same name by Aysa Production Theatre.
The play, which stars Deniz Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, İpek Türktan Kaynak, Kadir Çermik and Şebnem Sönmez, is directed by Selen Uçer.
The play, which still features the play 'Poz' and 'Dry tight', questions the confusion in women's minds, with Ucher having first-hand experience writing and directing.
The play met with the audience at the Trump Show Center last week.
The play begins with radio theater.
In the dark, a voice that takes us back to the past...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing by the window, about to jump down.
Who he was and why he tried to commit suicide, can be seen from the intervention of his neighbors.
One school is blocked
'Ebru Uysal', which is animated by Deniz Çakır, is a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
It's got stuff that's been in it since he was a kid.
His lack of fatherly love, his exclusion from his student life, his lonely childhood, his mismatches, his misunderstanding, brought him to this point.
He decided to kill himself, leaving a letter behind, but he can't jump out the window.
Because the mysterious woman 'Perran' (Shebnem Sönmez) who sits in the apartment opposite the cleaner 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde), the gossip of the apartment next door, is haunting her.
They're approaching it like it's a normal, normal process.
She's getting more and more depressed and can't concentrate and jump.
The conversation between the three turns to a turbulent one when the famous singer who cleaned her house joined in 'Meltem Kaya' (Ipek Türktan Kaynak).
Approaching the situation in a naïve and intimate way, 'Meltem' is not able to stop singing when she sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt takes on a different dimension when the real estate agent 'Murat (Kadir Chermik) enters the girl's house with a spare key.
The fact that the singer Meltem is giving the press false information is making things worse.
The game also uses the song "Street Girl" by Nazan Prior.
I 'm not a big fan of this .
Ucher, who directed for the first time, managed to provide the pace and fluency of the game.
The comedy load of the game is drawn from Silk Turk with Zeynep Kankonde.
The cartoon type that the duo animates, both with their mimics and their lines, makes the audience laugh.
While Szenmez's experience of years is very well transmitted on stage, Deniz Çakır also shows a convincing performance in reflecting the depressed mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Çermik, who mentioned his name for his performance in Tolga Çelik's award-winning film 'Sarmaşık', successfully accompanies these four women.
The one-screen play, described as a tragic comedy, promises to laugh without getting mixed up.
I often remember those beautiful words from the mouth of 'Perran' played by Shebnem Sönmez:
All the kids have thought about dying at least once to punish their parents and for some reason they've always cried.
She's hanging in the air like a joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important place.
In fact, every story begins with some sort of abandonment.
I have to put my hands in my pocket sometimes, I can't stand things without a pocket.
People wonder where to put their hands.
We're surprised to see more hands.
People talk about what they don't understand, they make it up, they make it up.
A misunderstanding is real.
All women's heads are confused because they are confused.
You can't die, so you have a chance to live.
'Eat the infidelity and live long'
Can be safely consumed at any age
Speaking about the health benefits, dietitian Pinar Quaral Enç, who says that the miracle nutrient kefir, which is a staple ingredient in milk but is more beneficial than milk, is one of the nutrients that can be safely consumed at any age, said: "It is more nutritious than yogurt because it contains protein, essential minerals and B vitamins".
It's also rich in vitamins B1, B12 and K.
Thanks to its calcium and magnesium content, it forms the basis of a healthy nervous system.
It's also a good source of phosphorus.
Kefir, which also has the ability to hold down, also doesn't lose weight.
He said, "The weight of the fish is very high, and it will make my digestion easy".
♪ Every time I get into trouble ♪
"Kefir is a local drink made mainly in the Caucasus", said expert dietitian Pinar Kural Enç, who said children, the elderly, pregnant women and women who are in menopause can consume kefir without hesitation.
But now he's starting to tell the world his name.
Kefir, the secret of youth, the potion of a long and healthy life, is the camel to almost every trouble.
And one of the most natural ways to keep babies away from metabolic diseases is kephar.
The friend of the gut
This unique drink, which has no end in sight, is a friend of the gut.
We have 1.5 to 2 kilograms of bacteria and fungi in our intestines.
The microorganisms in the digestive system are also divided into two groups, useful and harmful.
Beneficial microorganisms are called probiotic microorganisms.
Probiotics have as much effect as our liver, and when consumed enough, they prevent harmful microorganisms from sticking to and spreading to the intestinal wall.
A breakdown in the balance of healthy microorganisms in the gut causes many diseases.
The digestive tract must be maintained with proper nutrition.
And we should definitely consume enough probiotics for that.
It removes these problems in the gut.
Kefir is the most effective probiotic nutrient, and the beneficial bacteria in it have a huge effect on strengthening the gut system.
It helps the beneficial bacteria and fungi in the gut to reproduce and be healthy.
Regular use of kefir works the gut, eliminates intestinal disorders, reduces swelling, and promotes healthier digestion.
A healthy gut system means a healthy, disease-free body.
"Kefir, which is also good for conditions such as insomnia, insomnia, upper respiratory infections and allergies, also helps babies get more quality vitamins and minerals from food, so it also plays an important role in baby nutrition", he said.
He wants to pick up where he left off.

Mario Gomez, Luiz Rhodolfo and Andreas Beck, who have three yellow cards in the Super League, will not be able to wear a uniform in the match against Trabzonspor in the deplasm in week 19 if they see a yellow card against Mersin Idmanur.
The goat of Beşiktaş, Gomez

Letters from little students that are moving
The Western children sent letters to the police and soldiers conducting terrorist operations in the district of Sur, the central district of Diyarbakir, for moral reasons.
It was originally the 75th.
The school started its work in coordination with the students of Istanbul West Ataşehir Natural Science High School and Eskişehir Ataçag Middle School, including the Republic Primary School.
As a result of these studies, students in schools printed the choreography on the chocolate, which they made into a moon star, and then wrote nearly a thousand letters, poems and drawings.
The children then sent their work to the Diyarbakir Security Directorate.
The Diyarbakir Security Directorate has set up an exhibition table on the work of children in the West.
The exhibition, which was set up in the new Security Directorate building, featured the work of students.
The exhibition was visited primarily by police officers and civilians who served in the Security Directorate building.
The letters and pictures, which contained meaningful writings and poems, moved readers.
A student wrote a letter about the operations in the central district of Sur, saying, "Our beloved police officers thank you for your sacrifices to protect innocent people in Diyarbakir".
It's been reported that the exhibition will last until next week.
He named his daughter Angela Merkel.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, who has been criticized for her refugee policies, was given the name of a refugee baby.
Memun El Hamza, 26, who managed to reach Duisburg, Germany, fleeing the war in Syria, and his wife Tema El Havar, 21, named their first child "Angela Merkel".
Tema El Havar, speaking to the German press, said: "We are grateful to be here.
To show that, we named our daughter Angela Merkel".
Father Memun El Hamza said, "Germany has become a mother to us".
This is the second "merckel"
It's been learned that baby Angela Merkel was born on December 27.
According to German press reports, the tiny Angela Merkel, who weighs 3,300 grams and is 55 centimeters tall, is in good health.
And last year, a Ghanaian refugee named his daughter Angela Merkel, and some refugees opened up "Mother Merkel" banners in support of Merkel.
Consumer confidence in the US at its seven-month peak
According to university data, UMICH's stove was up 0.7 points to 93.3 points from the end of December.
As a result, the market expectation for the index, which has been at its highest level since June 2015, was set at 92.9.
Richard Curtin, director of Consumer Research at Michigan, said in a written statement: "Consumer confidence has moved up to the fourth month as expectations for future economic growth improve".
"In general, the expectations for individual financing have maintained their highest level since 2007 due to weak inflation".
The statement also included the prediction that consumer optimism will now depend on inflation remaining exceptionally low.
UMICH, which posted its best annual performance since 2004 at an average of 92.9 last year, is determined by the results of a survey of at least 500 people each month.
The results of the Super Lotto

Putin is spitting
While Russia is preparing to recognize the status of "can do business with Russia" for Turkish companies if Turkey cannot provide services otherwise, the Russian Association of Tour Operators has made a statement that "Russian citizens do not renounce Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which estimated that the severance of existing economic ties with Turkey would bring additional costs to Russia, prepared and published a new draft "Exceptional situations" for the Russian government regarding Turkey.
According to the draft published in the Russian Federal Register, Turkish companies and companies will be allowed to do business with Russia even if they enter the sanctions area if necessary.
According to the draft, Turkish companies and companies can benefit from their products and services in cases where it is impossible to obtain them from sources other than Turkey or where domestic production in Russia will bring serious additional costs.
The mixed commission, which will be established in cooperation with other relevant ministries within the Russian Ministry of Economic Development, will determine which Turkish-origin goods and services will be included in this category.
So that Turkish companies can be selected by bureaucrats to decide which companies to work with Russia.
The same document also says that Russian government agencies and private companies will have to prove to the commission that their work with Turkish partners is not legitimate.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government and comes into force, a record of privileged Turkish companies will be created in Russia.
The Russian Association of Tour Operators also said in a statement that Russian citizens did not give up on Turkey.
The statement said: "Despite the ban on tour sales and the Russian Foreign Ministry's advice not to go to Turkey, our citizens began looking for a formula to organize their holidays on their own".
The number of posts on social networks entitled 'The most practical and cheapest way to spend a holiday in Turkey' is growing.
The most common suggestion is to book a hotel online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the drop in oil prices to below $30 as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
"It was a terrible surprise for our government, just as no one had ever imagined that oil would fall by $30.
It seems that with this approach, it will not be possible to implement the budget as it is today".
The last month of 2015 we left behind.
After the crash of the plane, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that economic sanctions would be deepened.
In those days, our businessmen trying to get to Russia in the usual way, our THY staff are officially struggling at the border gate.
Turkish goods are being smuggled into customs and subjected to unthinkable controls.
Not long after, a month has passed and Nerdun Hajioglu from Moscow reports yesterday.
One way or another, the sanctions are softening.
But why?
The reason is simple.
In an era of economic globalization, the way you closed the border with the methods of a century ago is no longer to be used to turn political conflicts into economic wars.
Look, we're still writing about Iran and how the economic embargo that's been in place for years has been torn down.
Two neighboring countries, like Russia and Turkey, which seem to have many friends but are not really friends, actually need each other.
It's technically impossible to tear these two countries apart in one night, with businessmen, tourists, entrepreneurs, customers.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other's country through the door.
It's best to have the political debate at the table before the abductions create new Reza Zarrab's.
Without ever messing with the economy...
Hotel attack in Burkina Faso: 20 dead
At least 20 people were reportedly killed in a car bomb attack on the Splendid Hotel in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou.
Burkina Faso Interior Ministry officials said security forces found 20 bodies in the lobby of the hotel and in the cafe of the hotel.

Bad news from Sur: 1 martyr
Police officer Ali Bulduk, who was seriously injured by the bombing of a handmade explosive device set up by terrorists in Sur district on the 46th day of the street ban, was taken to the Diyarbakir Military Hospital and died without being rescued despite all the interventions.
It's been reported that the city is registered with the Adana population.
The Diyarbakir did not support the terrorist act!
According to the information, at 17.00 pm, a protest against the operations was planned in front of AZC Plaza on the Ekinciler Street in the office district of Diyarbakir Yenişehir district.
No one participated at the required level in the public outreach, which was called for by brochures and invitations.
While thousands of people have attended previously organized events, recent events have attracted attention because of the lack of public support.
The group, which failed to secure a majority in front of AZC Plaza, disbanded before taking action because it did not receive support from Diyarbakir citizens.
Terrorists burned schools in Diyarbakir
According to the information, the incident occurred in the Yunus Emre neighborhood of 1007th Street, Central Bağlar County.
A group of masked terrorists entered the Nuri Zekiye High School at around 7:30 p.m. after setting fire to the building, throwing molotofcocteils.
Citizens in the vicinity reported the fire to the fire department after the building caught fire.
The fire department called the police and asked for security measures to allow them to enter the area.
A large number of police teams were then sent to the area in armored vehicles.
Upon taking security, firefighters who came to the school extinguished the fire without encircling the entire building.
As police teams searched the scene, a multi-pronged effort was launched to catch the escaped terrorists.
On the other hand, some police officers at the scene helped the reporters to take pictures, while one police officer tried to block reporters who wanted to take pictures.
ATM thieves took over the bank
Police teams attached to the Izmir Security started work on the complaint that some people were being used to extract money from their accounts by copying their bank card information.
Police identified the perpetrators as M.M.G. (43) and R.O. (32) and determined that the suspects copied the citizens' card information using "card copying mechanism" and "mini camera" placed in ATMs in different provinces of Turkey.
Suspects who learned the card's passwords were found to be dealing with these cards.
The operation has resulted in the arrest of the suspects.
The teams that examined the knee-high computer used by the M.M.G. and R.O. seized numerous videos of the mini-camera system used to capture passwords of citizens who transacted at ATMs, and determined that the suspects stayed briefly in the counties they went to to avoid capture.
It was also revealed that the suspects made an unfair profit of 50,000 liras by copying at 15 different ATMs in Izmir.
The suspects were arrested after their security clearance.
Authorities warned citizens to regularly check account movements against such incidents and to use their hands to screen ATMs during password entry.
Netherlands: Assad to be tried in the Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said that Syrian President Bashar Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Court (UCM) in The Hague.
Speaking at a conference he attended in The Hague, Koenders said Assad was responsible for the refugee influx.
Koenders, who pointed out that peace in Syria will not be possible as long as Assad is in power, noted:
Assad needs to be tried at UCM in The Hague.
A man with so much blood on his hands should be held accountable.
Assad is also solely responsible for the refugee influx we are currently facing.
However, I know that Assad will not be leaving his post any time soon.
This is a matter that needs to be discussed first, and Russia needs help in this regard.
Whispering protest against Burak Yılmaz
The protest whistle rose when Burak Yılmaz failed to reach the pass goal he wanted to give Sneijder in the 59th minute of the match against Medicana Sivasspor.
So Burak Yılmaz reacted to the hand gesture of the whistle-blowers.
Then the reaction grew and whistles of protest were heard every time the ball came to the goalkeeper's feet.
Then some tribunes supported Burak Yılmaz and protested the fans who made senseless reactions to their own players.
Then a large section of the tribunes supported Burak Yılmaz.
Rumor accident: There is no inconsistency at Celtic
Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad place and he'll get over it, but Griffith doesn't care about the inconsistency at Celtic.
The struggle of hearts, the SFA's punishment of Neilson and Warburton's timidity in the face of the January signings that disrupted the team's unity
The Don's have narrowed the score to five against Celtic.
Adam Rooney's penalty kick in the first half brought Aberdeen a legitimate win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, giving the Don's a chance to make a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about the words of inconsistency.
Griffith pushes back the rumors of inconsistency at Celtic, saying that he and his teammates were not under any pressure as they prepared to face the Dutch League Leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I'm convinced the players are eager to do so.
The lack of a Scottish title race is annoying for Dutchman de Boer.
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international footballer Ronald de Boer says Dutch football enthusiasts have lost interest in Celtic as they have no more competition with Rangers.
De Boer, who is already an Ajax ambassador, said: "They don't give Celtic game summaries in the Netherlands anymore, why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about my old team.
They talk to each other when they're talking about teams, they're concerned about it.
The old team's matches were tense and not only Scots wanted to watch those matches.
I swear to God, Deila, I'll make things right
Ronnie Deila admitted Celtic were struggling but the Norwegian boss said the move would be reversed.
The defeat against Malmö and then the Champions League draw followed the losing match against 10 man Aberdeen, who are now in the lead with a five-point margin in the points table.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad times in the past, and we'll go back again".
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know it's very disappointing and I know a lot of people are angry or sad about what's going on.
We're in the same situation - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes these players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's shyness in January transfers
Despite comments he made just two weeks ago that he set some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton has withdrawn from the contract, insisting that Ibrox does not want to disrupt the team.
"The January transfer window is very different from the summer window", said the former Brentford teacher.
For summer players, there's a pre-season period where you get them used to, which we saw this season in our own group.
The team's really good.
Sometimes it's more harmful to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic is targeting Michu on retirement.
Michu signed for Celtic from Swansea on a transfer window, and has ruled out his plans to retire when his contract with the Cougars expires.
At the age of 29, he suffered for two years from an intolerable ankle problem and couldn't find a way out of Wales in the summer.
Hearts are preparing for SFA fight on Neilson's comments
When Paterson was kicked out of the game, the Hearts led 2-1 and then lost 3-2, reversing everything after the defensive player's red card-- Collum's third red card to be canceled in eight months.
Neilson insists, "I never questioned the union, I never commented on the performance".
Griffiths tried to avoid Tynecastle.
The obsessed Hibee was scolded for singing a song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel that contained offensive lyrics.
It took place in March 2014 in Tynecastle, in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh Derby.
"It was a derby match and it was hot at the time", said the attacker, adding: "I can definitely say that I will not go to Tynecastle any more than to play Celtic.
Tannadice board has confidence in the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly still believes that the Dundee United management team will make things right - but they accept that the downturn on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the kids ready to go again", Donnely said.
Mclness is pleased with the "ugly win" against Hamilton
Derek Mclness admits that Aberdeen's first-half penalty kick by Adam Rooney forced them to hold on desperately to Hamilton Accies to see Celtic's seventh consecutive win over the top five in the league.
Mclnnes said: "There is no team in the middle of the world that wins anything without winning a match in this way, whether cups or leagues".
Unemployment rates in England are rising, but rates among Scots are the same.
IN Scotland, employment remained constant between May and July, with the number of unemployed across England rising to 10,000 to 1.82 million.
According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 percent, higher than the 5.5 percent in the UK.
On the other hand, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, leaving the current employment figure at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent - above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Minister of State David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's been almost a full year since the historic day when Scotland decided to remain part of England.
In these 12 months we have seen improvements in the Scottish labour market with the increase in employment and the decrease in unemployment.
Why I'm a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the hours ahead of today, I'm going to watch a man murdered because of a late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'll be sitting in the death room lounge at the Oklahoma State Prison, watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He wanted me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made through her best friend in January, and I accepted, as shocked as I was.
As that day drew nearer, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
It'll give you a different perspective.
It's true, journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there's more practice than there is, there's a terrible lottery when deciding who to elect.
Oklahoma dropped the media seats from 12 to 5.
Whoever gets elected will watch without being touched by those feelings.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a relationship with him through phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit over the past few months.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities said that I would not be able to witness or be a journalist, so I would not be given a pen and a book to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes it, get access.
I complained to him.
She admitted that she "could have put it better", but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip, I disagree with you about some of the things I say and write.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't accept it if he did.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime he wanted.
But he wants an international reporter there to write it.
If he dies, he thinks that spreading it to the public will help the movement against the death penalty.
I'll have a reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, with me.
If you want to know more about this, please listen to the podcast series I've been working on.
I'm not going to go into all the details here.
I have no idea for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
What Barry Van Treese did after he died is enough to make him an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murder.
I believe there is absolutely no evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm going to watch his death from that perspective.
I can't really pretend to be objective.
You can check with other reporters there for that.
The impression you'll get from me will be the impression you'll get from watching a man you like die unnecessarily.
After a series of police chases, the man was convinced of the Canning River.
Canning Vale police officer was driven out of the Canning River convincing the man.
A Perth man's claim to escape from the police car behind him ended in a shallow muddy water where a police officer "could gently persuade him to return to shore".
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday over an unauthorised break-in.
When they saw the suspect, the man tried to escape the police by entering the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"Lt. Shandell Castledine, standing in the water, said, 'I'm not going out, come get me.'
Police officer Lachlan Perhavec refused to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Senior Deputy Commissioner Castledine said, "Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape".
Champion football player Ben Cousins is a lasting example in our minds.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to escape a police liquor check and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
Their efforts failed, but it inspired the local people to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon for the sake of humor.
Peter Moody claimed the bookies had cheated on him and threatened him to quit the race.
Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria's coaches tried to set up a setup in their own barn last year and threatened him to leave the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted the cahoots and the union department, and said they had launched a personal campaign against her to exclude Lady Tatai from the race at the final meal for the race on the pre-race Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in the race, and told Lidari that when the job came back positive on the cover, he found himself in a power situation that he couldn't explain.
He said he had been biting his tongue for 18 months for alleged espionage and did not want to "look like a happy grape".
"I wasn't going to say that, and I've been covering it up for a long time, but sometimes you get so angry and everything happens all at once", Moody said.
They know this is going on.
Sometimes you react and you suffer the consequences of what you say, and I will suffer the consequences of what I say.
I'll sleep comfortably when I get home tonight.
I want to walk upside down and let my bosses know I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start to think I didn't do it, I shouldn't be a manager anymore.
I'd be wondering what I'd do with my license if I were.
Earlier, Moody had detonated a bomb in a racing.com interview accusing the union department of being involved in espionage in his barn.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I'd call it if you ask me - and in return for telling them what I was doing in my barn, they offered him a job in my barn", Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they're gonna have to return their pants because they weren't good enough to catch me.
Former RVL president Robert Roulston, new RVL president David Moodie and the current CEO of RVL knew that then and now.
Does that make me think it's getting personal?
RVL has a bunch of balls, and maybe it wants to hold someone other than the operators responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my license and kick me out, but I have no doubt what I'm saying will make them think.
But I'm not getting anything when I get here, and that makes me sad.
It really bothers me.
I'm going to put pressure on them, make them decide.
I have the support of my family and I'm going to walk.
The disillusionment of the operator over the long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari and the subsequent scratch made him say "throw my license on the opposite end of the table".
Moody, who is famous for preparing the undefeated Black Hawk, called the race day care rule "ridiculous", saying that it was against the rules to roll mud or clay sheet to the horse's feet.
This is against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this".
One of my men accidentally pushed mud on her foot.
He could have taken it last night.
He could have bought it yesterday, which he did.
It took the day of the race.
Moody could face up to three months' probation for using a racing day sticker as a result of an investigation by the board.
This is a joke.
Those who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We know we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
Hit and run driver arrested in Cobram
Police arrested a man who hit a bicycle and ran away over the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital on Saturday morning after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway due to serious injuries.
Police said the hit-and-run driver escaped the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old Nathalia man turned himself in to the police station in Shepparton.
He's expected to be charged with failing to stop, failing to assist, and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still stable in hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has responded harshly to his rivals' claims about wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described his team-targeting criticism as an attempt to "create a day" for the NRL's two favourite premierships.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said Friday night in the semi-final in Sydney that the referee allowed Storm to "fight" his team in a match that was a shock.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett gave Storm a very uncapped pass after the team's semi-final win against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling it a "legendary" game for rugby league, saying the two Oueenslands were not "too big" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's struggle and said that when they were fighting they focused only on "touch".
Bellamy said he was encouraged by the criticism of the two top hockey teams because it meant they were worried Storm would beat them.
It's happening - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year, just that we've made a real emphasis on our combat contacts in the last six weeks, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he obviously has a great team he's coaching, and he's probably not used to losing in a little shock to himself.
It's funny that this happened this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of "inspirational football", recalling Bennett's coach who won the 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared our game on Friday night to his own game on Saturday night and how exciting their game was".
I remember back in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give a rat's ass.
But now they have a team that can play what we might call exciting football, and especially their young half-backs with their speed.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have these types of players.
He made that point in 2010, and now everybody wants to play football that way -- every team doesn't have half-backs like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it's not possible to play that way.
It gives me more confidence because even they're a little shy about playing.
I guess they didn't think of us six weeks ago when they went to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos were probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game is 20-18, our game is more than both sides score, but is that exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut off attacks but not score-scoring attacks?
This is my day.
If they're talking about us, that means we'll meet them here at a later stage.
Storm won't be hosting the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks this weekend because they won the right to host the first final game at AAMI Park on Saturday night, which is on sale Tuesday.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail for drug charges
The man who was caught smuggling 40 kilograms of cocaine into Queensland and faced a possible life sentence has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five people caught last month by federal police tracking 100 kg of drugs coming from South America via Vanuatu and from the Solay yacht that was brought to the port at Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his accomplices in the marina this morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilograms of drugs inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a potential life sentence for possession of commercial cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all the drugs and that he could be in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was at risk of escape.
He's got open connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he was in a public case.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather offered him $200,000 to bail out.
"After reading the affidavits of both men, it is clear that the $200,000 bail amount is a real financial burden on them", said Judge Flanagan.
But he warned that it was not enough to keep him from going to trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for handing over both Australian and Serbian passports, and complying with the daily police ban on going to the station and going out between 6pm and 6am.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phones to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was asleep, logged on to an online messaging service, and provided her with a series of inappropriate childish visuals sent to her by another user.
She woke up later and realized she didn't have her phone, and she found it in the hands of sleeping Hogg.
She looked at him and noticed the annoying messages before she warned her mother.
The police were interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers at the address and discovered "convenient" web searches using terms to find inappropriate childish images.
Hogg later claimed to the authorities that his motive was to "manage pedophiles on the Internet" and "act like a cop and intimidate them".
Financial adviser Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it was an addiction - an addiction that scares people.
He admitted the searches were made by computer, but he said he did it to act like a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
Questions were asked about interviews with the unknown person who sent him pictures and asked him to send more pictures.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he got sick thoughts when he drank and wanted to watch rape and murder footage.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When she found the messages on her phone, she called her mother in a loud voice, trembling and crying.
Mom saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone, and the accusations followed.
He interviewed her and she said she used a computer and a Playstation to make her look younger than the defendant.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, was found guilty of taking or producing inappropriate child pictures on 14 June last year, breaching bail on 25 January this year and failing to appear in court on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim said Hogg should not be classified as a sex offender because it could be argued that the offence did not have "a clear sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the case to October, when his social history report will be released.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but was remanded in custody for other unusual cases.
Sexual assault was registered before the date of sentencing.
In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe made a wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was marred by allegations that opposition MPs received anonymous death threats if Mr Mugabe was to be beaten during his speech.
Last month, in his speech to the nation in parliament, he was stolen and repeatedly cut off - he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received messages on their cell phones to prevent Mr Mugabe from disturbing him during his speech.
"When Mr Mugabe's speech is over, the message to the journalists comes from a number that doesn't appear, but the title is 'death,'" he said.
He tells members that immunity is in effect in parliament and that immunity doesn't work when they leave parliament.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "downcast" by threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard will cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in a bid to restructure and cut costs in corporate services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating its computer and printer operations from its faster-growing hardware and service operations.
HP said in a statement that expected layoffs would result in a cost of about $2.7 billion early in the fourth quarter.
Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will chair the post-separation unit, said, "These restructuring activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company".
"Whitman said Hewlett Packard would be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we would have a broad and deep portfolio that would help companies transition to a new way of doing business", he said.
As a separate company, we are in a much better position than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard will generate annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will "focus on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions for companies".
He divides his Palo Alto garage into two companies, called "The Birthplace of Silicon Valley", founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
HP, the world's largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in the United States, is making this move one of the latest moves in the industry in the belief that tightly focused companies are doing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says Wilshere's injury before the match at Dinamo Zagreb has caused problems for his teammates
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's disability occurred in September and that treatment was planned, there was no reason for him not to play during Christmas time.
The best-case scenario already means Wilshere will miss at least four games in England, and in his past it seems uncertain whether he will attend the European Championship next spring.
The most embarrassing part of the latter problem is that Wilshere finished last season strong after suffering a separate ankle injury and then reviewed his previous pre-season acuteness.
This kind of disability career is not threatening, Wenger said.
It's a bone that hasn't healed.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
It's not related to her wrists or previous injuries.
From a medical perspective, this may be true, but as Wenger would agree, there is a risk that a midseason player who makes a comeback will get injured further.
There's also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
According to a study by Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different disorders since his inception six years ago.
He has played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
At large Arsenal are one of only two Premier League teams to lose in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, mostly due to injury.
Wenger acknowledges the potential of a short-term cycle, but Arsenal believes that he will continue to recover from his injury record last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury you have a period of injury, it's a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust that, and I believe he'll have the career he deserves.
The Champions League match will begin Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, ahead of Arsenal's Saturday match against Chelsea and next Wednesday match against Tottenham Hotspur, Wenger prepares the team for it.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, so it makes sense that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are playing.
Wenger could start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to protect the ocean and give the players the breath they need", Wenger said.
Despite being Arsenal's open favourite of Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most feared stadiums in Europe.
Dynamo have been undefeated 41 times since they launched their "Lost" campaign last season.
The stadium was hit by a magnitude 3.2 earthquake on the Richter scale on Tuesday night.
This is the tenth earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned the necessary lesson from their defeat to Monaco in the Champions League last season and remains motivated by the club's far-reaching goal of achieving its first European Cup victory.
"That motivation is huge", says Wenger.
It's never happened at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm experienced enough to be realistic.
We're passionate, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendship
It's striking that there are no similar portals in the programs, especially at a time when men are more in need of opening up and when the suicide rate among young men is at its 15th peak.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death for men aged 20 to 45, and it was three times more common in men than in women.
To draw attention to this issue, the Campaign Against Sefil Life (CALM) has declared 2015 the Year of Men and aims to counter the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to accomplish this challenging task.
A study of more than 2,000 high school students who had depressive symptoms found that a person with depression had a double chance of recovery if they had a high number of "healthy-mod" friends.
Similarly, a circle of mentally healthy friends for non-depressed people halves the potential mental challenges.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it has to be accessible first.
In this age of mass communication, social media is focusing on style rather than content, making it more important to respond quickly than to meaningful communication.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look like strong, fun-loving, successful people, even if everything is really about isolation.
Artificial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status -- which are intrinsic values that have deeper implications for our mental health -- our inner desire for personal growth and friendship.
As a billionaire video game creator recently revealed, money can't buy much happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned that focus backwards.
Characters were identified not by their actions but by their personalities, and they showed this through their interactions with their friends.
The frequent hugs of Joey and Chandler, the moments of football in comfortable chairs, Ross's affair with Rachel, all came from knowing that men could actually relate to them even if they were backward in their ability to express their feelings.
A helpful employee told me: "...when I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I see how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference".
Most of the men we've contacted don't talk to their friends.
A feeling of "going away" is very strong, and so is the idea that being open to others is a sign of weakness".
One of the programs that came to mind when I suggested long-term coping mechanisms was Friends.
He highlighted the small moments of his boyhood.
My goal is that a stranger's status on the phone helps people in times of crisis, but long-term support comes from family and friends who have close personal networks.
And if you're going to the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, in this beautiful environment where the scenes are redesigned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink?
Or, even better, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship will make.
Friends is on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria's goal made it easy for PSG to beat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malmö.
Di Angel Maria has made it easier for PSG to pass the goal he threw to Swedish side Malmö on Tuesday at the start of the Champions League.
Here's the match report and match reactions.
In the match where Di Angel Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target, Paris Saint-Germain began the Champions League match with a comfortable and clear final 2-0 victory over Malmö at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria became the PSG player who kept the French champion on his way to the Champions League with a goal he scored just four minutes into the game, but they did not take advantage of the opportunity until Cavani scored his second goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, who were in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, not only to get out of the preliminary groups but also to improve on their quarter-final performances in the last three championships.
But the game they played for scoring was not the best game of the season for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of time on the penalty area and was later sidelined with him in 1999 against his hometown team, where he started his glorious career.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League on and off the pitch, and in this respect, a 2-0 win will create problems for our opponents and it's a good start to give a comfortable look back, even if there are some things we need to improve on during the season", Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
I'm glad we didn't score more than a goal or two, but we wanted to win and we won.
Ibrahimovic returned to Paris after an injury, with one of the three player changes in the 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Ligue 1 over the weekend, but was shadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was seen as a player who would take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was transferred from Manchester United last month, and Marco Veratti's passing showed that those who thought so were not wrong when he ran behind Malmö's defense and passed Johan Wiland with a nice shot that sent him to the Phillies from a far corner.
However, everyone was disappointed in expecting PSG to win a big victory.
Malmö, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs to advance to the final, was lined up with nine international players, a five-man defense and two players in midfield depth, a heavy contender.
In the 34th minute, they made very few strikes except for the one that tore the corner pole that Nikola Djurdjic, Kevin Trapp, protected.
PSG, on the other hand, allowed them to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and inefficient final blocks, Ibrahimovic failed to make the final move in at least five strikes in the first half and disappointed Cavani by not keeping up with his game when he started the second half.
However, when it came to organizing his colleagues, he proved more skilled, it was Ibrahimovic who gave the pass of Di Maria's false hit to Wiland's castle in the 52nd minute.
The second goal came after an hour's fill, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season with the head that Maxwell had revealed from the left wing after Ibrahimovic's pass.
The idea of Malmö returning to the game was exhausted and after Ezequiel Lavezzi, who later entered the game, scored an unregulated goal, Wiland perfectly saved David Luiz's shot in the empty position and did not allow the score to change.
Later Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted that PSG was a class superior to his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level as him.
The equipment in hand is not enough.
He's going to Paris with a hat on.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore earned $2.5 billion in stock sales.
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore plunged its prices from the falling processed goods and earned $2.5 billion by selling its shares on Wednesday as part of a debt-sharing plan.
Glencore, which is listed in London, has announced that it has sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, was severely affected by falling commodity prices due to China's economic slowdown, which has led to an increase in demand and caused market turmoil.
The legal issue caused Glencore's stock prices to rise in the early hours of Wednesday morning on the London Stock Exchange.
Shares in the FTSE 100 index rose 0.69 percent to 2.77 percent and jumped to 131.60 pence.
Glencore last week announced a $2.5 billion stock sale plan last week, part of plans to cut its $30 billion debt pile by a third.
The company sold its new shares for 125p, down 2.4 percent from Tuesday's closing.
He sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over China's long-term growth cut iron ore prices by roughly half, while coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House has confirmed Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
The statement said Xi's first official visit to Washington would take place on September 25 and would be a return visit to Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November.
After the two heads of state's bilateral talks, President and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
The statement also stressed that "President Xi's visit will expand US-China cooperation on regional and global issues as well as bilateral relations and allow President Obama and President Xi to constructively address disputed issues".
Xi, who made his first visit in February, is expected to visit Seattle before Washington and meet with some US technology leaders, and then move to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to address Washington's concerns about claims that China is conducting cyber espionage activities among themselves and some controversial issues involving China's claims of sovereignty over the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes the diversity of filmmaking seem insignificant.
Matt Damon opposed African-American filmmaker Effie Brown by saying that it was not necessary to be behind the camera during a debate about diversity.
In the Sunday Night episode of Project Greenlight aired on HBO, Brown cut the experience actor's words while stressing the need for alternative perspectives on the black main character in the project's chosen script.
Damon said that when we talk about diversity, you do it not in the cast of the show, but in the cast of the movie.
Shockingly, Brown reacted to the actor's comments on the Martian film with comments like "Yeah!
Damon and Brown were brought together by co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
Brown said first, "I wanted to make people think about how they're going to treat the character of the match, whoever the director is".
The only black character is a whore who was shot by a white chatterbie.
Dear White People's publisher insisted on the film's rights for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio, to whom Damon replied that their assignments "may end up in ways we don't want".
There was a burst of discontent on social media after the debate was aired about Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the cut, writing, "Matt Damon can explain his diversity about this person as painful to WHITE FAMILY because he talks about the only black person in the room".
After the tweet was sent, it received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came at a time when the media was at the forefront of social debate about racial correctness.
After being killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement effectively encouraged lawmakers and officials across the country to stop discriminating against people of color.
In February, singer Prince spoke about the movement in the top cover during the Grammy Awards for Album of the Year nominations.
He said the albums are still important.
Albums are as important as books and black lives.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued a statement in response to a question on Fox News about whether Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a prominent figure in the group, should be considered a hate group.
The leaders said the Black Lives Matter Network is a love group.
It was recently announced that Damon was added to the list of performers, producers and media executives invited to visit the Pope to discuss the definition of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not yet known whether he accepted the invitation or whether he met the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned his first champion
Professional rock climber and comedian Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the $1 million prize in the American Ninja Warrior program on Monday night.
This competition, now in its seventh season, has never seen a competitor complete all the stages of the obstacle course.
In the season finale, Caldiero and Geoff Britten managed to make it to the final round.
The last assignment was to climb a 20-meter rope in 30 seconds.
Britten became the first person to complete this parking lot in time, thus becoming the first athlete to complete the challenging 4th stage of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero won the race by finishing the parking lot three seconds ahead of him.
After this difficult victory, Caldiero spoke to E!News with the shock of having won the grand prize of $1 million.
Isaac told E!' about a big raise in his salary, "I think it's amazing to even think about it, I've never made or lived more than $10,000 a year".
I mean, it happened in a moment... I can't even imagine what the future will be like... unknown.
Producer Kent Weed also interviewed The Hollywood Reporter for the final and explained why Britten would not be given any prizes, even though she was the first contestant to finish the parking lot.
The rules say money is given to the fastest.
Weed said, "If you finish more than one, you win the prize for the fastest finisher".
Money is a great prize and it changes lives, but he won a great prize.
I don't think he has a bad idea about that.
He's so happy he did what he did.
He got tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a great family man.
A hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone is gonna beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac".
I think if they changed roles, Isaac would have thought the same thing.
American Ninja Warrior has renewed the contract for an eighth season, and filming will begin in Spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers have been through the Minnesota Twins.
The second half of the season wasn't very enjoyable for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of baseball's best, the Tigers are now in the final season of the American League Central.
The Tigers, who were turning their game into a mess, made a perfect game Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins have missed the American League Wild Card by overcoming the Houston Astros by half a point.
For Detroit, it was a return to a very poor second half of the season, even for one night.
As Tigers manager Brad Ausmus put it, "victories are all fun, no matter what".
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon scored three runs in Detroit's first two innings, showing early attack support, and scoring once in the sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) made six 3/1s, three of which were runs.
It was only the third good start of his last nine rounds.
"I just want to close the year strong", Simon said.
It's hard for the seven-year-old to miss every game, so I wanted to get into the game.
Tigers hitter Victor Martinez hit three home runs and two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
This was Martinez' first of three nights on the road in four starts against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He shook the stick", said Ausmus.
He looked good (in training), already he was obviously better at BP, which he continued in the game.
At the end of the seventh inning, the Twins, who had three runs, had the best chance of getting back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton started the batting order by pairing the left field line.
Right-back Aaron Hicks was only able to make a slow hit and Simon caught second-row Brian Dozier swinging for left-handed BlaineHardy before lifting him to hit.
Mauer, the only player to brave Miguel Sano, who overtook right-winger Drew VerHagen in the two-run, advanced.
In the second tie, VerHagen managed to draw third-point hitter Trevor Plouffe to a double.
Plouffe's strike at DP was his 27th in the majors this season.
After struggling to secure a run to Detroit's ninth, Mauer crossed the RBI and led the Tigers to a 5-4 lead over Bruce Rondon.
However, the right-hander was caught by Sano in three throws for the 55th rescue.
Detroit has taken advantage of the early exit of Phil Hughes, who has lost his form.
The Tigers have won three races in their first two shots against the experienced right fifty who have been out of the field for over a month due to back burns and have just recovered from injury.
"Obviously, this is not the game I want to play", Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable in the process and I managed to throw pretty well in the third".
After a successful first shot, Hushes took second baseman Ian Kinsler out of the game.
Right fielder J.D. Martinez's two-time outs left Victor Martinez on the first run of the match.
Victor Martinez competed with runners to cross the 0-21 mark in scoring position.
Third goalie Nick Castellanos followed with one right, winning another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown as he tried to make a third, so the threats were over.
The Tigers added in the second, an out-two from catcher James McCann and a two-out from midfielder Anthony Gose to make the score 3-0.
Paul Molitor, manager of the Twins, said it was a big hit.
He didn't hit it very well, but he did it right.
Hughes, who counted the shots, threw three scoreless shots until he was replaced by right-handed saviour A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with six counts of three runs and four unearned runs.
Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was ruled out for the shoulder pain he used to throw.
He's going to be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to shoulder pain, is scheduled to start work on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, the LHP will start with Daniel Norris DL against the Twins.
In four games since the David Price transfer on July 30, Norris and the Tigers are 1-1.
He hasn't played since August 20 because of right side pain.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will be facing Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) in the second round.
Xi wants to open up the economy more to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform-managing group that the economy needs to be more open to the outside world to accelerate growth.
At the 16th meeting of the Leadership Group of the Center for Strengthening General Reforms, the President said, "China should develop opening-up policies by specialising in foreign investment".
Xi said that while encouraging openness, new reforms would create a new space for economic growth, bringing new energy and vitality.
The leadership group adopted a series of recommendations, including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border control policies, encouraging the inclusion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into private capital, and a review of the settlement registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be prepared, identifying sectors and industries that are prohibited from investing.
The system will be tested in phases and developed through test programs.
This is an important step, because it will play a greater role in allocating resources to the market and make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also relax its controls on companies, allowing them to run their own businesses.
The statement also said that China will examine new models of cross-border economic cooperation in border areas and will put in place new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
More space will be opened up for private investment to open state-controlled sectors.
The statement said "the government will not change its foreign investment policy, and will provide better services to foreign-funded companies by protecting their interests".
In addition, the acquisition of permanent residence permits or green cards by foreigners will be facilitated by optimising requirements and streamlining application processes.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the right of lawyers to practice and training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to a statement released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
The miniature bag is now very fashionable-Time Newspaper Friday Eve
In the fashion world, roads go round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and and and and and and round and and and and and and and and round and and and round and and and and and and and and and round and round and and and and and and and round and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
And the current trend of the last few years is that the miniature ones...
You could say that the little bags attached to the adults are also noticeable.
They say everything small is beautiful.
I think that's the same with bags.
When I was almost unable to get through the streets with suitcases and suitcases, the wind started blowing in the opposite direction, and the bags tended to shrink.
We already had small bags, but this time we were faced with the shrinking shape of the large handbags.
Only your phone, credit card and key can fit in these little bags.
The current, which began with Céline and Hermès, spread to Prada.
The transformation of bag fancy into miniature curiosity has also influenced new models.
Loewe has offered the fun bags he's been making this season in two sizes.
The most elephant-looking ones come out of the panda, polar bear and elephant-shaped bags.
The mini-sizes of the big bags, which luxury brands offer with phenomenal names, seem to have once again attracted the most red carpet celebrities.
Hermes' gift bag to Jane Birkin is one of his favorites.
Although Jane Birkin has said in a press release that she doesn't want her name mentioned on a bag, that's how she's now in the memories.
And the fashion weeks have seen the mass movement of the minibag.
And on the podium, there's a little bag coming out.
They're so tiny, you can't really put them on your arm.
They can be used with long cross-sections.
But on the podiums, we saw those long hangers wrapped around the wrists of the models.
Fendi is one of those guys who takes the minibag thing to the next level.
He has a suggestion for those who can't fit in a minibag, but can't give up on them.
Big bags are mini-bags.
How is that?
By turning minibags into bags that can be attached to their big ones.
This performance, which has been prominent on the podium, has been met with a rapid response on the street.
Let's see what else we can see!
Changes in skin tone
Turkey is on a level to compete with world brands in terms of name.
He's now enriching his experience in manufacturing with design.
Loft is one of them.
We're seeing black models, which used to be a few, now take their place on the shelves every season.
In a season when blacks are so up and running, the so-called "best friend" has found a new one.
Leather pieces and leather-detailed designs stand out as rebellious to the denim.
Generally, short-circuit models called "motorbikes" are on the rise.
The strong skin air is complemented by black pieces, long skirts, bright sweaters, and sporty looks.
In the old days, young people would wear so-called clothes and want to get lost in the crowd.
It was supposed to save the day.
Now, young people want to wear a piece that emphasizes fashion as well as comfort.
In this respect, it is possible to say that Loft correctly understands the target mass with the collections and complementary parts that he has prepared.
Small for Banksy, big step for global.
The world premiere of the collection "The Art of Banksy", which brings together works by mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The exhibition is the first exhibition of the Global Railway building, which is the product of the artist's 15 years of work and the first time that 85 original works have been assembled.
The first exhibition of mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul was opened the day before at Global Karaköy (Rhihtüm Caddesi).
The world-famous artist who hides his identity and uses a pseudonym, of course, was not at the opening.
We don't know if he's come to Istanbul.
But according to the curator of the exhibition, Steve Lazaridas, Bansky is not even aware of this exhibition.
There's no reason to ask him for permission.
Because old friend Bansky and Lazaridas' path has been broken after 12 years.
Some of the exhibits are collected by Lazaridas and others by collectors.
But there are things that Bansky fans are curious about.
I wonder what Banksy would think of the exhibition "The Art of Banksy", which collects 85 works.
For example, how would he pay for a ticket to the exhibition (35 TL) if he saw a small shop built at the end of the 800-square-meter gallery area?
Would you say that your work, which highlights the world's wounded, like the Girl with the Red Balloon, the Cleaner, the Rose Now, is printed on cloth bags, wallets, necklaces?
The fact that the exhibition of an artist with an anarchist spirit who hides his identity has become such a consumer item is a disappointment to Banksy's followers.
It's not Banksy's style.
But you still get a limited number of tickets before you run out!
The Art of Banksy, the big exhibition for Banksy's small, globalized world, is open until April.
They are the lowly, the unjust.
If they go, dig a hole.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued to react to the academics who signed the bill.
Erdoğan said, "These are the wrongdoers, these are the lowly ones".
Indeed those who are with the wrongdoers are the wrongdoers.
He said, "They have committed the same crime, because they were with the murderers".
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who left a carnival at the site of the Sultanahmet blast, said: "I shared our sorrows with the German president and chancellor, both with the German president and with the German Chancellor, about the death of 10 of our German friends in this action on Sultanahmet Square, which is a place of peace and history.
I wish to extend my condolences to the entire German people and to the families of the dead".
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination", he said.
Erdogan, who continued to react to the academics who signed the announcement, said: "I once again especially condemn, I strongly condemn, academics who stand up to all these terrorist incidents and publish a cover announcement and sign the underlying massacres".
It's not that our people understand who they are much more clearly, that being a professor, a docent in front of them, makes anyone more aware.
These are people of darkness.
These are the wrongdoers, these are the lowly.
They've committed the same crime because they're with the murderers.
So, in the case of Chinar, where are these kids, the three-year-old Mevlid who was martyred with his father, going to put these dark academics?
How do they fit into their consciences to be with his killers?
I invite all the courts, the senate of the universities to serve because of these actions against our constitution and laws.
Yesterday, I said the steps to be taken must be taken quickly.
Whatever they do, let them do it there.
Those who want to make politics, make politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, they should go and dig a ditch or climb a mountain.
I'm speaking so plainly.

'I found 26 men looking for two wrestling boys'
The second documentary of Mete Gümürhan, "Young Pehlivanlar", 66.
It was the first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February).
Gümürhan, who is originally from Edirne but has a production company in the Netherlands, explained why and how he completed the documentary he shot in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Competitors" tells the story of a six-year-old high school student from Amazia who aspires to become a world champion in wrestling.
Young Pehlivanlar, the first Turkish-made documentary to be nominated for the Crystal Bear Award.
Although born and raised in Holland, he is a director from Edirne, Mete Gümürhan.
When he was a child, he heard stories of greasy wrestling from his grandfather in Turkey, where he came on summer holidays, and watched the matches.
"There are no political problems in Turkey".
I wanted to tell the world what else was happening in Anatolia.
"For example, wrestling is unfortunately not well known among our horse sports", he says, "and he wants to get together with six directors and create a documentary project".
This project is unsuccessful, but one day the magazine news he reads on the plane opens the door for another project for Gümürhan.
'We stayed at the sugar factory'
Mete Gümürhan, who tracks down the letter about two younger brothers, ages 10-11, goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The kids' father won't let them shoot for a documentary.
The customsman explains how he overcame this challenge: "I thought about what I could do all day.
Because the Ministry of Culture could have withdrawn support".
Dad was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the kids would go.
I thought I'd go there.
I was looking for two kids and I ran into 26 kids who were wrestling at school.
We started shooting in a week and finished the holidays.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the sugar factory's dormitory".
The filming of the documentary, completed in three weeks, was the biggest challenge the director faced.
Gümürhan, a foreign film director and sound engineer, said that three different languages were spoken on the set.
"They didn't know Turkish either", he says.
Young Wrestlers focuses on the stories of six of the 26 child wrestlers.
Raised by his grandfather and suffering from weight problems, Aaron, who can't attend training because he broke his arm, ambitious but ill-healthy Beytullah, the school's cute kid Hope, the youngest champion Ahmet and Muhammad who holds the group together...
Mete Gümürhan describes his work with children: "I left them completely natural".
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I shot the first week and a half of training.
I wanted the kids to act like they didn't have a camera.
"But they got used to it so fast".
It was a surprise to be chosen for Berlin.
Mete Gümürhan, who said that he did not expect Young Actors to be selected for the Berlin Film Festival, said: "We had the preparation but it was a surprise that we were selected for Berlin".
Young Contestants is not a sports documentary, it's a production that tells the struggles of children and takes a break from their lives.
"I wanted to highlight the stories of children struggling to identify and coping with their problems".
Support for academics from the art world
The storm that erupted after the announcement of the "Academics for Peace Initiative" last night led to the opening of the investigation and detention of the academics, and there were backlash statements.
The first support came from literary figures, including many famous names.
The day before, the filmmakers and the theaters announced their support.
The statement, signed by 138 theatrical artists, states, "...We stand by this honorable meeting of academics who call for peace as artists working in the field of theatre and performing arts, declaring that we stand by freedom of expression, equality, right to life and unconditional peace".
"We join our conscience and wholeheartedly in the call of academics for negotiation and peace".
More than 400 filmmakers including Deniz Türkli, Atilla Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbacak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Honur Ünlü, Yeşim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik and others have said, "We are with free thought and art.
But if you say, "We are not partners in this sin",
We are with the Academics for Peace Initiative".
The Society of Cinematographers (SIAAD) said in a statement: "We stand with the academics who have become the target of the Link campaign".
The Academics for Peace Initiative issued a statement calling on the government to negotiate peace and harmony with its simultaneous declarations in Ankara and Istanbul on January 11.
The text was signed by 1,128 academics from 89 universities, as well as world-renowned thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, who are known for their theories and books.
President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoğlu have sharply criticized the academics' statement as "terrorist support", calling on the institutions to "do their duty".
After the call, some universities shut down academics, and prosecutors launched a stinging investigation.
Yesterday, a number of academics were arrested.
Your admirer, please help!
The red hair of Hürrem Sultan, the nose of Beren, the hair of Justin...
Although trying to be a celebrity is somewhat normal, it's seen as a psychological disorder after it starts to affect your life completely.
Celebrity worship syndrome, or celebrity worship syndrome, is a topic that has become an academic topic in the world and we're just starting to talk about.
It's pretty normal for ladies to run into the hair salon with their famous photos.
But we must not forget the year of the Hürrem Sultan, when all the teenagers wandered around Ireland with red hair.
It's been reported that Berenstain Beard has been the subject of a 2015 aesthetic surgery.
It's not much different on the gentlemen's front.
Once upon a time, it was common to dress like a Polat Alemdar.
Now, the opposite wind is blowing.
Justin Bieber's copy is full of boys around us.
So much so that this unnecessary information we've quoted has been read thousands of times online: "First, when you go to the barber shop, cut the sides of your hair, the earbuds, and the surroundings to the top of your head".
Only the sides will be short.
After the cutting is done, you should shave your hair with light water.
Once the shaping process is complete, fix your hair with spray.
"Justin's hair needs to be shaped when it's wet".
All of this brings to mind the newly-discussed celebrity worship syndrome, which has become an academic topic in the world.
Celebrity fans are seen as love laundry.
Artists boast about their fan numbers and how much they've influenced them.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see it that simple.
It is especially debated whether teenagers decide what to eat, drink, listen, or wear according to celebrities.
Excessive attachment to inaccessible names, role-playing, is defined as mental illness.
Psychologist Sümeyye Demir admits that Turkey is lagging behind in its work in this area.
But he also ignores the fact that families have gradually become aware: "One of the fundamental issues of psychology is that one is at peace with oneself, that one is at peace with oneself".
In the past, it was not taken seriously that children would fill their rooms with posters, disguise themselves.
Now that's changing.
He feels the need to intervene.
"Passionate attachment to someone is a sign that something is wrong in a young person's life".
Fans on the emotional high-speed train
No danger, as long as you don't overdo it.
He suggests that you ignore signs like not wanting to get married, jealousy of his wife, preferring his dress.
We're talking about famous people with names.
It's pretty normal to be curious about them, to be interested in their lives.
But, according to the expert psychologist, the youngsters who miss the ball of the canter often say: "When there are no names in the family or in the environment that represent a child in terms of virtue and good behavior, that gap is certainly filled".
There's not always good examples.
"He copyses the unknowns, boy".
When we discuss how to approach them, Sumayye Ferr begins by reminding the celebrity that passion syndrome is more common in adolescence.
Considering that teenagers may be insecure, the problem is more easily solved.
While we complain about family limitations, we also encounter young people who look for support and compassion: "We have to take into account their emotional downturns".
New research shows that they are more difficult to control because of changes in their brains.
"The passionate attachment of a young man to an emotional train must be taken naturally, and approached gently".
Behavior can be changed
Psychologist Sümeyye Demir reminds the parents of the task of overcoming the fame cult syndrome:
Recognize his emotional distress, make sure you're calm before you get into it.
Never let him suppress your feelings.
To promote independence, state that you respect his admiration.
Instead of teaching by slandering, set a good example, and discuss names that will be role models for him.
Try to figure out where celebrities are in our daily lives together.
It would be helpful to read books about the real world of celebrities together.
You're bound to turn your communication into an adult-to-adult form.
Remember, addiction and motivation use the same pathways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accepting them as they are.
Be sure to seek expert support in science.
The angry and the angry are admired
The underlying cause of celebrity worship syndrome is the need for meditation and help.
Unstoppable love is actually a cry for help.
But unfortunately, it's not what it looks like.
And it's so common that it's not confined to one country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoglu points out that there are certain names in every country that are involved in television.
The syndrome is more about being attached to these celebrities: "They're extraordinary".
The vast majority do not have the resources.
And those who have them don't live like them.
Either because they didn't adopt or because they didn't dare.
"But those who don't have the means or the means continue to watch with the anger that they can't live like they do".
It doesn't really matter who's watching or who's spitting on the foam.
They're both very admiring.
They make money without effort, they're on the magazine's agenda.
Even knowing that will increase his fanbase.
Another advice from psychologist Sue Ferrer is to question the reality of those lives at this very point.
It's not to be overlooked that Sunni lives are at stake.
The support of the surroundings for the person who is passionate about fame is here to come.
But the person is persistent in admitting that the celebrity he's a fan of has problems just like himself.

Should I have a sagging bladder surgery?
Dr. Fevzi Ozgönül answers the questions in the corner of the Square newspaper.
I have stones in my gallbladder, and every morning when I wake up, I go to the bathroom two or more times a day with stomach pain after meals.
Could that be keeping me from gaining weight?
I'm just starting to take alkaline, but I'm not losing any appetite, I'm not losing any weight.
It's been that way ever since I was a kid.
What do I do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
A: The salivation stone is often accompanied by an infection.
These stomach pains that develop immediately after eating are also a sign that when you eat, the gallbladder shrinks and the inflamed gallbladder is emptied into the intestines.
The intestines, which are discomforting from the inflammatory bile, quickly try to expel the bile.
That's why you go to the bathroom so often.
You go to the bathroom often, so your food is thrown out of your system, and you lose weight slowly.
I think you need to treat this condition.
If you go to a gastroenterologist and I say, if you find out what I'm talking about, you can get rid of it with antibiotics.
But eventually, you may have to have gallbladder surgery.
The probiotic you're taking may reduce your complaints a little, but it won't pass.
I say you keep using the alkaline probiotic, no matter what.
Because the biggest helper to your weight loss is this probiotic powder.
I eat a lot when I'm stressed.
When I'm stressed and angry, I feed myself and lose weight.
How can I deal with this?
A: An overeating actually means that your energy needs are not being met.
It could be because you're not eating enough or you're skipping breakfast and lunch.
Another reason is that you can't digest the food you eat.
To do that, your digestive system needs to function properly.
If you don't have ulcers, reflux or something like that, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic.
You'll see a lot of benefit.
I'm not losing weight, the doctors don't know why.
There's usually information around your corner that's going to weaken.
It all makes sense to me, but I'm a little different.
I can't lose any weight.
And most importantly, I don't know why.
Doctors don't say anything.
A: Our techniques are not just about weakening, but restoring the physiological function of the body back to its ideal size.
Obesity and weakness are the same kind of disorders.
Weight loss and weight loss are treated the same way.
You'll lose weight when you eat sweets and pasta.
I think you've figured that out by now.
You may also be stimulated by carboxymptoma and gain weight through healthy eating.
So you've weakened away from your ideal body.
Our other patients have moved away from their ideal bodies by becoming obese.
You'll gain weight and you'll reach your ideal body, and they'll gain weight.
If the system goes away, you lose weight, they lose weight.
But first, the system needs to work properly.

A child who feels worthless is becoming "hated"
There are certain emotions that are inherent in the human world of feeling.
Fear, sorrow, happiness, confusion, anger, worry...
But feelings of hatred, resentment, and revenge are manifested in children over time and as a result of certain wrong attitudes.
Every human needs to be an individual, including childhood.
So she wants to respect her parents or her social circle, ask for their opinion on matters that matter to her, and be seen to be valuable.
These are the foundations of a healthy personality.
For example, in matters of interest to the child, such as not deciding for him (what to wear, what to eat), not caring for his wishes and instead promoting his own rights (sending a child to an instrumental course) is disrespectful of the child's personality.
Because a child who is not respected for his identity and existence loses the freedom to 'be himself', the defense mechanism reveals a sense of anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because anger and hatred are the opposite of acceptance", says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says that the child does not accept what is done to him through hatred, but tries to tell him that he is valuable to himself and to those around him.
Noting that the child's refusal to accept the situation and react in this way is a positive development in his personality development, the expert psychologist said, "Hate here means 'I am there too,' serving the purpose of preserving the child's self-respect".
"If the child is allowed to be an individual, hatred disappears", he says.
A child seeks to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred
Arslan notes that when children are exposed to verbal and emotional violence by their parents at a young age, both physically and spiritually vulnerable, neglect will make the child feel that their presence is not noticed, invisible.
"It can be a lack of emotional support", continues Leo, "not only (not caressing, hugging, kissing, attending school, or other things) but also a lack of physical support (e.g., food, drink, shelter, school needs, etc)".
It's a nurturing attitude that opens the door to anger and hatred.
Emotional and verbal violence involves acts of humiliation, insult, contempt, reproach, unnecessary and severe punishment, feelings of worthlessness, and shouting.
These behaviors are deeply touching because they are directed toward the child's personality.
"The child either loses self-respect by accepting these and spends his life struggling with feelings of worthlessness, unlovability, and incompetence, or tries to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred".
His teacher gave Boyko to Beşiktaş!
Dnipro, which wants to buy two footballers from Beşiktaş, is preparing for the second half at Antalya Belek.
Technical Director Myron Markevych spoke to the publishing company about 27-year-old Denys Boyko, who is on the black-and-white list.
Praising the national goalkeeper, Markevych said, "If the two clubs agree, I'll be happy if Boyko goes to Beşiktaş and makes him the champion".
The 64-year-old manager, who also mentioned the situation of 1990-born Brazilian stoper Douglas Silva Bacelar, who is planning to transfer President Fikret Forman and his team, noted that his student and Stuttgart from the Bundesliga were also interested.
Meanwhile, the details of the official offer from River Plate to Argentine player Jose Sosa have been revealed.

The football club will go to the Constitutional Court for the deleted score
Denizlispor will seek the right of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) arbitration board to remove 3 points for failing to meet the financial criteria by submitting an individual application to the Constitutional Court.
Denizlispor President Mustafa Shavluk said that the decision of the judging board is final and they will take it to the Constitutional Court.
The whisper, "The race track is over".
Good people can apply.
The jury was supposed to decide in three months.
The arbitration panel's working order required that the reasoned decision be announced within three months.
It's been four months since our application.
If the Constitutional Court says there's a violation of rights, we can get back to the situation.
"We're not going to leave you".
Shavulik added that his applications could be a first in the sports community.
Even a storm could not stop the hopes of the passengers
118 Syrian and Pakistani refugees who sailed from Bodrum on a boat and fishing boat for the hope trip were rescued by Turkish and Greek coast guard teams.
105 Syrians, including women and children, who tried to cross the Greek island of Kalimli (Kalimnos Island) on a 15-meter fishing boat from the Yalıkavak neighborhood of Küdür Mevkii, were hit by the rocks of Karga Island at 04.00 this morning.
Turkish Coast Guard rescued the Syrians trapped on the rocks with the help of fishermen.

Romania is moving towards transparency in election spending
In Romania, a new bill is being drafted to determine the exact source of the money used for elections and to bring an upper limit on spending.
The government wants transparency in the financial contributions of politicians and companies who sponsor elections.
The bill also proposes to overturn the 'decision money' used in elections.
The bill requires every party or individual to spend money on election propaganda through a bank account.
All the money spent in this way will be controlled more transparently and regularly by the Romanian Election Commission (AEP).
The plan also plans to increase spending.
