You didn't tell him anything?
Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen.
She knows exactly what she wants.
- Hey, there.
Did Tom forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, time to get up.
The baby cried all night.
She didn't like living in the city.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do what you want.
That man you saw last night is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf in spite of the rain.
What kind of test is that?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because it's good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
The teacher is teaching.
What do you see in him?
What do you see?
It's not what you think!
You can buy a dog in that barbershop.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same.
It's simple and intuitive.
How many hours a week do you work?
Yeah, two.
They're not helping.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later, we all die.
How long will that take?
- It's a shadow.
Where is the German embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is beautiful.
But he knew it couldn't go on.
I guess not.
I want it too!
She's looking but she can't see anything.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in prison.
I didn't.
Any universe that is simple enough to be understood is too simple to create an intelligence that can understand it.
We shouldn't have rushed.
- Please?
It doesn't matter which team wins the match.
He's on the run.
This dress is too big for me.
Go stand by your car.
Bring her a plate of lettuce.
We're at war.
She didn't answer.
I heard that Mary wants a divorce.
Is this a chicken or a turkey?
My father's coming home tomorrow.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.

When I was in high school, I woke up at six o'clock every morning.
You guys are the best shooters.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
You've obviously done this before.
Did you get the letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
You're the one who did it.
She refused my request.
Which do you prefer?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to lunch.
You're still green.
There's nothing in here.
You never know what's gonna happen in the future.
We make squirrel-shaped cookies.
Everyone likes dolls.
What have you done to deserve this?
Look at the example above.
Her hat looked very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can you come at nine?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't had his help, I'd be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
What are you doing here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom isn't here yet?
Millions of people lost their lives in the war.
Compare your sentence with the one on the board.
She greeted him cheerfully.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't know what's happening to me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Do not expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
You have to be creative.
I couldn't understand what he was saying.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Get back to your seats.
Be friendly.
Isn't this a beautiful morning?
At least it's a story.
I'm getting more and more gray hair.
He turned off the light.
I'm not sleepy.
The sky is blue.
The old woman fell and couldn't get up.
They fell asleep after the movie.
You can use my dictionary.
I want to talk to your uncle.
Tom likes you.
He rarely stays home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Tom started screaming for help.
His son is eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
What time did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy one pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't go now. We're going to lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
He's an old man with no memory.
Eat your bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Tom can't speak English.
The school is five kilometers from my house.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be good.
Please come.
Women are changing the world.
In Singapore, spitting on the floor is considered a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
The smell of roses filled the room.
Sometimes evil wins.
Tom has already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're the one who did it.
What are you doing there?
What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
What's that?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's not worth it.
It had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, and the wings of a bird and the tail of a serpent.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it's not raining, then let's go.
Who's coming with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'm going to France for a vacation.
You can sit wherever you want.
You're an engineer.
The door opened slowly.
At least that's history.
Do you play any sports?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about lives here.
Please just go.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you'll see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I was talking to some friends.
All your cats are gray.
I still remember the time we used to go hiking together.
When we go to sleep, we say good night.
The scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complicated individuals.
He was so poor that he could not even buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he will most likely come.
I know you know that I know.
Be home before six.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles lit up the room.
I'm sorry, I was just...
Fold the paper in half.
What does he say in the letter?
The woman is eating bread.
I'm eating an apple.
A lonely person takes pleasure in watching ants.
Who is that man sitting at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
I'm really tired now.
His steps accelerated.
The eternal silence of these vast spaces frightens me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take off your hat when you enter the classroom.
They do nothing but complain.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
Tom got up at seven.
This one's for us.
I'm listening to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza by himself.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need to be patient, Tom.
How you doing?
Your journey begins here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you've been.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to the new pier.
Everybody knows her.
She is incredibly naive.
Where in Turkey do you live?
Tom is gone.
I can't. I can't.
Get out of the classroom.
There are three dogs sleeping on my mom's carpet.
Tom has already finished the work he needed to do.
If you can't have kids, you could always adopt.
That's what I thought.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still missed the bus.
They need friends.
Beef, please.
Can you wrap it up as a gift?
You like living like this?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Are you sure you don't have a home?
Do you play chess?
Her boyfriend is a Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are many brewers in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
The parents expected too much of their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He came into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move it!
You can sit on the chair.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all the students like English.
That test was so hard, we didn't have enough time to finish it.
That's all I got.

If you believe that society has created nothing of value, you might as well believe in mass destruction.
English is spoken all over the world.
All their efforts were futile.

Gilly is the only girl in our club.
Students don't have to go to school today.
The sun disappeared behind the clouds.
His parents were pleased with his success.
This is our home now.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.

She paints her room white.
I can't leave until he comes.
I asked her to dance.
Have you done your homework yet?
John is a professor of French literature at Oxford University.
Do you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to begin your journey?
Your watch is ten minutes late.
They've been cheating on you.
I thought you said it was yours.
How much money do you have hidden under your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm from Ireland.
This is the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay his debt and disappeared.
Mr. Brown speaks Japanese very well.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone smiled except for her.
The queen was standing beside the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
- She's my first love.
You must keep your promise.
Tom looks different today.
What is the price of the room rent?
We have to get out of here.
Tom doesn't want to ever do that again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you been learning Esperanto?
They're not a threat.
Her advice encouraged me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does that tower visit?
It started raining heavily. That's why we played inside.
Your carpet is all white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I'm just like my mother.
You look just gorgeous tonight.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You know that, right?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom changed his clothes.
The heat is hot, so be careful not to burn yourself.
Did you find your letters?
For the love of God!
He doesn't remember if that room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories for women.
I don't like to be wrong.
It's not theirs.
I'm not used to getting up early.
Stay where you are.
It's her house.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you for real?
You've been busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Tom like?
That tree grows near her house.
Do not speak in the reading room.
How are you doing, miss?
I changed the yen into dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Tom is going to kill Mary.
There are only two right answers.
If I were rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where the hell did you put them?
Tom didn't show.
Don't be so serious. It's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This carpet is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why isn't anyone eating my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She translated it literally.
What a beautiful night!
I can't find Tim.
She named him Charles.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She's taking them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
No one believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I don't ever want to be in debt to anyone.
Look at the train going over the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really boring right now.
No, I don't think it was my fault.
Where are we?
I'm twenty-five years old.
Her hat looked funny.
Don't bother her, she's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just for this occasion.
It's a similarity.
Be careful, all right?
It's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
Don't you know the way?
I really like that.
Tom will need help.
I printed a hundred pages.
I see and I hear.
Don't forget your ticket.
Raise your hand before you answer.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true you have a gun?
I was in bed all day yesterday.
The war interrupted their research.
When spring comes, the days get longer day by day.
I'm listening to the radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.
This is Tony's book.
I should have come sooner.
Tom eats only what he wants to eat.

What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like summer.
By the way, what's your address?
She was lying on the bed face down.
African elephants are larger than Asian elephants.
What I always said.
He heard him crying in the middle of the night.

You should do it yourself this time.
My family was very hospitable.
You don't understand. I'm not going to.
She has green eyes and light brown hair.
Does Tom have experience?
She left her umbrella on the train.
I'm a vegetarian, you know.
You have to go there.
What's the reason?
I can't see anything from here.
Since I did not receive a reply, I wrote to her again.
She's standing behind the wall.
Don't expect too much from me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your rights.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I had one beer and pretended to be very drunk.
Tom didn't think he needed a bodyguard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her go into the park.
You don't seem busy.
It didn't seem like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
He's short and fat.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The journey was tiring.
He's a lot smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
The weather is terrible today.
I didn't want this to happen.
The dog is trying to break free.
Like I said, I'm not doing anything.
There's a little brown puppy behind that table.
Stop them.
Anne is very fond of chocolate.
I know Mike likes basketball.

Take the chair to your room.
The taxi suddenly turned left.
Yes, I understand, thank you.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

Who will inherit the throne?
She worked hard.
Don't be afraid of change.
Please open this box.
Is it healthy to eat fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her what kind of music she liked.
There are no mourners.
Is she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
She disappeared without papers.
I'm here a lot.
She continued her speech.
Mike can't play baseball well.
Hooves are often used when traveling in deserts.
Mary is a bookworm.
Have a good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
Stop wasting time and get back to work.
The more the merrier.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
It is perfectly normal to want to be happy.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
My arm hurt yesterday.
If I were rich, I would have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father doesn't eat much fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed me on the cheek and said good night.
My friend's here.
Where do you live now?
The older you get, the harder it is to learn a language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not everyone likes dogs.
I'm gonna stay here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that really true?
She's crying.
I'll see you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took his family to the zoo.
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
It's exactly half past nine.
This car was made in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make his robot!
Your brother wasn't at school today.
Tom will never let you down.
I was in Canada at the time.
I made this food myself.
Write with a pencil.
Someone wrote his name on the wall.
Anything that can go wrong will.
They're out of sugar.
I love your daughter.
Tom hopes he won't eat leftovers again tonight.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't be swimming in that pond.
When will the snow melt?
He thought I was very tired.
I think she doesn't want to eat anymore.
You're either with us or against us.
Please help me, I'm dying!
Tom knows that Mary likes him.
I like this music.
She's scared of the dog.
He went to the hairdresser's, but stopped by her house.
The snow falls quickly.
We're having lunch here.
Of course I should read this book.
Tom isn't in prison right now.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship disappeared over the horizon.
Good morning, my lovely dog.
God blesses those who repent.

The child cried all night.
Can you see me?
She testified against him.
My father grows rice.
We speak Japanese.
The results were disappointing.
I climbed in through the window.
The meat is not yet ready.
Give me a piece of chalk.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear something?
Is she your mother?
It's dark, can you turn on the light?
He doesn't trust the doctor anymore.
It was the first time I had visited a museum.
We had a great time.
I think Tom will want to sit down.
What a great family.
Are you still in Florida?
You shouldn't have eaten that raw fish.
Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Tom doesn't want to ever do that again.
I don't know what you mean.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything about this.
Our team lacked mobility.
The cat crossed the street.
There's a mirror over there.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I'm learning the Lozban.
"Good morning", said Tom with a smile.
My arm hurts.
He needs a ladder.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.

You have to choose your own life path.
Without air and water, no one could live.

They work eight hours a day.
I eat and drink.
I do that every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I take back everything I said.
Where did you get all those keys?
I got in through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He wrote our names down quickly.
Our son died in the war.
He's not happy with the result.
Obviously, you're wrong.
I can't tell who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We may as well all go
Who is that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
Everything that is brilliant is simple.
Her students are studying too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Take off your shoes.
The birds have flown south.
This tea is very good.
I don't agree with him.
I'm the one who did it.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a great idea.
He is very proud of his toy.
That's enough for now.
I'm not scared at all.
She wants to know the truth.
Is that word often used?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became a mailman.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took a piece of chalk.
Let me do that.
I like jazz.
I am convinced that he is innocent.
Open the window and let in some fresh air.
Have you ever worn a sag?
It's snowing hard.
Have you seen my mom?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Do you approve of what she's doing?
He came here before class was over.
Do you know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat was on my pillow and wouldn't get off.
There are a few good hotels in the city.
Who's this letter from?
He doesn't want to study today.
We're all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted to do.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She came?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, all right?
I bought a camera for thirty dollars.
This is great.
This is not a method, this is a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water's very shallow here.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell down the stairs.
He can interrogate people.
Bob was doing the dishes.
My brother is two years older than I am, but he is three centimeters shorter than I am.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Have you seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Tom is going to die soon.
I'm used to going to bed late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with the red roof.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're basketball players.
These clothes suit you.
Don't blame her for that.
You know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Tom couldn't find a reason why he needed to come home early.
Put your hand up.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
You don't seem busy.
Where's Mary?
The new contract allows us to demand whatever we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I'd call another floor later.
Oh, my God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
Have fun!
Tom, I'm back in the house.
You wanted to see me?
It's not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city centre.

You're a very nice man.
I've been to Boston a few times.
You're a very nice man.
