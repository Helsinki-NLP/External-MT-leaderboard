Write to me.
Years passed.
I know.
You can't do it without me.
You can't do it without me.
You better back off.
You better back off.
You'd better get home as soon as possible.
You do nothing but eat.
You have to sign this.
You have to sign this.
You have the right to have an opinion.
You're not doing that well.
You are so passionate.
You are so passionate.
You are a big talker.
You're the leader.
You run.
You run.
I'm in love with Mary, you know.
You tried.
You did an experiment.
You were supposed to wait.
You were supposed to wait.
