Rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends across EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly expanding across all countries, with varying stages depending on the country.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️


Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% cases are observed as a critical illness requiring acute care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country of the EU/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to its Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK with Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
On 11th March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
The first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as per WHO case definition was reported in the March 5th edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, with 17,750 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from Italy alone.
To achieve cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as countries' Ministries of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities and WHO, update the COVID-19 case count from each country in the world every day at 8:00 am.
The data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and compare it to the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we have thus calculated the 14 day summary cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 15th March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy in the period 31st January - 15th March 2020.
Trend of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK
The 14-day short cumulative prevalence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK generally follows that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 started to rise around 21 February and accelerated around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was mainly due to the sharp rise in the number of cases reported from Italy, but a similar upward trend in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 was seen in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (Supplementary Material).
Figure 2 shows cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to Italy in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
It particularly shows that as of 15 March at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to those in Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions and protocols for selecting patients, including detecting and testing, that should be tested for COVID-19 as necessary for confirmation.

The hospitalization and/or intensive care unit of COVID-19 cases is currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% respectively (figures not shown).
They should however be collected in a phased manner to supplement the current surveillance data which focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study, which was conducted in 2010-11, found a large gap in the availability of ICU and ICU beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (in 2010-11 12.5 ICU and Intermediate Care beds per 100,000 population).
90% of ICU bed capacity  Risk-related prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases Modelling of healthcare capacity saturation related conditions with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK is provided in the sixth update of ECDC's Acute Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
As cases have so far remained in herds in EU/EEA countries and some areas of the UK and hospitals and ICUs serve a generally defined regional population, information on cases and ICU beds should be made available primarily at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.

As indicated in the recent ECDC acute risk assessment, with the shift in approach to containment from mitigation, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as if not implemented in a timely manner, the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The Acute Risk Assessment also lists public health measures in addressing the impact of the pandemic.

Failure to do so, is likely to cause other EU/EEA countries' healthcare systems to face a sharp rise in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophic outbreak for humans.

COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is much more transmissible and affects older people and men more than young people and women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a topical and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics on epidemiology, purpose science, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of disease.


The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the related disease was renamed CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2nd March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with over 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and over 3,000 patients dying due to the virus.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is the enemy of the public number 1 and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7th January 2020, over 200 articles have been published on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, epidemiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment, which have isolated several patients and sequenced the virus.
This review seeks to summarize research progress on new and rapidly evolving subject areas.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other diseases caused by CoVs, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding disease prevention and prediction as well as some other nonetheless vital questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, causing about 15% of common cold 4.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As shown in Figure 1.1, the pneumonia swarm, whose origin was unknown, was first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
The CoV sequence was released seven days later.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️


The first clinical study on the disease on 24 January reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.

As the situation is escalating rapidly, the ultimate extent and intensity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
The following is a more up-to-date picture of the pandemic in a multi-central study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients on 11 February 2020 (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly those aged 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old and only 14 infected individuals were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4. 8 (3. 0 - 7. 2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 - 4.82.

The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and covert single-stranded RNA viruses.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
S-glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and then fuses to the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cell mass; after replication of the viral genome, the envelope forms genomic RNA variant-containing sheets with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then fused into the plasma membrane for release of the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new variant of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 sequenced samples collected from the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, the source of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV along with SARS-CoV-2.
, SARS-CoV-2's S protein binds to human ACE2 with greater weakness than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make novel short protein encoded by orf3b and secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in mix with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which contained both free and closed formations, was synthesized as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could bind two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and transmission of CoVs.
B0AT1 could be a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Basic and intermediate nutrients
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by civet cat and camel respectively.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
However, which intermediate nutrient helped the virus to cross the species barrier and infect humans is unknown and the route of transmission is yet to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans which involved similar recombination with S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolin - a long-spit, ant-eating mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine - is a potential intermediate carrier for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity to CoVs found in pangolin.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in artificial ambient dry environments for 48 hours and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to UV rays for 30 minutes at 56 °C; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
No detailed studies have been reported regarding immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).
Normally, once the virus enters the host, it is first recognized by the host's endogenous immune system from pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).

, SARS-CoV's N protein may help the virus avoid immune responses.
Pretty soon, the adaptive immune response gets involved in fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus - specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus - infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to assist the protective cells.
CoVs, however, can inhibit T cell functions by killing T cells.
Tri-dose immunity, including complement and antibodies such as C3a and C5a, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, immunoglobulins isolated from a recovered patient inactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overexposure of the immune system produces a very large number of locally free radicals which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases even multiple organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection with herd onset characteristics is more likely to affect elderly and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a larger number of viruses or whose immune functions are combined to be more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most often 3-7 days.
However, in 1,099 case studies, the incubation period was seen to be an average of 3 days and the range was 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, the recent study based on a demographic of 8,866 cases found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to other people is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus generally require a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the leading and early symptom of COVID-19 which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal discharge, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/ or hypoxemia within a week of onset of disease.
In severe cases, patients experienced a rapid increase in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever without pulmonary imaging abnormalities should be screened for virus for early diagnosis.
The end of December 2019 demographic study found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilation.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of the family herd and the herd generated by transmission from the asymptomatic individual.

However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them required ventilation and this is consistent with the higher fatality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
SARS patients have been observed to have fever (99-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) as the predominant symptoms and approximately 14%-20% patients required ventilation.
COVID-19 fatality rate was 2% as of 14 February, when the worldwide confirmed cases had reached 66,576.
comparatively, the SARS mortality rate was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases based on demographic study of June 2012.
The previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 had an R0 of 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 whereas SARS-CoV had an R0 of only between 2 and 4.
SARS-CoV-2 is compared to MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data indicate that the spread potential of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The herd usually starts with the same family or group of people or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within the last two weeks from onset.

In the early stages, patients have normal or low numbers of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and virulence with white blood cell counts including 1×109/L and 4×109/L were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated liver and muscle enzyme and myoglobin levels in their blood and most patients had elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocytes deposition in their blood.
In severe cases, the levels of D - dimers, a product of fibrin breakdown present in the blood, were elevated and the lymphocyte count steadily decreased.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in chest radiography and are shown by bilateral spotted images or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop unusual pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is severely compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
Type - I and type - II pneumocytes reduce surfactant levels and increase surface tension and thus reduce the lung's ability to swell and increase the risk of lung failure.
, the worst results of chest radiography often parallel the most severe stage of the disease.
The first pathological analysis on COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 showed pneumocytosis in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, formation of a haelin membrane and porous leakage of lymphocytes, and polynuclear polychondria which was consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and was similar to SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which can accelerate the pandemic, the diagnostic manifestations (which were no longer dependent on RT-PCR only) started to be used for diagnosis in China on 13 February 2020.
Same thing happened with the SARS diagnosis.
, combinations of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings are therefore necessary and imperative for making effective diagnosis.

If verified in clinical samples, it is hoped that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.

These therapies include current and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are scrambling to develop immunity and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs and possibly to a lesser extent other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.

, respiratory assistance is important for symptom relief and life saving and includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non - penetrating ventilation and penetrating mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used in the treatment of life threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.

It is known that cytokine storm occurs as a result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic endocrine response characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a large number of free radicals which are the major causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroid and tosilizumab, IL6-resistant monoclonal immunotherapy, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinin storm include alterations in T cell directed immune response; blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immunosuppressants were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.

Rather, they can produce serious side effects, dramatically affecting diagnosis, particularly non-vascular ossification.
However, short-term courses of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids are recommended for use with caution in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
As of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
, Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue given intravenously has been found to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdecivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Subsequently, Remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other acellular RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Barisitinib, interferon-α, iopinavir/ ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with iopinavir/ ritonavir.
Interactions of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and immunity production from recovered patients

actually, recovered patients have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Immunoglobulins (Ig) are antibodies produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign substances and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and directly inactivate them.
On this basis, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 critically ill patients.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are required to propose the method for large scale use.

For example, antibodies can overexcite the immune response and produce cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life - threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific immunizations at such a rapid pace to fight a global pandemic.
, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that codes for effective antibodies or to test for effective antibodies to the necessary proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of immunity.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a wide range of ailments.
However, its effects depend on the combination of different components in a different formula, based on TCM principles, to diagnose a disease.
Most effective components are still unknown or irrelevant because it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
TCM
For example, Shu Feng Ji Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
87% of patients using TCM including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%) saw the highest recovery rates in COVID-19 treatment in several provinces in China, while Hubei Province where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison as many other impact factors, such as number of patients and severity, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020 Boi Zheng and colleagues published a study to compare Western Medicine (WM) treatments only and combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed for body temperature to normalize, symptoms to go away and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
The most impressive was that the symptomatic deterioration rate (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) than in the WM group only and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group (8.8% vs. 39%).

It would also be interesting to identify the mechanisms of action and if possible to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed patients of COVID-19 experience a lot of fear from the highly contagious and deadly disease and even those who have been quarantined experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, infection symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and cough as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids can cause more restlessness and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychological illnesses were reported, including persistent stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, psychological symptoms, dizziness, even suicide.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine as part of the public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak may make people more uneasy and disillusioned about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and persons in contact with them as well as the general public.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with continuous and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain from germ cells and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by increasing viruses.
S protein-based vaccines have been developed to generate long-term and potent inactivating immune and/or defensive immunity to SARS-CoV.
Live-stemmed vaccines have been evaluated in animal models of SARS.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is probably because SARS gradually died out 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and swarms of MERS continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in epidemic areas.
Vaccine strategies for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits have been developed and some have been evaluated in germ models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunocompromised individuals is a critical and vital task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, the long time required in vaccine development (average 18 months) and the difficulty of overcoming the dynamic variation of CoVs is challenging.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire diagnostic process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without symptoms of other diseases.
, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
8,866 cases were studied in COVID-19 primarily in the 30-65 age group, with 47.7% of patients being over 50 years of age, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying conditions and complications and those who did not require them were significantly older (at median age of 51 vs 66), indicating age as a predictor of outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: Men are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Corrosions and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac damage and atrophy.
Cardiovascular events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes which can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have a deep correlation and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been proposed as a possible predictor of disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels with the severity of COVID-19 and diagnosis has also been proposed.

These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Key Diagnostic Symptoms: Chest radiography with other problems and the temporal progression of the diagnostic symptoms should be considered for prediction of consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as combination therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of the damage.
As high doses of corticosteroids became widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular osteoarthritis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if needed, the steroid should be used in low doses and for short term in COVID-19 patients.
Mental Stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from extreme stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often endured prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
psychological counselling and long term support are essential to help these people get out of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 has different epidemiological features from SARS.
As well as replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and produce mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection unlike other cold-causing CoVs.
, Infected patients can generate large amounts of virus during daily activities in the early stages or incubation period, with great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
, SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred when patients were very ill, whereas most transmissions did not occur during the early stages.
As such, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.


The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the descent phase will last for 3-4 months.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paul Hunter, et al., predicted that COVID-19 which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., modeled the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in both the mid-turbine and the throat of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the new virus identified may become a recurrent case, similar to influenza.
However, there are promising signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was initially projected to be a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in infectivity and eventually become extinct or a less pathogenic virus co-existent with humans.
The COVID-19 pandemic is compared to SARS and MERS below (Figure (Figure 55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which also raises new possibilities of oral transmission from feces.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients and 40 health care providers with pre-existing conditions, were probably due to clinical infections.
Therefore, great care should also be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and those in contact with patients or those who are infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets of fluid from going into the air from a potentially infected person or sticking to the surface of things, from where they can go to others.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As particles can pass even five surgical masks placed one on top of the other, health care providers in direct contact with patients should necessarily wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers should wear fit isolating gowns to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Virus can also infect a person through the eyes.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas is strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
The recommended distance for people to stay away from the patient is three feet.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, due to the extreme similarity to SARS-CoV, it would have made China extremely cautious based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the Director of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control consoled the citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human transmissibility and limited reproductive capacity and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message relieved the public of a lot of fear, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the critical time to keep the disease to a minimum in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful when making public announcements as every word matters to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal notification from doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive in limiting potential pandemics at an early stage rather than trying to console the public; and (4) frequently release targeted and effective practices to raise public awareness about the pandemic and periodically check and improve society's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to the recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older men and women more than younger people, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than in younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients often do so when they are seriously ill, which makes it much more difficult to limit the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads with greater speed and prevalence than SARS-CoV.
Shares-CoV-2s routine RNA testing may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.

SARS-CoV-2 - where did it come from?

Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, exactly how does the virus enter airway cells and subsequently undergo pathological changes?
Do the viruses also bind to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, gradually disappearing like SARS or recurring periodically like the flu?


The zoological origin of the human coronaviruses
Coronavirus (CoVs) and their vectors (including humans) have evolved simultaneously over thousands of years due to mutation and adaptation.

The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the devastating and deadly nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back into the limelight and has shocked us with a greater infectious capacity but decreased pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal disease and understanding the animal origin of HCoVs will help us.
Most HCoVs originated in bats, in which they are nonpathogenic.

The identification of animal nutrients has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In this review, we present an overview of the current information about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of discovery as well as zoogeographic origin and intra-species transmission.
Significantly, we compare and see variation of different HCoVs from the perspective of sequential evolution and gene recombination of viruses.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
also, the need for successful nutritional change and the implications of the progressive evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes groups of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
CoVs is the name given to the largest genome of RNA viruses, 26 to 32 kilobases, due to their crown - like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that have a similar structure.
About two thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyprotein is further processed to produce 16 non - structural proteins called nsp1 - 16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).

Based on variation in protein sequences, CoVs are divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence has shown that bats and bats are the gene sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, whereas birds are the dominant hosts of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually produce mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively high number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal discharge of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, further information has been collected by detailed studies about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.

The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating outbreaks in recent history, infecting over 8000 people with a crude case mortality rate of nearly 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak generated a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs are of zoogenic origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented tremendous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.

It may guide or facilitate the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 strains, intermediates and enhancers, with significant implications for preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoogenic origin, intra-species transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs are nonpathogenic in their natural cell membranes, but become pathogenic after intra-species transmission in the new membrane.
We will also review the trend of HCoVs evolving gradually with an increase in infectivity often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from nasal discharge of infected common cold patients, different CoVs were isolated from several infected animals including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.

A brief summary of the chronological history of HCoV discovery (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in 1966 from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections, which later adapted to grow in the cell lines of WI-38 lungs.
In 10 ~ 20% of cases, patients infected with HCoV-229E experienced symptoms of colds, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, along with fever and cough.
Then in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated by a sequential pathway in the milk mouse brain and by organ culture.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to infections caused by HCoV-229E which are symbolically indistinguishable from infections with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and are likely to be predominantly transmitted during the winter season with cooler weather.
Typically, the duration of progressive development of both these viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild colds.
Severe lower respiratory tract infection is seen in a few immunocompromised patients.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, was the first well-documented HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and the third HCoV detected, SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
SARS epidemic spread across many countries and continents with 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to the most transmissible, it was estimated that approximately two secondary cases could be increased due to each case with a progressive development period of 4 to 7 days and a maximum viral impact appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-CoV infected patients initially show symptoms such as muscle aches, headaches, fever, malaise and chills, followed by shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory-related abnormalities of SARS.
SARS patients also experience diffuse airborne damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation afterwards.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be especially fatal for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from a relative of the indicator patient by open lung biopsy who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been many efforts in research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
HCoV-NL63 is a common cause of chills, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis.
In another independent study, identifying the same virus from a nose sample of an eight month old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands was described.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and its peak occurrence occurs during the early summer, spring and winter seasons.
HCoV-NL63 is related to inhibitory acute-inflammatory, also known as croup.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide causing mild respiratory illnesses.
All four community HCoVs have been well adapted in humans and are unlikely to mutate to cause typically highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63 that recently reported causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and sustain themselves in humans they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Whereas most of the lab confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close relatives have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in 2015 in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS, characterized by progressive severe pneumonia, are consistent with SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which has been seen in HCoV-borne diseases so far only in MERS.
Over 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.


The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and also designated the disease as COVID-19.
As of 3rd March, 2020, there have been 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide with a crude case mortality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can grow rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 has interesting similarities and differences from the other six HCoVs by comparison and observation.
First, the pathological duration and the duration of the process of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is similar to SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are usually seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including nonspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also observes characteristic variants of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the infectivity of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it has yet to be verified whether the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it progresses to humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is also of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 can behave as seasonal as community acquired HCoVs.

HCoVs from all four mildly symptomatic communities have adapted well in humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans and those that develop serious HCoV illness in humans have been eliminated.

In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and infects more people, the more likely it is to become fully adapted in humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community acquired CoVs have been transmitted to the human population causing colds in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not need a host.
Conversely, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
They need to persist and spread in their animal genome and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least for now, it is very contagious, like community-acquired HCoVs.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted in humans and transmitted to humans without any coagulation or intermediate animal nutrients.

Animalia
The pathogen is usually well adapted and non - pathogenic in this nutrient.
Similarly, the cells provide shelter to the HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the nutrients are naturally infectious and are the natural nutrients of the HCoV or its parent virus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
This intermediate nutrient can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifier nutrient by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily and then transmitting it to humans to increase the level of human infection.
A HCoV can go into an end-infection if it cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate nutrient and maintain locality for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural nutrient.
The epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the indicator of SARS case was a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence checks indicated that there was a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG in animal traders than in the general public.
Masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in live animal markets were identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses which are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all the sevet of the markets were killed.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Significantly, since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV immunity, the possibilities cannot be denied that several species of small mammals may also be intermediate enhancers of SARS-CoV.

Follow-up discovery of natural zoonotic nutrient of SARS-CoV revealed a very close relative bat CoV called SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the carrier of emerging human pathogens.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from bat feces samples was demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptors for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of the recovering SARS patients was able to inactivate WIV1.


Genetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into a similar grouping to bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bates use the same nutrient receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses.
RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are genotypically close to bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.

MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
, Bates may not be the closest co-carriers of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels with hoofs like camels of Middle Eastern origin in several African countries are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific inactivating antibodies.
Live MERS-CoVs similar to the virus found in humans were isolated from the nasal cavities of hummingbirds, indicating that camels are the authentic cell-parent of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV generally showed mild symptoms but very high virus clearance.
Significantly, infected camels remove viruses not only from the respiratory tract but also from the fecal tract which is also the main route of virus removal from bats.

SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity to RaTG13 bats isolated from bats belonging to the Rhinolophus species.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is sufficient to determine ancestral linkage.
i.l, bates may not be the closest co-carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless nearly identical bat CoVs are found in the future.
Possible, SARS-CoV-2 intermediate zoonotic nutrients must have been from wild species sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market that were linked to many early cases of COVID-19 indicative of a potential zoonotic to human transmission phenomenon.

These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They belong to two subfamilies of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the genealogical lineage, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding region (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.

The previous study of diseased pangolins also reported finding clusters of viral DNA overlapping with lung samples, which were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of embedding methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence with a full length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate zoonotic nutrients for SARS-CoV-2.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The pathway for the progressive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be established.
Whereas the most sequence similarity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, have the most genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is highly speculative to think that the extreme similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively mediated convergence sequential evolution.
An alternative proposal is in favour of recombination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wildlife species.
As the driving force of progressive evolution, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The closest zoological origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Genetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, whereas ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mouse.
It was reported that bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachen Ridge CoV) found in three North American coloured bats was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 found in Ghana, although camellids are also suspected intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, the current information on the zoonotic origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Genetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in history.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The history of intra-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs have been found to be very close to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CoV.

First, humans and not alpacas have been in contact with bats in their shared ecological habitat.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, whereas Alpaca alpha-CoV caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses.

Alternatively, where bat alpha-CoVs are the gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and humpback camels may be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of intra-species transmission from bats to hummingbirds and hummingbirds to humans.
The gradual evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has been further reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange and interspecies transmission of genetic fragments.
Longevity, dense settlements, close social interaction and the ability to fly are all conditions conducive to bat being the ideal virus transmitter.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been entering hummingbirds for several decades.
It has been well adapted in these camels which have gone from intermediate nutrient to stable and natural co - nutrient.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has a sporadic transmission accident to humans and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.

In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolin.
They may be the ultimate carrier of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, like civet in the case of SARS-CoV.

First, bats may be co-carriers of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate enhancer nutrients in which SARS-CoV-2 related viruses were newly introduced.

It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being explored.
Besides the various animal nutrients, three major factors in relation to the virus are also important in smoothly crossing the species barriers of CoVs.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
CoVs have proof-reading exoribonucleases, whose deletion may lead to extreme variability and degradation or decreased viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is thought to suppress the replication of CoVs by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
Though, the mutation rate of CoVs is a million times higher than their nutrients.
Also, the mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
SARS-CoV-2 has a distinctly low mutation rate, indicating a high degree of adaptation in humans, compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In theory, it is unlikely that the genetic flow will rapidly inactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA in CoVs places extra plasticity on genome mutations for mutation and recombination, increasing the likelihood of intra-species co-sequential evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by a rich unique open reading frame and protein functions encoded on the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly repeatedly change prototypes during RNA replication by a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In the nutrient that acts as a mixing vessel, the tissue change occurs most often during CoV RNA transcription.
RNAs of very similar full length and subgenomic can recombine to produce new CoVs.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus - carrier interaction with regard to transmission
Besides the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutrient receptor is another important factor influencing intra - species transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis of the differentiators between human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is considered to be highly adaptive to various nutrients, particularly with mutations on the RBD of S protein.
Typically, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is selectively and intensely mediated by the nutrient immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment which binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral penetration.
SARS-CoV's RBD is able to identify ACE2 receptors from various animals including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing for intra-species transmission of viruses.
actually, only 6 amino acid residues were observed in RBD apart from human and civet viral isolates and 4 of them are located in receptor-bound nucleus for interaction with ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of Cvet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations which may increase the attraction of the spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be important in viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the binding similarity of its S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, cry-EM studies indicate a 10 to 20 times greater attraction of this linkage than the linkage between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptor would be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

They may also be responsible for successful adaptation of CoVs in humans following intra-species transmission from their animal nutrients.
The outcome of intra-species transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors, in addition to cellular receptors.
The variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and the natural co-parasites of HCoVs, such as bats, hummingbirds and mosquitoes, may hinder interspecies transmission.
Successful interspecies transmission of HCoVs requires tapping nutrient dependent factors and reversing nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus - nutrient interaction have yet to be identified and described.
Using the latest technology in CRISPR, non-biased genome-wide testing of nutrient dependence and inhibitory factors of SARS-CoV-2 may be fruitful.
The emergence of novel HCoVs: return to baseline
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as the gene codes for CoVs, HCoVs.

For example, novel protein-coding genes have the potential to greatly alter viral equivalents of acquisition or loss.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
SARS-CoVs are characterized by 29-nucleotide deletion in strains isolated at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 down into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that promotes cell transformation.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs lineages, with a very large number of small recombination regions identified in RNA-based RNA polymerases.
also identified recombination sites in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in hummingbirds in Saudi Arabia.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It should also be noted that artificial selection can cause unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly due to selection-pressure-free viruses, such as those produced by the innate immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to two-nucleotide deletion.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Last but not least, the progressive evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their host.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs which indicates inter-adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bates appeared to be structurally and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats, effectively reduce the pathogenicity generated by CoVs.
Additionally, inhibition of natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed by the regulation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression levels of the major tissue conformation complex class I molecules.
Furthermore, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the bat's excessive metabolic activity may suppress the replication of CoVs and affect the proof reading by exoribonucleases, thus providing selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus strains upon entry into the new nutrient.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, resulting in new proteins or protein characteristics for nutrient adaptation.
, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in rodents such as bats and camels.
without showing a strong immune response they replicate strongly.

Severe symptoms are mainly due to an immune response and overactivation of the cytokine storm, in which the more immune response occurs, the more severe lung damage is caused.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been isolated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of isolating the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reactions are particularly strong in bats.
, Administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
SARS-CoV-2 diffusion follows the same general theme as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Whereas bat beta-CoV has 95% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV, bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2.

Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found to be surprisingly similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate nutrients or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.

CoVs have come into focus due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our understanding of the germline of HCoVs in zoonotic origin and standard transmission.
The extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are native to bats and transmitted to humans via intermediate nutrients.
Considering that SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing civets there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, due to the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs very close to SARS-CoV-2, pangolin should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission.

MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been entering hummingbirds for several decades.

They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.

To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
n't we can kill these viruses, new gene variants may emerge to generate outbreaks.
Diverse zoogenic CoVs are circulating in wildlife.
In particular, bat CoVs with zoogenic potential are very diverse.
It is highly likely that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more infectious and/or deadly in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.

They remain in their natural habitat until there is no possibility of spreading.

Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients which will prove useful in preventing animal to human transmission and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is for humans to stay away from the natural ecological habitats of zoonotic viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing many pieces of the puzzle of its zoogenic origin.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to see within what conditions bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat.
Second,if bats play a direct role in human transmission,it must be determinedhow humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate nutrient then it should be clarified how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, as many mammals including domestic animals can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be done.

Continued investigation in this area will clarify the progressive evolution pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19.


In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest clinical criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" as per the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Edition) for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been an outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its publication, it has attracted considerable attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China has issued a total of seven editions with fundamental changes in some contexts in the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/).
Zhou et al. have now commented on our guidelines, they have proposed a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.

We support and thank them for their important work.
However, their work needs to be updated in line with the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Testing Edition VII) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), any one item of epidemiological history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis to confirm a suspected case, or three items of clinical manifestations if without a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) History of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) History of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (4) History of contact with a group of confirmed cases (fever ≥ 2 cases and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas such as homes, offices, schools, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte at early early stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with either one of the following items of pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) Real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is positive; (2) viral whole genome sequencing is showing high homology to known novel coronaviruses; (3) Serum testing is positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antigen and IgG antigen; or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antigen has a change from negative to positive, or the proportional gain is increased by ≥ 4 times compared to the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory system or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenicity of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serum evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These revisions were based on the ongoing work of researchers who are looking for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory system samples including blood samples, which increased the availability of various samples, and supporting the introduction of specific immune positive results into the confirmed criteria.

, Zhou et al. ' s flow chart should be updated, as they classify a person with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come forth and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest finding out and following the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update its guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh has recorded five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest one-day figure ever.
Bengladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in one day yesterday.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.


In an online news briefing, Dr Mirjadhi Sabrina Flora, Director of IEDCR, reported that four men and one woman have died.
According to Dr. Mirjadhi, two patients were over 60, two were between 51 and 60 and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also stated that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11th March.

The public transport shutdown started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
transportation of essential items such as medical supplies, fuel and food was not prohibited.
Bangladesh recorded the first cases of COVID-19 infection in two people and the wife of one of them who returned from Italy on 8th March.
On 19 March, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection cases across the world topped one million
Data from Johns Hopkins University show that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide crossed one million.
The coronavirus disease COVID-19 is being linked to at least 52 thousand deaths.

North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was among the few countries that are free from coronavirus infections yet.

The US has recorded over 2,444,000 cases of the coronavirus, and at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronavirus infection have occurred in the US on Wednesday.



The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the resolution passed by 215 votes, with ten members absent and one voting against.

Australia: Stores reduce the number of toilet paper they can buy at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper items that can be purchased at one time in all their stores nationwide to two and one packages respectively.
ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on the checkout sites and on the series' Facebook pages.
Shopping was reportedly being done in a situation where the shopper would need to self-isolate due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase limit of toilet paper to one pack per order for home delivery.


According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a huge surge in sales last week.
Canberra 's Costco store also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages to suppliers and also increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI raised stock to make the pre-planned Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers should try to increase their stock, but that this is made difficult by the restrictions imposed by the local council on the timing of truck deliveries.
In a situation where suppliers are trying to meet demand and the number of specials is reduced, Russell expects production costs to rise.

In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, reported that stores fill up stock every night.
Toilet paper is a heavy item, so there is no stock, and then, when all the stock is sold, the back shelves are empty, making the feeling of scarcity harder.
Russell Zimmerman, of Coles and Woolworths, said, "The idea is that if there were enough stuff on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitizer could be bought and available in large quantities, the chaos could probably be reduced".
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, reported last Wednesday that their stock had run out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a manufacturer of CLEANEX toilet tissue, and Solaris Paper, a manufacturer of sorbents, insisted that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.

The Thursday edition of the Darwin daily NT News had an eight - page insert that was cut and given to be used as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia dated March 3, the stores were initially reluctant to impose a ban; in this report they said that they had no plans to impose a ban on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman further stated that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, the limit of two packs of 12 rolls was also imposed on Sunday evening at the online British supermarket Okado.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.

Though the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent to which a disease spreads, not to the specific gravity of its cases, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to act.
All countries can change the course of this global pandemic now.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We are extremely concerned by both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Freeden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global pandemic is "unprecedented".
In comments published by CNN in February, he said that "no respiratory virus other than influenza has been detected through sustained global spread".
We have not seen a global pandemic caused by a coronavirus
And we have not seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.
This new designation of a global pandemic comes after the WHO decided in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "One thing is certain, it 's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and over 4,600 deaths as a result.
20Coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.

China has an estimated case mortality rate of 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can be as long as two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primarily treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for those who are suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has created severe global socio-economic disruption, prompting the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the panicked shopping by people has led to widespread supply shortages.
193 countries have schools and universities closed on a nationwide or local basis, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world student population.



Most cases were linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is considered to be of animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known individual with symptoms was later found to be ill on December 1, 2019, and the individual had no visible connections to the Wallace Meat Market group.
Two-thirds of the initial batch of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post reported that a case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on 17 November 2019, which may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that with a drop in new cases in China, there was a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Case reports may be low, especially in people with mild symptoms.

Cases refers to the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and who have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.

A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had gone undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The original estimate of the basal reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people who are infected with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 has caused the deaths of approximately 97,000 people.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official death tally from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to those who died tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as this may not include people dying without testing such as in a home, nursing home, etc.
Italy has partial data that shows that the additional death toll during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
"We know that [the alleged death toll] has been underestimated", a CDC spokesperson admitted, a statement supported by descriptive reports of a low count in the US. Such underestimations occur frequently in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.


These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The death-case ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies by area.
In China, the estimated death-case ratio has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning by 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed as dying from a disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) as dying from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.

The University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for an overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this threshold is consistent with the results of the first randomized test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of an outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"If left unchecked, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and begin to decline when nutrients are no longer available for the disease", says Mackie Bonney, Penn State University.
"
Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could be over by June" if all countries follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucherski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 is "likely to remain circulating for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly: 18 months or more).
"I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will be completely eradicated, because it's very easily transmitted","and it could turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University.
The severity of the return will depend on the extent of the group immunity and mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively nonspecific and infected individuals may be allergenic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cough), reduced sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, hemorrhaging, diarrhea or bronchitis. According to WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluing of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised when these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected may be allergenic, with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm infection, so researchers have advised that people in close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the anti - allergenic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty is the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell, which was initially 30% and later decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is thought to be spread mainly by small droplets produced during close contact and coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have shown that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to go from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets produced during speaking that remain in the air for longer. Breathing droplets can also be produced during exhalation, including while speaking, although the virus is not normally aerogenic.
The droplets can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly into the lungs by breath.
Certain medical procedures such as tubal penetration and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) may cause respiratory secretion to be delayed and thus airborne transmission.
It can also be spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth.

The Chinese government has dismissed the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages of the disease.

Only a few reports of laboratory confirmed allergenic cases exist, but allergenic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three other people. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for four hours.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing your hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from household soap, which decomposes its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to two bat-derived strains of the betacoronavirus subgenus serbecovirus (genus B).
It is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only a single amino acid difference in parts of genome sequences between pangolins from viruses and viruses from humans.
In whole genome comparison so far, the common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be up to 92% which is insufficient to validate the intermediate nutrient to pangolins.

A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specific with many of its image characteristics being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CTs should not be used as a primary test to test for or diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published a number of RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on breath or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
The test is usually performed on the nasopharynx, but a throat swab can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect immunity.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Symptomatic people on radiograph and computed tomography (CT) have asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pulmonary secretions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Because of similarities with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19, without confirmation by PCR.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that although imaging is less specific to infection, it is sharper and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based twisted neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
To prevent transmission, strategies include, maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and dumping that tissue directly in the garbage bin.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.

This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community are unaware of where and how they became infected. Care providers caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.

Users receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are spreading about methods of preventing infection; for example, rubbing the nose and grinding with a mouthwash are not effective.
No COVID-19 vaccine is available, although several organisations are working to develop a vaccine.
To prevent transmission of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty; before eating; and after splashing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.
Additionally, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
71% ethanol,50100% isopropanol,0.1% sodium hypochlorite,0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and0.27.5% povidone-iodine. Surfaces can be disinfected with several solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant to a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed COVID case at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons, etc., should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a cloth or a cloth when coughing or sneezing and then dispose of any cloth immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing masks may limit the amount of breathing droplets and distance traveled when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing masks can reduce the tendency for people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene". Masks are also recommended to be used by people who are caring for someone who has the disease.
WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of face masks by ordinary individuals.
In the US, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by normal healthy people, especially when they come into close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16th March, Vietnam has requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all persons entering the grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when going to public areas.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses from 1 April.
Panama has made wearing a face mask while going out mandatory, while also making a homemade face mask for those who cannot afford a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.

The methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now making social distancing mandatory or recommended in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum crowd recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was reduced rapidly from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in an area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public mass gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and weakened immune system are at higher risk for serious illness and complications and are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks. In late March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to make it clear that the purpose of social contact is to reduce physical contact while maintaining either virtual or remote.
The use of the term "social distancing" has implications that people should adopt complete social distancing rather than being encouraged to stay in contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, who has no virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine directives have been issued for the high risk groups.
Individuals who may have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and individuals who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment, or suppression, and mitigation.
Containment is performed in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to detect infected people as well as implement other infection control measures and vaccination to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to stop the spread of disease, efforts move to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Both containment and mitigation measures can be combined simultaneously.
More extreme measures are needed for suppression, so as to reverse the epidemic by reducing the baseline reproduction number to less than 1. Part of managing an outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services being overwhelmed and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that can manage the outbreak include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks and self-quarantine; intentional community measures such as physical distancing, closing schools and cancelling mass gathering programs; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleanliness.Tougher actions aimed at containment of the outbreak were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as imposing city-wide quarantine restrictions and strict travel restrictions.
Other countries also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to infected people who self quarantined and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and penalized stockpiling of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the US show that there are major challenges in mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic).
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce extreme health care demand by two thirds and deaths by half, but they still kill hundreds and severely damage health systems.
Suppression can be prioritized, but needs to be maintained until the virus is spreading in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if earlier), otherwise loosening in measures will return to rapid transmission.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including trials of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.

According to WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" may relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.

ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at multiple levels, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, canceling selective procedures wherever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capacities and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available through staff training.
There are many opinions about where the first case (so - called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
They were mostly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of zoogenetic origin. The pneumonia group with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was treated by Zhang Jixian, a physician at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported it to the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.

The police warned eight doctors including Li Wenliang for spreading false rumors and another doctor, I Feng, was reprimanded by his superiors.
Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
Wuhan had reported a significant number of cases of unknown pneumonia to health authorities, resulting in investigations starting in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.





National responses include containment measures such as quarantines (known as stay at home orders, shelter in your own place orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the US or nearly 90% of the population are in some form of lockdown, over 50 million people are in lockdowns in the Philippines, approximately 59 million people are in lockdowns in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are in lockdowns in India.

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case occurred on 17 November.
Zheng Jixian, a physician, observed a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
Preliminary genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.

WHO was informed on the same day.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
China National Health Commission had initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.

The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshensen Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
To handle additional patients, another hospital, the Leichensens Hospital, was later built.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau set up a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were set up in many Chinese areas.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.

Beijing, for example, has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case had been transmitted domestically in the last five days in mainland China, in this instance via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic incentive packages for businesses. The State Council declared a day of mourning, beginning at 10:00 am on 4 April, with a three-minute national silence, timed to coincide with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online while observing physical distancing to avoid new COVID-19 outbreaks.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China on 20 January 2020.
The nation's health agency recorded a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely related to the crowding in the Daiga of a new religious movement known as the Shinchionji Church of Jesus.
Shichengji Bhakti, who came to Daigu from Wuhan, was suspected of being the origin of the outbreak.


All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The programme introduced by South Korea was considered the largest and best organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus and isolate any infected people as well as to track down and quarantine those who came into contact with them.

South Korea's program is considered a breakthrough in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, claiming mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or praised her response.

On 29th March, it was informed that all new foreign arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks from 1st April.

Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Initial measures announced by the government included closing of concerts and other cultural events, sports events, and Friday prayers, and closing of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26th February 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak and only individuals would be quarantined.


Amidst claims to cover up the extent of the outbreak in Iran, over ten countries found their cases linked to Iran as of February 28, indicating that the extent of the outbreak may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian parliament was shut down on 3 March, when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus.

It stated that closed institutions such as quarantine centres are at higher risk of spreading the virus, which also lacks adequate medical care.



According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases than are being reported in Iran.
It has also been suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may have affected the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed in Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
The cases started to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.

" In the outbreak zones, entry and exit will not be provided", Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said.

All major sporting events including Serie A football matches were to be held without spectators by April, but on 9 March, all games were postponed altogether for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all business activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding protocols for the screening of serious patients, which can be employed.



A CNN report suggested that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test people who had the virus by then may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
UK response to the virus initially emerged as the most lax of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to concerns faced by the public.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced strict social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and limiting outdoor activity to what is considered essential.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through fines and crowd dispersal.
Most businesses were ordered to close except for those deemed "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in a person in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington who had returned from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was established on 29 January.


Despite doing so, the US got off to a slow start in testing, making it difficult to understand the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
Trials were hampered by defective test kits manufactured by the federal government in February, lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academics, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria (which required a doctor's order afterwards) for people to qualify for a test by the beginning of March.
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been performed in the US.

On March 22, The Associated Press reported: "Many people with symptoms and who have a doctor's order have waited hours or days for a test". In the United States, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency following the first death reported in Washington state on February 29, an action that was soon followed by other states.
Seattle area schools canceled classes on March 3 and by mid-March, schools across the country were being closed.

InterXon informed that the Chinese government donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6, when Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.

Japan donated one million face masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia sent over 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia announced donating 18 million medical gloves to China, Germany provided various medical supplies including 10,000 Hazmat suits, and the US donated 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China and pledged $100 million in additional financial assistance to affected countries. After cases in China appeared to be stable, the country is sending aid to various countries affected by the pandemic.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to Italy to help deal with its coronavirus outbreak.
Jack Ma, a businessman, sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia for distribution by the African Union.
He later sent to Panama 5,000 testing kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 ventilators.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and Czech Republic expressed their concerns over Chinese-made masks and testing kits.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits with an accuracy rate of just 30%, meanwhile, the Netherlands recalled 600,000 Chinese face masks that were defective.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unused masks, which were thought to have come from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency aid operations for developing countries.
WHO has commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containment of the pandemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where the Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government has "provided regular updates to avoid fear ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays".
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Gallia commented that while "definitely not recommended by WHO" this was "a very important sign of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in public health history". On January 30, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission and an increase in the number of other cases outside China, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth since the PHEIC was first measured during the 2009 flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was caused by "risk of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries without strong health systems.


Tedros further declared in statements that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later".On February 11, WHO set up a press conference to name the disease as COVID-19.

As a result, a UN Crisis Management Team was activated, which coordinated the response across the UN, which according to WHO will enable them to "focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to bear the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak".
On February 14, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was activated to provide ground realities to international and WHO experts in China, to assist in domestic management and to visit the region to assess "the severity and contagiousness of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions and to assess "the impact of response activities at provincial and county levels, including urban and rural arrangements". On February 25, WHO announced that "the world should make more efforts to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", saying that although it would be too early to say yet, countries should remain in a "stage of preparedness".

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergency Programme, warned in a statement that "this is a reality check for every government on earth: it's time to wake up.
This virus may be coming its way and you need to be prepared", urging that the right response measures can help the world avoid "its worst".
Ryan further stated that current data has not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially accepting that every human being on Earth will be exposed to that virus".

The WHO was "deeply concerned by both the dangerous level of spread and severity and the dangerous level of inaction". The WHO has faced major criticism as inadequate management of the pandemic, including delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
The recall included a petition for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.

The expert group said that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that this responsibility is the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that everyone, including people with disabilities, minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, people living in extreme poverty, people living in isolation, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government assistance, has the right to health.
International governmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information, perspectives and advice on policy responses in countries around the world.
From policies to strengthening health systems and from the global economy to addressing the impacts of travel curbs and restrictions, the Digital Hub includes a Country Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the pandemic that started in the Chinese province of Hubei by the US, the UK Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro.
Several provincial level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that the move was aimed at saving Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.

The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China's "control system has turned a virus into a global pandemic now", which some critics have seen as distracting from racism and "the failure of his administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast received a US government cable outlining a communications standoff with apparent origins in the National Security Council, quoting the strategy as "everything is about China.
We are being asked to try to send this message in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. Outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus is part of propaganda to increase global influence.
Josep Borrell,European Union's foreign policy chief, warned that there is a "geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through change and 'the politics of liberalism'".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with the latter two countries reportedly receiving aid.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid intended for other nations to their own country.
And there have been mask-related disputes between countries like Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.

Italy's ambassador to the EU Maurizio Massari said that "only China reacted bilaterally.
"Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity".

Italian newspaper La Stampa, citing an unnamed "high-level political source", said that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of "geopolitical and diplomatic" flattery.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Meo have refuted the media reports and expressed their gratitude.

The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical devices due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Fear-driven shopping was also seen in many areas, leading to shortages of grocery essentials like food, toilet paper, and bottled water from shelves, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warned about delays in the transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a twentyfold increase in normal prices and a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It has led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, which WHO has warned will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for daigo shoppers to sell Australian products in China.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and for detecting the immunity produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immunology can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Immunotherapy tests show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
The results of this test can be used to determine the exact mortality rate and the level of collective immunity in the population.


This disparity is also likely to significantly affect the reported case mortality rate, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiratory samples obtained by various methods including nasogastric faeces or mucus samples can be tested.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with throat loops is reliable in the first week of disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat, while continuing to grow in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively, sample material can then be taken from the airway from the inside by suction catheter or coughing material (bulgums) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in January 2020 at Charité in Berlin, and formed the basis for the delivery of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test kit by 23 January 2020. South Korean company KoganBiotech developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (Powercheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene found in SARS-CoV-2 in particular. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 screening kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories via International Reagent Resources.
Older versions of the test kit yielded inconclusive results due to defective reagents in one of the three genetic tests, and caused problems with testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day for the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and state and local laboratories were not allowed to initiate testing until then.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization. US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
As of 5th March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing across the country.
Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country as of 9th March 2020.
No quantity limits were announced; collection and processing of samples should be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was notified of developing a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a high volume test that can be performed within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 tests being performed over a 24-hour period from a single machine.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Holological, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.

FDA has approved a test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in less than 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.

A March 2020 literature review concluded that early stage chest radiography has little clinical significance, whereas CT [computed tomography] results may be available even before symptom onset.
The characteristic features of CT include bilateral multilob ground - glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the subplural effect, crazy pewing and consolidation develops.
The study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the source of the current epidemic, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less specific, with many of the imaging characteristics being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used as a screening or first line screening for the diagnosis of COVID-19. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary screening.
The immune response to infection is part of the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to determine immunity starting in individuals 7 days or so after onset of symptoms and to detect infection for monitoring of people. Testing can be done in Central Laboratories (CLT) or by Point-of-Care Testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many diagnostic laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
CLT is usually performed using a single sample of peripheral blood, although a series of samples can be used to see the immune response.
PoCT is usually performed by taking a single sample of blood from a skin puncture.
The FDA designated 29 units on 26 March 2020 that provided information to the agency as needed and thus are now able to distribute their own immunoassays.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under Emergency Use Authorization.

Immunizers can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, UK found that none of the immunization testing kits they had purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong plans to allow suspected patients to stay at home,Emergency Department will provide the patient with a sample tube, they will spit in it and return it and get the test results soon.The British NHS announced that they are launching a scheme to screen suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to hospital or the risk of disinfecting the used ambulance.In the drive-through screening of suspected cases of COVID-19, professional health professionals take samples with due care.
Drive-through testing centers have helped South Korea perform the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the capacity to perform about 12,000 tests per day in an ambulatory setting and performed 10,700 tests in the past week.
When the test is ordered by the doctor, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Drive-through checks offered in several major cities till 19th March.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany is unknown, as only positive results have been reported.
The first laboratory survey found that by week 12/2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples were tested and 33,491 (6.9%) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion & Rembrandt Hospital developed and tested a method to simultaneously test samples from 64 patients by combining samples and, if the combined sample is found to be positive, further testing. In Wuhan, a 2,000-meter temporary emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) by BGI was launched on February 5, 2020, which can process more than 10,000 samples in a single day.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Wuhan Laboratory has been immediately followed by Hua-Yen Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Asse has released multicenter open source frameworks that can test up to 1122 samples of COVID19 patients using 93 tests. These balanced frameworks can be run in small labs without the need for robotic liquid handlers.

This prompted some authors to explore sampling protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free up the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for coronavirus per capita than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to reach a larger population.
This was due to a combination of drive-through testing capability and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency testing labs in China).

The WHO adopted and sent the German method for developing kits for low-income countries lacking resources.
Germany method published on 17 January 2020; protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. At the start of the outbreak, there were problems between China and the United States over the reliability of test kits and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of testing by health experts.

Testing capability, particularly in private sector laboratories, developed by the South Korean Government over the course of several years.
World Health Organization on 16 March said that increasing testing programs is the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to thousands of outstanding tests being piled up in private U.S. labs and the supply of reagents and chemicals becoming strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues in its testing kits.
In the United States, there was a shortage of testing kits developed by the CDC; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private testing. Spain purchased testing kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioegy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm noted that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the false testing kits and replace them with the second testing kits made available by Shenzhen Biog. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million testing kits from China, which were not found to be accurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they should be dumped in the Danube. Ateş Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a high error rate and they did not use them. UK, which purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, declared that they were not usable.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Total, about half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the people with detected cases were quarantined.
Travel restrictions at the point of entry and exit completely eliminated new infections.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea have also managed the pandemic aggressively by contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistics show that countries with more tests than deaths have a much lower case mortality, possibly because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
out of 16 reference labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
In the chart below, the column of % of positive tests is affected by the testing policy of the country.
As with other things, a country where only those who are hospitalized are tested, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than a country where all citizens are tested, whether they show symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands with the aim of removing dirt, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.

Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child using the toilet.
After you blow your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste.

Washing hands before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals from hands that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important activity for the general public.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

A 2013 study found that good hand washing practices in children under five years old may slightly improve their height gain.
In developing countries, simple behavioural changes, such as starting to wash hands with soap, can reduce infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.

48% of the reduction in cases of diarrhoea can be attributed to hand washing with soap. As a self-imposed behavior in homes, schools and communities worldwide, hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
A major ARI, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under five years old, with an estimated 18 million children dying each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of about 35 lakh children annually.
UNICEF says making a strong habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or treatment, reducing the number of deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
A minor side effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can cause skin damage due to dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, layered skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive - compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the fecal transmission of disease: after using the toilet (urine immersion, defecation), after cleaning the baby's nipples (after changing the diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or consuming raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when proper hand washing technique should be practiced to prevent transmission of disease are: before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or spraying your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 handwashing study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households adopted the practice of handwashing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%, with the US the moderate rate at 77%, and China the lowest rate at 23%. There are now many behavioral modification methods available to enhance handwashing behavior with soap at critical times. Mass handwashing by schoolchildren at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large scale action to promote the health and education of children.
The basic principles of this national programme include daily fluoride cleaning, daily hand washing with soap, and anti - worm treatment twice a year.

The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be improved by mixing soap or detergent in water.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to the solution, and increase the solubility.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
However, adequate water flow helps in cleaning.
Solid soap may contain residual bacteria from previous uses due to repeated use.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transfer is unlikely due to the washing of bacteria with foam.
"Soap with a liquid soap drop on the palms without touching the hands is better", says the CDC.
The emphasis has been placed on antibacterial soaps for the health conscious public.

Antibacterial soaps, however, contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In addition to moisturizers and skin protecting agents, refined formulations may include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acid, and other skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that plain soap, containing triclosan, is as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as consumer-grade soaps.
Hot water is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
At body temperature (37 ° C) bacteria grow very rapidly.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a waterless base hand sanitizer.

Most of these isopropyls are based on alcohol or ethanol, which are formulated with glycerin in a gel, such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid), or in a liquid or foam, such as a moisturizer, for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The combination of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing 60 to 95% alcohol are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol rub sanitizer destroys bacteria, multi - drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and the vectors.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% bacteria within 30 seconds of application (equivalent to 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) and kill 99.99% to 99.999% bacteria within 1 minute of application (equivalent to 4 to 5 log reduction). Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and least effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norvac) type viruses which are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol rub should be used to wet or cover both hands completely.
Rub the front and back of both hands and the middle and the fingertips of all fingers for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing them in both palms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when hands appear dirty.
The increased use of these reagents is based on their ease of use and quick lethal activity towards microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/ or other lubricants to the formula.
In clinical trials, lubricated alcohol-based hand sanitizer significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antimicrobial deodorants.
Alcohol or contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity are rare allergies to the additives present in alcohol hand rubs.
The lower tendency to induce irritating contact dermatitis than washing hands with soap and water became a draw.

That's why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, because pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce effectiveness after repeated use due to possibly progressive adverse skin reactions, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application.

Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase rather than reduce the spread of disease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap, when soap is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for preventing the transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because standing water basins can be contaminated, although the water temperature does not matter.
Make a mould of the appropriate amount of soap on the hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap rather than water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer releases more germs.
Wash well under running water.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Dry with a clean towel or let it air dry.
Wet and damp hands are more easily re-contaminated. The most frequently missed areas are the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers and the area under the nails.
Nails and sticky nail polishes can provide shelter to microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low cost options can be created to facilitate hand washing, e.g. pouring water from a hanging basin or a spigot with suitable holes and/or using ash. In situations of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water conservation solutions are available, such as "tippy-tap" and other low cost options.
Tippi - tap is a simple technique that uses a rope - hanging jug, and a leg - operated lever, to pour a small amount of water over the hands and soapstick.
Efficient hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Research shows that paper towels are more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the Paper Towel Industry The European Tissue Symposium, which aimed to compare the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
After washing hands and drying with hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased on average 194% on the palms of the fingers and 254% on the palms of the hands.
Drying with a jet - air dryer increased the total number of bacteria on average by 42% on the palms of the fingers and by 15% on the palms of the hands.
After washing hands and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on the palms of the fingers and 77% on the palms of the hands. The scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying resulted in the ability to cross-contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which drains air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms from the hands and unit and possibly contaminate the toilet environment up to 2 meters away and other toilet users.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread microorganisms up to 0. 25 m from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the count of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
In the absence of soap and water during the journey, hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes is an option.
Alcohol - based hand sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol.
Long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in preventing disease in the hospital environment (in 1846), medical hand washing became mandatory.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that their use reduced the infection rate.
Therapeutically, hands are washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, with a moulding using an appropriate amount of soap and water or gel and rubbing each part of the hands.
Both hands should be rubbed with fingers.
If there is debris under the nails, a stiff hair brush can be used to remove it.
As germs can stay in water on hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit doors should be opened if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being re - contaminated with those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health care system is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent them from being transmitted.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in most medical settings, non-washing remains unacceptable, with large numbers of doctors and nurses neglecting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, which leads to the transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections by up to 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in healthcare settings.
The hand hygiene manual available from this organisation can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was made by Witby et al.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has identified "five occasions" for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/body fluid
Before the disinfection, and
After patient care. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap (medicinal or "antibacterial" soap) gives the hand washing agent a killing power.

All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing the wrists from the hands to the elbows for 2 - 6 minutes.
No need to rub for long (10 minutes)
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand hygiene came from 20% before washing, and little additional benefit was obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene was increased by more than 35%.

Further research is needed to determine which of these measures are most effective in various health care systems.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered to be an affordable, essential means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces poses a challenge to achieve universal hand washing practices.
For example, in most rural Africa, every private or public toilet has very few hand washing faucets, even though there are cheap alternatives to build hand washing stations.
However, the low rate of hand washing may be due to the habit rather than the lack of soap or water.
The promotion and support of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and bring about long-term behavioural changes in the population.
To function effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, whereas social outreach campaigns are less effective. An example for handwashing promotion in schools is the "Three Star Method" by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap alongside other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars respectively.
The creation of hand washing stations may be a part of hand washing promotion campaigns which are done to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness raising campaign aimed at trying to bring about a change in behaviour.
Some studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries with regard to prevention of DALYs.

The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two promoters of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, English who is "the founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by a bad smell called miasmus.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively increase hand hygiene as a critical method to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "the right hand washing techniques" were hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase "wash your hands of something" means to declare your unwillingness to accept responsibility for or participation in it.


It has also been found that people wash their hands more often than others, after recalling or contemplating immoral acts, and attach more importance to hand washing devices.


️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, washing hands is mandatory before and after every meal.
Control of risks of spreading COVID-19 infection in the workplace

The appropriate control of the risk of disease spread in the workplace depends on the workplace and the work being done, which is based on risk assessments of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual personnel who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact work involves minimal workplace contact with people and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: hand washing, encouraging personnel to stay home if they are sick, observing respiratory etiquette, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Moderate contact risk jobs are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 infection, but who may have become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes personnel who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population density working environments, and some high volume sales arrangements.
Besides basic infection prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include: high efficiency air filter ventilation, use of sneez guards, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for the situation if a COVID-19 infected person is encountered.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and mortuary workers to be at high exposure risk who come into contact with a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk becomes increased to a high exposure risk if personnel perform procedures that generate aerosols on, or collect or handle samples from, a COVID-19 infected or suspected person.
The appropriate hazard controls for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers and work-appropriate personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have multiple impacts within the workplace.

The nature of trade can change, both in terms of what goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as at times of low demand or purchasing through delivery or mobile services).
Finally, movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparedness and response planning for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and job functions, including sources of risk, risk factors arising from home and community arrangements, and risk factors of individual personnel such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address the risks and contingency plans for the circumstances that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Prepare and respond to infectious disease plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of an outbreak response include: reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease affects the responses adopted in the community where the business is located.
Sequencing of hazard controls is a structure widely used to group hazard controls according to their effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work related hazards without depending on personnel behaviour, and this may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain contacts.
All types of PPE should be selected for personnel based on hazard, appropriately fitted (e.g., respirators), worn consistently and properly, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact hazard jobs have minimal business contact with people and other coworkers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: washing hands frequently and thoroughly, encouraging staff to stay home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquette covering cough and sneezing, tissue and garbage disposal, preparing remote or parallel shifting if necessary, discouraging staff from using other people's tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Early identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons in the workplace is an important step towards protecting personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home as long as they are free from fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medications, and that flexible leave policies allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate contact risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to be COVID-19 infected, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission occurring around the workplace, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include staff who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density working environments, and some high volume sales arrangements. Installing high efficiency air filters in engineering controls for this and high risk groups, increasing the transmission rate, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing guards, and installing drive-through windows for customer service. Installing sick staff in administrative controls for this and high risk groups, changing face-to-face meetings to virtual communications, establishing parallel contact points, preventing unnecessary travel to locations where customers are running COVID-19, developing emergency plans, including: providing staff with access to safety measures for the use of face washing masks, providing staff with training on COVID-19 and other ways to reduce the risk of using hands, face masks, and other tools that may reduce the need for access to safe and sanitary workplaces, and providing staff with access to the latest training and safety tools, including hands-on training and access to the latest COVID-19 safety devices, hands-on training and other forms of communication that may reduce the risk of working with COVID-19.
This risk group rarely requires the use of respirators.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, appropriate controls for the safety of crew and other passengers include: keeping the sick person 6 feet away from others, designating a crew member to serve the sick person, and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue if coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, potentially additional personal protective equipment should be worn.
Gloves and other consumables should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial shipping including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard controls include postponing travel if sick and self-isolation and immediately notifying the onboard medical center if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the isolate individual's room. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if an infected individual has been in a school building that is free of community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling meals at field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, paralleling arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is sufficient transmission in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. For law enforcement personnel performing daily law enforcement activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
if there is close contact during the catch, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment, using household cleaning sprays or wipes, before reuse, and follow standard operating procedures for the sealing and disposal of used PPE and for the sealing and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health care and mortuary workers to be in high or very high exposure risk categories.

These become very high exposure risk if personnel perform aerosol generating procedures, collect samples from or handle patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Aerosol generating procedures include tubal penetration, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or sample collection from a tear.
High-contact-risk morgue tasks involve people preparing the bodies of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if they do autopsy, they become very high-contact-risk.Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including during procedures that generate aerosols.
In some health care and mortuary settings, specific negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in separate waiting zones, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case. Besides other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who operate within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the US, NIOSH approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entry point.
For those collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles face shield, shongs and gloves.
If an aerosol generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Considering that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only PPE needed for specific function, using the same respirator without removing it during care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for non-diagnostic individuals.

This month, we are surrounded by extraordinary circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that all humans are interconnected and that we have responsibilities towards each other.
The challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must recognize that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community building, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of camaraderie we've seen amongst all our colleagues over emails, calls and chats is an extraordinary testament to the many extraordinary people we've had the privilege of working with.
I am so grateful and proud to have all of you as colleagues that I cannot express in words.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
It reminded me how meaningful it is to turn the world to Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful a symbol it is to keep this vital resource online and available to everyone.
It's your work that makes this possible, whether you're keeping the sites running or you're a source of pay for our colleagues or you're keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information from Wikipedia, and it needs it now more than ever.
This is a moment where both what we do, and how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work with you this coming week.
Changes in our work and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our methodology and to prepare a timetable for the days and months ahead.
In that conversation, we thought about the appropriate response we thought would be appropriate to the situation we were facing, and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve the tension and support our mission for the long term.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
To all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be approximately 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work overtime, the mission needs your help.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're not counting your time.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You don't have to say it, but we are saying it.
No sick leave or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work are seen by everyone.
(️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Hourly workers will get full pay.
We have said it before, and we are once again expressing our commitment to delivering on our promises to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will get paid on the basis of his normal working hours during normal conditions.
You will get paid even if you are sick and cannot work.
if you want to work, we're with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get out of the stress of the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfying, especially at times like this.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We suggest that you talk to your manager, so that we know what to expect, and then we can adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we can't let stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising Teams (and others) perform critical tasks that may require additional collaboration.
To assess our current objectives and focus our attention on collaborating on the things that are essential to our mission, we will start a process with all departments.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You will no longer be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that have gone beyond reality.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What about APP?
To accommodate our new reality and the expectations of daily working hours, we want to adjust the timeline for completing our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension to our 2019-2020 plan that will allow us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their critical work, care for themselves, care for loved ones, and those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule can be accommodated for the next few weeks.
This extension of deadlines will bring a significant reduction in our current planning workload and pressure throughout the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Board of Directors next week and as soon as we get confirmation we will inform the representatives and teams about the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership.
                         
Last week we learned that a colleague of ours from SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, taking great care, we deployed antiviral cleaning staff to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
He disinfected every surface with a hospital-grade anti-viral solution, the lobby, and the elevator bank that goes up to our floor.
The building is implementing its own care-duty protocol using products that assist the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that when we return, the office will be fully equipped.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office had adopted a completely remote system in line with the guidance shared from San Francisco.
As some of our NYC colleagues know, there is also talk of leasing a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely from home for the first time.
Our longtime colleagues who work from home/remote know that this will require adjustment and they would like to give you some advice:
Limit meeting time to one or two hour increments at most.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them into several days.
Defining meetings clearly, having agendas ready, and sending reading materials in advance.
Make video your default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and collaboration.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Use your health reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
HR Operations Team is exploring webinar-based work efficiency guidance to support the increased work delivered across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community-funded subscribers to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events like Editathon etc. until WHO announces the end of the global pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions might make it impossible to complete their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for being forced to delay or amend those targets.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance regarding Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.

Going forward, CRT is working to organize a page on Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a place for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintain contact about COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are together in these situations and are here to help in any way we can.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Catherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Jenine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme associated with the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by decreasing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin - modifying enzyme 2 is a zinc - containing metaloenzyme found on the interstitial and other cell surfaces.
ACE2 protein consists of the N - terminal peptide M2 domain and the C - terminal electrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein with an unfolded enzyme-active domain on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 's extracellular domain is degraded by another enzyme called shadase from the parathyroid domain, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membrane of lung type II airborne cells, enterocytes of small intestine, interstitial cells of arteries and veins and the soft muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
ACE2 ' s primary function is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE breaks down angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II, which is a vasodilator.
ACE2 then breaks down the carboxyl - terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp - Arg - Val - Tyr - Ile - His - Pro - Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1 - 7), (H - Asp - Arg - Tyr - Ile - His - Pro - OH).
ACE2 [des-Arg9] - can also break down many other peptides including bradycainin, epelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been shown to play a role in coronary heart disease.
As a parasitic protein, it serves as the main entry point into cells for certain coronaviruses, including ACE2, HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-causing virus).
More specifically, binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2's contak S1 protein to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytosis and transfer of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the activation of the S protein by the nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapy.
However, many professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
The methodological review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia of 34% compared to controls".
"The risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially in those with trauma and heart failure.
"Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less pronounced than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Reacombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
In humans, the half - life of rhACE2 is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour cycle of action.

COVID-19 Apps are mobile software applications created to assist in contact tracing, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person, in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.


Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly about systems that are based on tracking the geolocation of app users.


In China, the Chinese government has deployed an app in conjunction with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.


Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed several potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and potential lack of effectiveness if the app is used by only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple determined what type of organizations could include coronavirus related apps in its App Store, limiting them to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly about whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions on government projects:
monitoring must be 'legitimate, necessary and proportionate';
There should be a closing clause for supervision and monitoring extensions;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and shown to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid promoting discrimination and disenfranchisement;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens to abuse and to respond to abuse;
"Meaningful participation" by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and unauthorized groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohn Gränegen) (RSF) have also released checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use central servers for interpersonal communication (see section below).
A non-app based system was used to do contact tracing in South Korea.
Rather than using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Several countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, these details have not yet been released.
Privacy-protection contact tracing is a well-established concept with a large body of research literature dating back to at least 2013.
PEPP-PT is a coordination effort involving both centralized and decentralized methods, and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-protection proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly contact event numbers, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all matches are on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protection technologies when collecting and using location or path intersection data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.

SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.



He also published the specifications of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be made available in three stages:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protecting coronavirus tracing apps.

Drug reuse (also known as drug reuse, reprofiling, re-assignment, or therapeutic change) is the reuse of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directives include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma injections related to health benefits. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides a proper project for developing effective antiviral drugs for protection from COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are the papane-like protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain et al. studied several candidate compounds, which then adapted and analyzed for their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in a pre-clinical study recommended in a clinical study structure.

In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half the patients received favipiravir and half received omifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is very limited and preliminary.

According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of the antiviral lopinavir and a combination of ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir (Caletra), concluded that "no benefit was seen".
The drugs were designed to bind proteases to prevent HIV from replicating.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism within the scientific community about redirecting resources towards the re-purpose of drugs being developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Trial.
Remdecivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdecivir had artificial peripheral antiviral activation for protection against several phyllo-, pneumo-, paramexo - and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations which can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary preclinical studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.

A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine for protection against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).


Five vaccine candidates were in Phase 1 safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

As stated in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large scale planning and global availability.
In April, CEPI scientists informed that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the launch of 2020 to create an effective vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (according to the Milken Institute 79), and 37 others have been announced, but little public information is available (are being designed or envisaged in planning).
A phase I - II trial involves initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually conducted at random, placebo - controlled and multiple sites, setting a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials generally involve more participants, including a control group monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose, and testing for vaccine efficacy for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).

CEPI has also been partnered by Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland for the development of COVID-19 vaccines.

Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-enhanced RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.



On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies for protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities, in conjunction with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, pooled resources for the acquisition of supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have asymmetrical effects, also called non - specific effects.

Another randomized trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to enlist.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Preliminary research assessing vaccine effectiveness using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for biosecurity level 3 containment measures to deal with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection against SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection from MERS.

As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two are adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy, claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days but can be as long as two to fourteen days.
Though in most cases symptoms are mild, in some cases viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop.
As of 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread mainly between people during close contact, often through small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Though these droplets are produced when exhaling, they usually fall on the ground or surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.

The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasogastric swab.
It is recommended that masks be worn by people who suspect they are infected with the virus and by their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending their non-use, some recommending their use, and others making their use mandatory.



Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up and bluing of the face or lips; seeking immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases in China, only chest tightness and rapid beating were observed at first.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the period of awakening.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be as long as two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.

The proportion of people infected who do not exhibit symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained allergenic during their stay in hospital.
China's National Health Commission began including allergenic cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of 166 infections that day were allergenic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva may contain large amounts of viral material.
Talk out loud makes more drops than talk in the normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cough can produce droplets up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).

Certain medical procedures such as tubal penetration and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to produce aerosols and thus cause airborne transmission.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three other people. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was detectable on cardboard for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on 99% copper for four hours.

Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products inactivate viruses by breaking down the fatty protective layer, as well as freeing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken an average of two days after the start of hospital admission.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral content, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral content on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.

The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 as the virus reaches the nutrient cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the lung type II air-cellular cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "contact" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of those hospitalized with acute cardiac damage in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to the body' s inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.

Although SARS-COV-2 has a trace for the respiratory tract's ACE2-expressing epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to be correlated with selection of donor IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic foreign matter has also been reported in autopsy.
WHO has published a number of testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by the nasopharynx of a nasopharynx; however, a nasal nasal or mucous sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples to be taken two weeks apart and the immediate value of the results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person was previously infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that purity is only 60 to 70%.
In the US, the FDA approved the first-care-of-site trial on 21 March 2020 for use later that month. Clinical guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University outlined methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
In the initial transition, bilateral polygonal ground - glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common.
As the disease progresses, subplural dominance, crazy paving (thickening of the walls of the pelvis with variable airflow), and condensation may appear.
We have limited data on microscopic lesions and pathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings from autopsy are:
Makroscopy: Pneumonia, pericarditis, pulmonary densification and pulmonary shock in the pulmonary envelope
Viral pneumonia can be seen in four types of severity:
Mild pneumonia: Pulmonary thrombosis, pneumocytosis, large disproportionate pneumocytes, interpupillary inflammation with lymphocytic interpolation and multicentric giant cell formation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
DAD is the cause of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: Management of leaks and pulmonary space fibrillation in the air cavities
Blood: diffuse interventricular scaling (DIC); leukoarythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
CDC has recommended the use of face coverings in public settings to limit transmission by immunocompromised individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce exposure of infected individuals to large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty, before eating, and after spraying their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Additionally, it recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is generated by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand sanitizer".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and providing support to other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that people who suspect they may have the virus wear a plain face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
To reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, precautions should be taken, especially in health care settings, when aerosol generating procedures such as duct penetration or manual ventilation are performed.
For healthcare workers caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the individual in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and ventilation precautions. CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE bags, respirators or face masks, eye protection equipment, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial systems, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy for a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non - approved experiments.
CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a few percent do.


Some practitioners prefer to use intramuscular mechanical ventilation when available as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal ventilation. Serious cases are most common in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, limiting the ability of a health system to handle the sudden increase in the number of sufficiently serious COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for labor, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have eventually been admitted to ICU.
The mechanical transmission becomes more complicated as COVID-19 develops Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and oxygen supply becomes progressively more difficult.
Ventilators with high PEEPs and pressure control systems are required to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of ventilator-associated lung damage and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments started in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.

Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO has recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has provisionally authorized health-beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where there is a serious or immediate threat to the person's life.
The necessary clinical studies have not been conducted to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
To combat the outbreak, China launched a mobile app in February 2020.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is capable of detecting potential risk of infection by detecting 'close contact' using surveillance data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
This measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who come into contact with infected citizens.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Russia employs facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Giulio Gallerà, Commissario Regionale di Salute Italiana, ha detto che gli è stato comunicato dai gestori del cellulare che "il 40% delle persone ha effettuato qualche tipo di spostamento".
The German government organised a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Furthermore, Estonia's President, Kirsty Kaljulaid, made a global call for constructive solutions to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience crisis due to quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of infection themselves.
"The rising social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn are the perfect storm to damage people's mental health and wellbeing", quotes Rory O'Connor from the BBC.
The disease may have a mild course with or without some symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, whereas cases with severe or hypersevere illnesses may take three to six weeks to heal.
Based on data from other similar viruses like SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at high risk for serious infection with COVID-19, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, acute trauma or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19 related complications include dizziness, abnormal scaling and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Scandial abnormalities, particularly prothrombin time increases, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while 4% of this group have seen abnormal kidney function.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days spent in hospital.
, patients transferred to ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of early cases, the average time from the onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate was 2.8% in men, while the mortality rate was 1.7% in women.
Tissue pathology tests of autopsy lung samples show radiocellulose damage with cellular fibromycoid leaks in both lungs.
Virus - causing cell degeneration was observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs looked similar to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the US March, 89% of people admitted to hospital had pre-existing conditions. Availability of medical resources and socioeconomic status of a region can also affect mortality.
The estimate of mortality varies from situation to situation, due to regional differences and systemic difficulties.
The mortality rate may be overestimated due to the low count of mild cases.

Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than nonsmokers and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been expressed about long-term pathological symptoms of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some recovering patients, and lung scans revealed organ damage.
It can also cause post - intensive care syndrome after recovery.

Immunity is seen as potential based on behaviour of other coronaviruses, but positive testing cases for coronaviruses have been reported at a later date after recovery from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worse than a recurrent infection.
The virus is considered to be of an animal origin, spreading naturally and via animal to human infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was given as 1 December 2019.
WHO official publications reported the first onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.

These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.

Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of individuals diagnosed as dying from a disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.

At the centre of the outbreak in Italy, in Castiglione d'Aeda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelet, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, which led to a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been formally classified.
Besides, the German health system is not extreme.
In the Netherlands, as assessed from blood donors, about 3% may be immune.
69 deaths (0.004% of population) have been confirmed from COVID-19.
The impact of an epidemic and its mortality varies for men and women.
The study, which was conducted in China and Italy, found that men had a higher mortality rate.
The risk for men is highest in their 50s, and the gap between men and women only narrows at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this gender gap are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, D stands for Disease, and 19 stands for the year when the outbreak was first identified i.e. 31st December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), species of animals or group of people, which are consistent with international recommendations for naming with the aim of preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as interim names for acute respiratory disease virus and disease, which complies with the 2015 guidelines not to use placenames in disease and virus names.
The formal names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.

In one example, when an Italian hospital needed ventilate valves urgently, and the supplier was unable to provide within the required timeframe, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.

The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being conducted by government organisations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "Solidarity Trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hopes of effectiveness.
currently, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being examined.
First, researchers aim to create a complete virus vaccine.
The goal of using such viruses, whether inactive or dead, is to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
Another strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to some subcomponents of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-contact protein which helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology for making vaccines).
The pilot vaccines of any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and efficacy.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus. Antibody dependent growth has been cited as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.

Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
With nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir in several countries scheduled to be reported by the end of April, most Chinese research is working on reusable antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was underway.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence for the efficacy of Remdesivir is available.
Clinical improvement was seen in patients treated with non-approved use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which is already used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with initial results.
However, there have been calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommended a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice as much is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use for protection from COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required for suppression of the synthetic environment of SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further study in organisms after showing low concentration suppression of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial contact protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with ACE2 receptor.
The major limitations of studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Osaltamivir does not inhibit the synthetic environment SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Cytocin elevations can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine properties. Tokilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China following the completion of a small study.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non-randomized trial nationwide in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
In conjunction with serum ferritin blood test to identify increased cytokine levels, it aims to counter such aggravated events, which are thought to cause death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by FDA in 2017, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroidal inhibitor cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosilezumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of pure and concentrated immunoglobulins produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccination method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral desensitization is the anticipated mechanism by which passive antibody therapy may mediate protection from SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, such as antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of health-beneficial serums, which contain the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and have specific immunity to this virus, can be increased for rapid planning.
