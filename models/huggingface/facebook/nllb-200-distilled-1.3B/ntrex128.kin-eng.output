Members of the Pei de Gale (AMs) are concerned about 'looking like puppet masters'
There is concern among some MPs who suggest that their title should be changed to Members of Parliament (MWPs).
It was promoted by a proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Pei de Gale Legislative Assembly.
Members of the Parliament in the political arena are concerned that this will lead to their being stigmatized.
A Labour MP said the party he represented was concerned that the term "sounds like Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh twp means crazy and pwp means a wimp.
A member of the Plaid Party's Executive Council said that the party as a whole was "disappointed" and made other demands.
The representative of the conservative Pei de Gale party said that the party he represents was "open to different opinions" on the name change, but stressed that there was no significant difference between MWP (Member of Parliament) and Muppet (Doll).
It is in this context that the Welsh letter w is pronounced as the Yorkshire English speakers pronounce the u sound.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing a bill to change the name, said: "The final decision on the definition of the members of the Assembly will be made by the members themselves".
The Gaelic Government Act 2017 empowered the members of the Gaelic Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the wishes of the majority of citizens who supported the Parliament to be called the Pei de Gale Parliament.
On the issue of the appointment of Members of Parliament (AM), the Commission gave a high probability of being referred to as Pei de Gale or WMP members, but the MWP's choice was largely supported in public consultation.
The House seemed to be proposing alternatives, but it was difficult to reach agreement with the senior leader, Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a bill on the changes in weeks.
The reform law includes further changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules governing the dismissal of Assembly members (AM) and the structure of committees.
The members of the Assembly will vote definitively on the question of whether to name the bill when they vote on it.
Macedonians go to the polls to debate the country's name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was called to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece's neighbor, whose province is Macedonia.
The Greek government, based in Athens, has insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is appropriate to its region and has repeatedly denied the country membership in the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would not vote.
However, supporters of the party, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is the only price to pay for joining the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are no longer ringing as churches in Harlem face problems.
"Historically, the adults I spoke to said there was a café and a temple on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"There is nothing today".
He said the lack of a bar was understandable.
"People interact in different ways these days", she says.
"Bars are no longer a chat room where people go on a regular basis".
As for the temples, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as the authorities expect, "and soon things will be back to normal".
He adds: Churches can be replaced by altars with multiple rooms filled with people of different races who will not help but keep it sacred.
"The majority of residents who buy rooms in these buildings are white", he said, "thus reducing the total number of days these churches close because it is unlikely that these people who move into these rooms will become members of these churches".
Churches built by white congregations before Harlem became a predominantly black city - Urban in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
A white Methodist congregation moved in in the 1930s.
The black congregation that worshiped nearby soon named themselves after the temple.
The St. Martin's Chapel was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who had once arrested small businessmen on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while the parishioners under Pastor Johnson were planning to rebuild, they sold the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of the Reverend Johnson and heir to St Martin's, was proud to call the bell "the poor man's bell".
The expert who spoke at the July conference called it "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical artifact".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the world's first trumpet played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played the big trumpet at Riverside Cathedral 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin never replaced him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's were a puzzling story for architects and signatories, some brought in by lay church leaders and others brought in by the Episcopal Diocese.
Sacristy: The parish council, which consists of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was "looking for ways to pay for" the sacristy, although the sacristy has nothing to do with hiring architects and signers of the contracts sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of lightworking on the part of the diocese.
A fisherman injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting for lobsters in California.
Officials said a fish that was caught and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the season was a lobster.
The seizure occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was going to dive with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and a team rushed to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the sound of the joy of chasing lobsters, but then "he realized it was a scream, 'It's me!
He's got me!'
What Hammel saw when he reached the boy: The entire shoulder bone was visible,
Hammel continues: "I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'Here's a fish that's swimming in the water!'"
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is currently in critical condition.
The species of carnivorous fish that may have attacked is unknown.
At a press conference, Captain Larry Giles, a lifeguard, said that the fish had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not considered a problematic species.
Giles went on to say that the victim had severe injuries to the upper chest.
Authorities have restricted access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security and security reasons.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of fish in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is approaching Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a retail chain of beauty salons and professional customer service.
As part of a major move into the UK's $2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as the fashion and home goods industry continues to decline, major beauty retailers will test 11 stores in the province and expand to other stores next year once they prove profitable.
Investing in beauty products is similar to figuring out how mainstream markets use shelf space to install TVs, microphones and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it could double its retail beauty product portfolio to 3,000 products, including major brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Traditional brands from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have plenty of space for similarly sized brands like Boots.
The developed market is also re-introducing cosmetics stores to make most products more suitable for vegetarians, which is a growing demand among younger consumers.
And the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be exploring the possibility of two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping is a shift away from buying small amounts of food every day in a convenience store, which means that large stores have to do more to attract more customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores would grow as supermarkets as larger stores try to compete with rivals including Aldi and Lidl that offer more services and no groceries.
Sainsbury's has added Argos mini-shops to more than a hundred stores and has also opened Habitats stores as it acquired the brand from both stores two years ago, which has meant increased food sales and increased profits.
A pilot project by a large beauty and pharmaceutical retailer to convert its stores ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a business combination with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger ended in a split decision to split the revenue from the pharmacy into its own supermarkets.
The new measures come after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds is said to be involved in the scheme, adding other high-end brands of body oils including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief marketing officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We changed the look and feel of the beauty department to improve where our customers shop.
We also invited our specially trained colleagues who will be nearby to provide advice.
Our species was designed to accommodate each need and attraction and to be in the right place, which means that we are now the ones who are going to need aesthetic devices that are going to be a revolution in the traditional way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from £11m settlement
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was left 'extremely angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11m luxury business deal to focus on her new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home-fashion and jewelry company Truly.
The business relationship between the two has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter took to Instagram to announce her resignation.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den player Peter Jones in a rage after stepping down from the luxury lifestyle company's business operations at the last minute to focus on her personal high-profile deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "extremely angry" when the TV star admitted in a keynote speech on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal was worth around £1.5 million; meaning she was out of time to make room for home-made clothing company Truly.
The business is comparable to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and is expected to double Willoughby's £11 million turnover.
While Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones flew from England to one of his resorts.
"Truly it was not close to Holly's priorities", the reporter said.
It was about to be a long time coming for him for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was a surprise to all concerned.
What happened on Tuesday was hard to believe, for it was about to begin.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow HQ ready to sell".
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most successful celebrities, could cost the company millions due to the massive investment in products ranging from mattresses and candles to clothing and homewear and further delay its launch.
And it may have meant the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby has three children with her husband Dan Baldwin, who has been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as CEO in March.
The two families operate vacation rentals together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin TV.
Willoughby is expected to become an ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, a source close to Jones said: "We cannot comment on his business practices".
We had a serious conversation and "loved each other"
He joked about the criticism in the media suggesting that some would take it as "unpresidentially inappropriate" and his strong support for the North Korean leader.
Why did the President give so much?
Trump spoke in a critical tone of "read the news".
"I have never given anything".
He said Kim was interested in a second summit after the previous summit in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a major step in discouraging North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.
But talks to stop nuclear weapons are slow.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "comprehensive response" from the US to North Korea's efforts to denuclearize early.
Instead, he said the US is enforcing sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump made a positive statement in his campaign speech.
"We know North Korea well", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people died.
Now we have this wonderful marriage".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, halting missile tests, helping to free prisoners and allowing the remaining American workers to return home.
And he spoke of his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded room, we would have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing more than a hundred people.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, international NGOs were told that it was not necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been evacuated, no national emergency has been declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, it was largely clear that they would not seek international support, so it is difficult", said Mr Sumbung.
While Save the Children is looking for a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear if foreign workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian authorities were reviewing the situation in Palu to determine whether international organizations could be allowed to contribute aid.
Because Indonesia is prone to earthquakes, the country is prone to disasters.
While a tsunami warning system was built in Aceh, it is not visible in the rest of the coast.
The absence of tsunami warnings in Palu, despite the warning system, likely contributed to the death toll.
Travel between many of Indonesia's islands is often difficult.
Disasters make it more difficult to use equipment.
A hospital ship is parked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
During his campaign, President Joko Widodo blamed corrupt infrastructure reforms in Indonesia for his election and misappropriation of funds for road and railway construction.
But the lack of funding for various projects has been a hallmark of Mr Joko's rule as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from Indonesia's religious wars, where the Muslim majority has become more conservative in their beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim youths fought in the streets, using spears, bows and arrows and other traditional weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from relegation to the Premier League by scoring a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was sent off by Xherdan Shaqiri as he was 27 yards from Chelsea's 1-0 loss.
He moves the ball to his left before shooting for the second ball.
The shot hit the right corner above the guard.
The ball came down through Kepa Arrizabalaga and shook the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: "I was reluctant to try to get in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as close as possible, so I tried to find a way to get the ball as close as possible.
"I saw Kante coming and I touched a ball, I didn't think about it too much and I shot".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian legend Eden Hazard.
The blue-collar guard passed a game-winning pass to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before running into the middle of the field and into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic saved and passed the ball to the center.
He then makes a perfect shot at Hazard who is in the Chinese net.
Hazard ran past the guards and threw the ball into the net with his left foot through Liverpool defender Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the National Disaster Management Agency said in the early hours of Sunday.
Several people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of a house that was destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday that caused a 6 meter high gust, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is covered in collapsed building rubble.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked residents to report anything they see or hear.
Detective Detective Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its infancy but I would ask anyone in the area of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to report it.
I would be happy if anyone; especially taxi drivers, who may have video footage taken with their dashboard cameras, could inform us because they may have important information in our investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was found in a house in Birkenhead.
This afternoon, friends who believed to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as the police said they would be preparing a system to notify the next of kin of the deceased.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to return to his flat but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He said what he was talking about when he found out what happened.
Now, residents are being told that it will take hours to be allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling someone that the entire area would now be considered a crime zone.
A woman was seen crying at the scene.
"It's very scary", he continued.
At 2 pm, two policemen were in front of the crime scene with another van parked outside.
Several police officers were stationed in front of the crime scene, searching different floors.
Anyone with information is urged to immediately email @MerPolCC, call 101 or report to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, citing a September 30 report 247.
The Cromwell Plaque in Parliament is the latest monument to the challenge of 'rewriting history'
The ban on the statue will be seen as a punishment for the destruction of British cultural and religious objects such as those made by the Taliban by Puritan fans and followers.
But the Cromwellian Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "There is no escaping the discussion that the removal of the mosaics of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would also be a threat.
It is a graphic depiction of the English Civil Wars and none of them were demanded or opposed by Cromwell.
The crime for which Cromwell was crucified was the actions of his first-century ancestor Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's portrayal of Cromwell is a hallmark of 19th-century ideology and one of the parts of pottery history where many believe it is still appreciated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of the supremacy of Parliament and the pressure from outside to adopt the monarchy.
Whether this is the case in general is a topic of ongoing debate in the historical press.
The fact is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century were caused by the development of our countries and Cromwell is a well-known individual who reflects one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered".
A killer pig ate a Chinese farmer to death.
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to media reports.
The man, known only by the alias "Yuan", was found dead in a ruptured spleen, covered in pig's blood, at a piggy bank in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly went to his cousin in the neighboring Yunna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He said there was a male pig in the pigsty with blood in his mouth.
Scientific evidence concluded that the 226-pound pig ate the farmer to death, according to the report.
His cousin referred to him by another name: "My cousin's legs were bloody and severely bitten", as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
The manager of the market told the Evening News that the pig was being held to prevent another attack while police gather evidence.
Yuan's family and the market administration said they were discussing a mourning ceremony for his death.
Although rare, human-to-human pig problems have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had been tied to a Pei de Gale farmer's car until a woman pushed the pig away.
After an Oregon pig was killed by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are unusual for aggression but that eating blood could be a "crisis driver".
"They want to play.
They are sleepy, they are very curious ... they are not meant to hurt you.
You have to respect them", he said.
Storms from Hurricane Rosa brought heavy rains across much of the U.S. southwest.
On the weather front, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains and flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Tropical Storm Rosa had maximum sustained winds of 86 miles per hour (136 km/h), and was a Category 1 hurricane as of 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was located about 400 miles (620 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the storm intensified into a Pacific hurricane and moved westward toward the West Coast of the United States, while Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm that began to reach tropical depression strength in the north and southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical winds will then be combined with an approaching storm to produce heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
In this area, rainfall can be as much as 2.5 to 10 centimeters, causing severe flooding, erosion, and desert landslides.
Strong tropical temperatures will cause rainfall of 5 to 7 cm per hour at a time; particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
While 5 to 10 cm of rainfall is expected in the southern regions, mainly in Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible where it is likely to decrease because of the scattered rainfall in the tropics.
It may not be a good idea to go to the desert where tropical rainfall is possible.
Heavy rains can turn valleys into torrential rivers and thunderstorms can produce strong winds and blow up dust.
A storm is coming with heavy rainfall in parts of Southern California near the coast.
Rainfall may reach 1 cm, causing minor damage to flow and causing roads to slip.
This would be the first rainfall in the region in the rainy season.
Some of the tropical rainfall from various locations will begin to approach Arizona during the peak hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the heavy rains begin to fall during the peak hours of Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will reach the Four Corners area on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may see a significant temperature change in the Americas as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics continue to warm.
Sometimes it causes large temperature changes over small distances.
There is a significant difference in temperature between the US and the US on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of approximately 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to come back and get higher.
Temperatures are expected to peak in October in most of the central and eastern United States and in some areas to reach about 26 degrees Celsius from the southern hemisphere to the northeastern hemisphere.
New York City could reach 26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures reaching parts of the eastern US through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched the dramatic testimony of former Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his alleged sexual assault victim Christine Blasey Ford on six television networks in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political tensions continued, with TV newscasters interrupting a regular Friday broadcast at the last minute: It was a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI investigate the alleged crimes within a week.
Ford told the Senate Appropriations Committee that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had overindulged and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who testified using a black-and-white photograph, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were reported by Nielsen on Friday to have watched it.
The company is currently counting the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available from other networks that provided evidence including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems counting people watching shows in the office.
To be clear, they are the same people as the Academy Awards or the Oscars.
Nielsen said: Fox News Channel, which has a strong guest host support for Kavanaugh's nomination, led the network in average viewership with 5.69 million for the day's proceedings.
ABC was the number one with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said: CBS was watched by 3.1 million, NBC by 2.4 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million and CNN by 2.52 million.
There is still a lot of excitement after the trial.
Flake was the focus of Friday's events.
After the Republican Bureau made the announcement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to enter the elevator into the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stared down at the criticism for several minutes, which was immediately picked up by CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the people of the whole country?
She was told, "You have a lot of power when too many women don't have power"".
Flake said his office was surprised and said he had made a lot of statements at the committee hearing before the elevator closed.
Television and cable channels were on the move immediately hours later, when the Appeals Committee voted to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the next level for a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI wanted to investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which a handful of Democrats had called for.
Flake was reportedly one of the guests in an interview with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Coons and other senators later, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was strong, as it was clear that Republicans would not vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview following the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked his Brexit strategy in the press, calling the idea that the UK and EU should both be taxed "absolutely bizarre".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU athlete
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Police released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson and Police said that Sims lost his lights in the fight.
According to CBS affiliate WAFB, police found the lights at the crime scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
His lawyer says the bail he would offer for his release is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that he died from gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The Police Department commends the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Tracking Station, the Police Department Crime Prevention Laboratory, Southern University Police and the community for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva praised local law enforcement for their "accurate and consistent approach to providing real justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "deeply saddened" by Waydeh's death.
"This is what we are constantly concerned about", Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl eruption reached the southern tip of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Management Agency warned Mexicans to avoid approaching the volcano after it re-emerged from its peak and reportedly released 183 gases and ash over 24 hours.
The facility was undergoing a series of delays and delays.
International images showed ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City's Xochimilco neighborhood.
Geologists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the city as a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been erupting since 1994.
Police are among the Catalan independence campaigners ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands of people joined others in a protest marking the anniversary of Catalonia's independence vote.
A group of masked pro-independence protesters were pushed back by riot police who threw eggs and paint on them, creating a dark cloud of dust in the streets, which are usually packed with tourists.
The clashes broke out in the early hours of the day when police were using the ramp to quell the clashes.
Pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" for hours, while protestors chanted "Spain lives forever".
According to local media, fourteen people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries in the riots.
Tensions remain high among the pro-independence faction a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but welcomed by pro-independence activists.
Voters voted for independence, despite low turnout and a large influx of anti-independence protesters to disrupt the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police blocked the elections at several polling stations in the region in violent clashes.
On Friday, pro-independence groups had camped out overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The protests took place but were forced to be held elsewhere.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the independence demonstration with his wife, said there was no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year was a good year for us.
I saw my parents cry tears of joy because they were able to vote and now we have no choice".
Despite a small victory in the regional elections in December last year, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have been hampered by the strong showing this year, with many prominent asylum seekers or jailed leaders awaiting trial for their role in organizing the demonstrations and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police using her mobile phone, said the clashes were caused by politicians on both sides.
"It's going to be harder", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan provincial officials who has been in custody since last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to protest against the decline of democratic values and the repression we have seen in Spain", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car reportedly collided with a house in Londonderry.
The crash occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 UK time.
Deputy Superintendent Bob Blemmings said that the damage was to the gates and the building itself.
An arrow may have been fired at the car.
Menga's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 lead over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal against Livingston was the winner.
Livingston's promotion to the Premier League surprised Rangers with Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference as Gary Holt's side went into second place to find themselves at Hibernian.
Gerrard's side remained unbeaten in the Championship this season and will face top-flight Hearts, who are eight points clear at the top, on Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League group stage on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has continued to extend its undefeated streak in the league to six games, with head coach Holt facing a losing record since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed his chance to beat the weaker visiting team.
Holt's team should be far ahead of the winning team, while his lack of consistency is causing all the problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass the guards but the ball passed the guard and Alan Lithgow managed to hit the ball out after a slip to meet the ball that was hit by Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could challenge the visitors on the away balls.
In this way the necessary trap was found.
Rangers lost the opening game and Livingston opened the scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to score a goal for Menga, who made a physical from the centre of the net.
At this level, the Rangers were very particular about the ball but found the back wall of the visiting team unbreakable and the defender, Liam Kelly, who had not taken any strong balls, was not able to break through.
The game continued in the second half, despite Alfredo Morelos's goal and Kelly's return.
Scott Pittman's goal was dismissed by Rangers defender Allan McGregor and Lithgow's goal came after another defensive goal by Livingston.
Shots to the front of the net continued to come through the Livingston website but were kept from reaching the net, with two penalties being called, after Halkett made a foul on substitute Glenn Middleton and a handball, both of which were not delivered.
The analysis says Livingston played 'extraordinary'

The extra play was a successful end to the game for Livingston.
They certainly played well, continuing to play well as the game progressed.
Their style and skill set have changed little since their return to the big leagues, but Holt's scores have been so high that he has put the team on a roll since his arrival.
He has a lot of good players.
Captain Halkett played well, putting the returning players in line, while Menga took Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall for the rest of the game.
And the Rangers did not do much on the pitch.
They have always played well since they started under Gerrard, but they have not done anything special this time.
The final ball did not reach the goal, only one goal was scored, but this resulted in the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the league table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday, there was laughter and not a laugh (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for the 25,000 people who were barred from gathering outside the mosque, but many of his supporters came to the area to see their president.
Hundreds of people protested against Erdogan; most of them Kurds, who have made their voices heard, protesting Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests were sparked by the hostility of a guest who was seen as a prince by some German Turks and a tyrant by others.
Deptford Road accident: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city centre at around 10:15 am UK time.
The driver stopped and paramedics helped him, but the driver died at the scene.
A month later, another driver was hit by an unidentified vehicle on Childers Road, a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The highway patrolman said that the police would work to identify the man and alert his brothers.
The road was closed and buses were diverted and motorcyclists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in clashes
The prison director announced that six guards were injured in the fighting at the maximum security men's prison.
The fighting began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 UK time on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialists in the field, known as "Tornado", were brought in to deal with the fighting, with eight prisoners being held in a single cell.
The officers were treated at the scene with non-life-threatening facial injuries.
A prison spokesperson said: "Specialised guards have been brought in to deal with the ongoing fighting at HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that those involved will be reported to the police and their prison terms may be extended".
HMP Long Lartin is home to over 500 inmates, including some nationally known criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was hospitalized after being threatened by the inmate.
And in October last year, riot police officers were called in to deal with violent clashes in the prison where workers were attacked with bicycle rackets.
Hurricane Rose is causing concern in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City due to rapid flooding (Drought-affected areas can benefit)
Tropical storms are unusual for Arizona, but they are most likely early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa reach the southwestern desert, causing rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, the eastern coast of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving at the rainy hour on Monday.
According to the Phoenix National Weather Service, "ten tropical cyclones have produced hurricanes within 200 miles [200 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was the strongest hurricane to hit the state from a distance of 64 km from the AZ border".
The National Hurricane Center has developed a forecast for rainfall of 5 to 10 cm, possibly up to 15 cm, in the Mogollon Rim region of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, can receive 2 to 5 cm of precipitation, with up to 10 cm of precipitation possible.
For those who are not at risk of rapid flooding, the rainfall from Rosa can be a boon after a region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of these rains could bring benefits to the southwest hemisphere in the dry season.
Weather.com reports that according to the National Center for Drought Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is at least in severe drought, the highest level.
First, the path of the Rosa cyclone leads to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a strong hurricane on Sunday with maximum sustained winds of 136 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 20 km/h.
The wind is colliding with the cold Pacific Ocean and causing it to slow down.
So, a tropical storm-force is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico can cause severe flooding.
"A total of 7 to 15 inches of rainfall can be expected from Baja California to northeastern Sonora, where up to 25 inches of rain is possible", reports Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical storm, which will continue its path through Arizona into southern Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
The National Hurricane Center states: "The primary concerns for Rosa or its associated storms are heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert".
The rainfall is expected to cause rapid flooding that could kill lives and cause desert erosion and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four suspects arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries on Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 UTC on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he continued to receive treatment but was "not seriously ill".
Police said a 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have a cell phone with video of the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has been subjected to the wrath and brutality" of the Democratic Party
"Electing Judge Kavanaugh is an election that rejects the cruel and damaging tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said during his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been "aligned with the rage and brutality" of the Democratic Party throughout his campaign.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh began testifying before Congress in a strong and emotional denial of claims by Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually harassed him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies at the trial on the charges.
"Americans saw Kavanaugh's talent, beauty and passion that day", the president said on Saturday.
"Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to affirm the many achievements of the greatest jurist of our time, a judge who has done unparalleled work for the public", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a direct reference to Kavanaugh's nomination while discussing the importance of a Republican majority in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our time.
I am not campaigning, but I am campaigning".
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the big guys".
Trump said Democrats have a plan to "clamp down and block action".
A senior Republican official told CNN that the first important step in the election is expected to be Senate confirmation of Kavanaugh's nomination, which will be done by Friday.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, with death toll still rising
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people were killed, mostly by coastal cyclones, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, more than a hundred people gathered at a beach parade in Palu when a six-meter (18-foot) high wind struck the beach in the evening, killing dozens and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"As the tsunami threat escalated yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beaches and did not run away and die", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency BNPB, in an interview in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come in vain, it came with cars, logs, water, and everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami reached the sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before striking the coast.
He says that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated from the area and taken to 24 camps in Palu.
Air photos released by the Disaster Management Agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges damaged and mosques flooded.
On Saturday, a small earthquake followed a strong one that continued to shake coastal cities.
Seismic activity was felt in areas with a population of about 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Bureau of Land Management and Technology (BPPT) said Friday's quake was nearly 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The report adds that due to the nature of the city, it is located in a coastal area that can increase the severity of tsunamis.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, clinics, shops and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found buried in the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding to 540 injured and 29 missing, he said.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be extensive along the coastline about 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggala area, which is near the epicenter.
Nugroho said that access and communication were "severely disrupted where no information could flow" from Donggala.
The Red Cross said the area had a population of 300,000", adding that its staff and volunteers would be dispatched to the affected areas.
"It's already dangerous", he says, "but it could be worse".
On Saturday, the agency reported severe criticism for not reporting a tsunami on Palu, but officials said the waves came as warnings were being issued.
In a series of photos shared on social media, a man is seen standing on a building's rooftop, screaming and warning people that a tsunami is coming down the street below him.
Within minutes, a huge wave of water washed up on the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
The military began sending relief cargo from Jakarta and other cities, and officials said evacuees were in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was extended to remain closed for emergency purposes until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It's really bad.
Mr Doseba said that when World Vision staff from Donggala arrived in Palu, where staff were staying in Tarpaulin apartments to set up their offices in the courtyard, they passed through the affected area and reached the area.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
It's really bad.
Although relief teams have started relief efforts, some complain that highly experienced foreign aid workers will be prevented from traveling to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations on financial, material and personnel transfers, foreign workers may be unable to work during the emergency relief period declared in response to a national emergency.
It would not be.
"It is still a provincial epidemic", said a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says no, 'No problem, it's a national emergency,' we can open up international assistance but the situation is not clear".
As the second night arrived on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the victims were hopeful that their loved ones would miraculously return to the disaster.
On Saturday, a small boy was removed from the nest.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped in the rubble of a house for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national clay hockey team, had trained two missing athletes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that the others arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a head clay court coach, I have my own special feelings", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that, hours after the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed in a mud game, he sent a sad WhatsApp message to contestants from Palu, who were at a beach festival.
Only his message, which showed that it was sent but not read.
"I don't think the message was read", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while being pulled from an ATM in Newport, Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee as she was withdrawing cash from an ATM in Newport, Levee, according to a report by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was withdrawing cash from an ATM in the theater and was preparing to hand over cash, according to investigator Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
While he was busy, another man "came from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag containing money to donate.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to reports, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the robbery.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the victims can call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
"I am officially aware of my name being Kanye West", he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday.
West, 41, has long used the pseudonym Ye and is credited with the naming of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes come ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is set to release her debut album Yandhi.
The host said he replaced the singer Ariana Grande in an interview where she said she was not leaving "for emotional reasons".
Even though it is a spelling of his professional name, West has said that the word has religious meaning to him.
Earlier this year, Wese said in a discussion about his album with Big Boy that he "believes 'he' is the most common word in the Bible and in the Bible it means 'you'".
"So, I am you, I am we, we are we.
It comes from Kanye, which means one, one, one, one; it represents the image of the good, the bad, the confusing, everything.
The fragrance reflects who we are".
He is one of the most famous singers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also spells the name in parentheses or in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vowed not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student uprising.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador at Tlatelolco Plaza assured that he would "never use the military to silence Mexicans".
Military forces opened fire on peaceful protesters at the palace on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when student anti-government protests were gaining momentum in Central America.
Lopez Obrador promised to help Mexican youth by providing financial aid to students and opening several public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
America should double the money spent on intellectual property.
While China is expanding its artificial intelligence efforts, the United States should double its spending on AI research, according to Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These opinions come after a number of departments of the US government have expressed concern about intellectual property; although the US generally has no clear policy on intellectual property.
Meanwhile, China launched its own program last year: It aims to be the number one innovator in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, because other countries are still far behind the United States and we are looking to reach out to the AI community", Lee said.
Doubling the funding can double the chances of major intellectual property projects being successful in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a firm that invested in China's leading artificial intelligence company, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a way to use artificial intelligence to outsmart the top-scoring American actor Othello, and later became the CEO of Microsoft's research division and head of Google's China division.
Lee endorsed US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and was asked when future competitions would be held to help identify future engineers.
Lee says that American researchers often work hard to win government funding.
"China is not only taking away talented teachers, it is also taking away companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired renowned academics to work on AI projects over the past few years.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could help the United States increase its intellectual capacity.
"I believe that permanent residency in the United States, known as a green card, should be granted immediately to those with a master's degree in natural sciences", he said.
The State Council of China issued the next-generation development plan for artificial intelligence in July 2017.
Lee says the Chinese Foundation for Science and Technology (FSF) funds academic institutions in much the same way that the Foundation for Science and Technology (FST) and other government agencies fund U.S. researchers, but that academic work is of low quality in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Institute on Artificial Intelligence, which meant improved collaboration between industry and academia and the US President announced the creation of a special committee to review artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced it will invest $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers have called for the creation of a National Commission on the Protection of Intellectual Property, after months of inaction.
Macedonians vote to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has refused to apply for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbor and has suspended its bid to join NATO and the European Union.
The two countries reached an agreement in June on a new name, but nationalists say the change could undermine the identity of Macedonia's predominantly Salivic ethnic group.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote for the campaign and the prolonged campaign has created confusion over whether the minimum turnout will reach the 50 percent needed to make the campaign valid.
The question in the ballot box reads: "Do you accept our membership in the NATO Military Cooperation Organization and the European Union under the terms of our agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to pay to ensure that they remain in the mainstream of major organizations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the breakaway states from Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje: "I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia; to live in freedom as a member of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us".
Although not legally binding, enough lawmakers said they would respect the results of the vote to allow a decision to be made.
A change of name requires the approval of two-thirds of the members of the Legislative Assembly.
The National Election Commission said no emergency was declared until 1pm.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote because my children, where we have to live, is in Europe", said Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, would set up a small podium and open a bench in front of the tents set up by the protesters.
"We need to join NATO and the EU, but we want to join in peace, not through a wall", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to treat us like Macedonia, we can look to other countries like China and Russia and join the EU that links Europe and Asia".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO members would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
After the vote, Zaev said: "I hope that most people will vote well because more than 80 percent of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO".
"Yes", he said, should be "a guarantee of our future".
A poll on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are likely to vote for the opposition, a figure never before required for a valid election.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said yes.
A vote of at least 50 percent is required for a debate to be approved.
If it fails, the debate could be seen as a challenge to pro-Western politics since the government took power in May last year.
See also: Manchester City player scores goal against Brighton's backroom staff
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling replaced Brighton's full-back in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look so easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given the ball in the middle of the field to exchange the ball early on.
He ran through at least three backs for Brighton, before running out.
Aguero was then surrounded by four grass ball players.
He hit a back-up before running and leaving several others on the side of the Brighton pitch.
He then passes the ball to his left, passing it to Sterling.
The English defender used his first ball to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton defender Mathew Ryan and sent the ball into the right half of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero is suffering from a leg problem".
"We said we could play him for 55, 60 minutes.
It did.
We were lucky that he scored a goal in that time".
But it was Sterling who gave the blue team their first chance to win a Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero was handed a ball that was shot on Brighton's official website during the match.
He then sends a good ball to the left half of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane nodded a few times before he threw it forward for Sterling to hit the other side's pot.
The attacker in the blue jersey threw the ball into the net before he was able to put the ball back in the net.
City will play Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA European Championship at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants an unnamed team to play the Rockies.
While the Nationals were promoted in the playoffs, there was little reason to force the start of another tournament.
But the aspiring player Scherzer hopes to go out on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but in the playoffs he is playing for the Rockies, which is better than a one-game win over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies narrowly missed the playoffs with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but are still looking to win their first division title.
"Although we are not playing, at least we can get on the field knowing the situation here in Denver where many people and teams will be playing at the highest level of all possible games this year.
Why don't I want to play?"
The Nationals are set to announce the first game on Sunday, but it is rumored that they will let Scherzer play in that game.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, was released from his regular position on Thursday but will return to his regular position on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump ran for office in West Virginia
The president addressed the issue of his choice of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of a Republican majority in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done will be at risk in November.
It is five weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
"This is a very important thing, I am not running but I am running for the truth and that is why I will not be running for the big candidates".
Trump continued: "You see this very bad, bad but radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to recover by any means possible, given their cruelty, their evil.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they have to push to get power and control, what they want and what they want and what they want, we won't give it to them".
The Democrats have a "hardline and blockade" program.
"And you see that in the last four days", he says of the Democrats, "they have been angry, cruel and evil and unreliable".
He spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, where he was immediately booed by the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you ever published a book?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, not a moment; that was the worst body language, the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labor activism is no longer characterized by a diversity of ideas.
It is becoming intolerant of people who speak their minds.
When the local Momentum activists voted to oppose me, it was a surprise.
In short, I am the only Labour MP who was told I was not welcome to speak my mind.
My colleague in Congress, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the protest was a criticism because I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The value of economic policies is being questioned by human actions, by national security, by Europe, and by the loss of jobs, which are similar issues Jeremy disagreed with previous administrations.
A statement announcing Friday's Nottingham East Labour conference said: "We want the conference to be continuous and productive".
For almost eight years as a Labour MP, Friday night's GC meeting was a success.
Unfortunately, today, many conferences are not being held in this way and the political commitment to "love and compassion" has been forgotten even before it began.
It has become increasingly clear that diversity of opinion is not tolerated within the Labour Party and that each opinion must be determined by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when those in my party who I thought were politically aligned with me began to expect me to take a different approach and focus my attention on something I should not have agreed with; whether it was national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, and it doesn't matter what I say, there's a lot of anger from the campaign platforms that I should be fired from socialist politics, that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not my experience.
Yes, I know I am more fortunate than my peers because my opinions are often political.
I am deeply impressed by the professionalism and dedication of my colleagues who are being targeted on a daily basis based on their gender or skin color but who do not give up.
One of the frustrating aspects of this political movement is the level of attacks that have been taken for granted.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
The point is that we are not all capable of different opinions and the act of voting or accusing someone of being "unreliable" under certain party rules prevents the party from growing.
I have received much counsel over the past two years to keep my head down, to keep my mouth shut, and to say, "I'll be fine".
But that was not what got me into politics.
Thirty-two years after joining the Labour Party as a student, and having been left with a complete lack of confidence in the education system by the Thatcher government, I sought to improve the quality of public services for those who needed them most, whether working as a consultant to the central government or a government minister.
I have not hidden my politics, including during the recent election.
No one in Nottingham East has ever been confused by my politics or where we disagree with the existing leadership.
To those who took part in Friday's action, I would say that as the country moves towards a Brexit with a disruptive impact on households, businesses and services, I do not see the need to waste my time and energy on my integrity as leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my local voters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threats of dismissal or political pressure will stop me from working hard for what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr undefeated to take the lead
Two goals from the penalty spot were a game-changer, but Ayr were sure to win the spectacular game, which was also known as the Tennent's Day game.
They are currently leading the standings, the only undefeated team in the top 10.
They then proved to be a team with strong defence, and even luck, which gave the hosts and their coach Peter Murchie a reason to rejoice.
"We have been tested in the game so far and we were unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
"Thanks to Ayr, they have produced more success than we have", says Robyn Christie of Melrose.
Grant Anderson's shot in the 14th minute, which was scored by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, however, the yellow card given to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was offered by the Warriors to play for the national team, was allowed by Melrose to enter the game with Jason Baggot attempting to score a goal.
Climo added a penalty to Ayr's lead, and before that, just before the end of the first half, scored a solo goal to make it 17-5 for Ayr in the first period break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's shot was scored by Baggot, cutting their lead to five points.
When a late late field goal with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was ejected from the field, the game resumed, with Ayr continuing to close on a Stafford McDowall goal from Climo.
Ayr's vice-captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and Melrose sent another top scorer to the goalkeeper, Bruce Colvine, after a shadowy game.
The team was awarded a yellow card for striking Climo without a ball, and just after the goal line, MacPherson scored a goal to put Ayr on the back foot.
Climo scored as he started the replay, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong in the net and sent the ball to winger Gregor Henry in his fifth try for the host team.
A Still Game player is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game player Ford Kieran appears to be preparing to go to the reception after he receives a call from a licensed manager at a restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with his longtime co-star Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series will be the final series of the show and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official sources, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a reporter for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was interested in being part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked country Bolivia hopes to reopen its Pacific route
The Maritime Safety Authority is a maritime security agency based in La Paz.
Government buildings have a blue flag.
The seafarers' camp on Lake Titicaca from the Amazon has a motto: "We have a right to the sea.
We see it as a responsibility".
Across the landlocked country of Bolivia, the lost battle for the coastline with Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict is being commemorated today, as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again grows.
Perhaps the most optimistic in decades, Bolivia is awaiting an international vaccine ruling on October 1 after five years of waiting for a decision.
"Bolivia is strong, united and stable and we expect a decision in its favour", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Bolivians will look to the ICJ ruling on the country's acres of wetlands, hoping that the court in The Hague will find Bolivia's claim justified; after decades of fruitless negotiations, Chile was forced to negotiate a landmark agreement to grant Bolivia access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the gifted and patriotic Bolivian president, who is running for re-election next year, is also very confident that Monday's decision will be successful.
"We are very close to being back in the Pacific", he swore in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is not going to make a decision in favor of Bolivia and will make a few changes.
The UN Office in the Netherlands has no authority to assign the Shire area and says it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert, said: "The ICJ decision comes just six months after the trial found the case "uncomplicated".
To further illustrate what Bolivia is fighting for, the past four years may have set back the progress.
"The problem of working at sea has been taken hostage by the present Bolivian government", says Zárate.
He says Morales's words of support for the war have made the remaining opponents more sympathetic.
Bolivia and Chile have continued their relationship, but it will be very difficult to maintain contact after the storm.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in Lahe, rejected the idea that a hasty court ruling was unnecessary.
On Monday, it will give Bolivia "a unique opportunity to forge a new relationship with Shiri" and an opportunity to "put an end to a 139-year-old conflict and benefit both sides".
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Central America's most popular presidents, would use the maritime issue for political gain.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to operate in the Pacific Ocean", he said.
"This decision is a chance to see if we should forget the past".
North Korea says it will not stop developing nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop developing nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington.
Ri said this on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the UN to honour the pledge made at a meeting in Singapore between the two leaders.
The comments come as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to resume nuclear talks that have apparently stalled after three months of talks in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "impossible" that sanctions were still in place and the US continued to refuse to officially end the war with Korea, which did not put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is reluctant to issue a statement unless Pyongyang takes the first step to halt its nuclear program.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang has been widely criticized for insisting on denuclearization as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris is showing off new clothes that will be on the streets near you.
If you want to add a hat to your hat or sunscreen, stay close.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have launched a giant hat for the SS19 fashion group on the street where the collection was launched at Paris Fashion Week.
The giant skullcaps were widely featured on Instagram this summer and the makers showcased their amazing designs at fashion shows.
Valentino's unique helmet is a beige color with a wing-like ridge that extends forward to the head.
Other accessories that come with a large suit include a toothbrush, a hat with a large brim, and a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also showed a group of bizarre masks in the run-up to Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were designed to look more like Hannibal Lecter's lips than they did with the specifications.
One of the shells was made to look like a suit they were going to wear to dive under a hot sea with a light bulb, while the other looked like melted ice cream.
And if you keep talking about the big models, you're in luck.
Fashionistas expect these large trucks to be able to reach major roads near you.
The large caps are similar to 'La Bomba', a hard grass hat with a 60 cm diameter that has been worn by celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The world-renowned brand that made the world's largest hat was once again showing off its production at the fashion show, a bag made of hard grass to be carried on a sandbar the size of a model in a swimsuit.
A bag made of pre-fired orange raffia leaves, with leaves and a white leather handle on top, accompanied the logo of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the big hats and sandbags to hit the streets this summer; while the designer of the clothing has made a big change to the oversized ones".
John Edward: Linguistics is important to the world's population
Independent schools in Scotland continue to be at the forefront of education and this trend continued in 2018 with some excellent test results, which further emphasised the individual and overall achievements of students in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With around 30,000 students across Scotland, the schools, which are overseen by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the highest standards of providing quality services to both students and parents.
Private schools aim to better prepare their students for higher education, careers of their choice and a place in the global community.
As the education sector can develop and implement a school curriculum that is responsive to students, we are seeing new languages becoming increasingly popular and the subject of choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to a person in a language they understand, the message goes to their head.
When you speak to him in his native language, you reach his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we must not rely on English alone if we want to have a positive relationship with people in other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the charts with the highest failure rates in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students received their A above.
Data collected by SCIS from 74 schools in the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students scored an A in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, like your chosen subject, are now taken up by other STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects of choice in private school curricula or elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Commission on Employment and Skills study found that 17 percent of the reasons employers have difficulty finding candidates for jobs are due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowledge of languages will be a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
While most jobs require language, such knowledge is essential in a world that has become a village.
Regardless of the profession, learning a second language is a real opportunity to gain lifelong knowledge.
The ability to communicate directly with other people in foreign countries immediately gives the person more knowledge than other competitors in the market.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent cannot speak a foreign language fluently enough to have a conversation, while French is the only language spoken by more than 10 percent of the population, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on modern languages, while others will teach languages considered important in the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a language of choice in a private school where teachers are experts in the subject.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to teaching in a way that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the outcome.
It cannot be denied that today, in international trade, languages remain an important factor for the future of the country, and therefore should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as a "knowledge resource for international communication".
Independent schools continue to offer these options, which are different and not accessible to young people in Scotland.
The good news is that we must.
John Edward is the Chief Executive of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
On Sunday, LeBron will play his first game for the Lakers in San Diego.
The wait is almost over as fans wait to see LeBron James start his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he will play was not confirmed.
"It will be over 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will play the final few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need to play pre-season games at this stage in my career to prepare", he said.
When Trump's campaign in West Virginia, on YouTube
President Donald Trump announced his candidacy in a windy night in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five campaign events planned for next week, including a stopover in popular destinations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
While a confirmation vote would not be held on his nominee for the Supreme Court position, Trump is aiming to seek support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
When will Trump's West Virginia campaign be held tonight and how will it be seen online?
Trump's campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia online at the link to the video on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's Supreme Court nomination hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, which has been heightened by allegations of sexual misconduct after a Senate confirmation vote was postponed due to an FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of the campaign is to help Republicans face a tough November election to keep their momentum going.
Thus, Trump's campaign officials said the five campaigns next week are aimed at "empowering volunteers and activists as Republicans try to protect and expand their overwhelming numbers of senators and representatives", according to a Reuters report.
A spokesperson for Trump's campaign wanted Reuters to quote him: "Control of Congress is a key part of his agenda as the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move into a busy campaign period".
The campaign, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw campaigners from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh press", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will make his second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won by more than 40 points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is in the back seat.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters: "It's not a good sign for Morrisey to be president that he needs to come in to help him get more votes".
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows strength to maintain its lead in Sunday's games
After the season, a Saturday afternoon golf tournament may have been what the Ryder Cup needed.
Fortunately, a game idea was developed that was more trusted and competitive than the competition.
Where, then, is the source of power?
"They were six points ahead and now they are four", said afternoon's Jordan Spieth, "so I think we're going to be strong".
Europe, of course, has a chance, leading by four points with twelve games to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel they have a strong wind that is hurting their ships and have a lot to be excited about, at least not in the case of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been playing all day and scoring three points each out of four.
Spieth has been a prolific scorer from the free-throw line and is a good example.
The fans were more excited when he threw a pitch and scored the decisive points to tie the game as he and Thomas were two points behind.
His winning goal in the 15th minute was also met with cheers, a way of saying he believed the US team was missing.
"You have to get to the bottom of it and be concerned about your own game", Spieth says.
That's what each of these players has left.
18 holes to put the ball.
The only players to outscor Spieth and Thomas in the two-day event are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, both Ryder Cup champions.
The European side is still in the lead but is likely to win four of the four games without any problems.
"Moliwood" were the only two that failed to score on Saturday afternoon, but they refused to score on Saturday morning, Friday evening and in the second half of the eighteenth hole on Friday morning.
The style and the way their energy was moving was to go in and out of the remaining team and assert that they were the players to face on Sunday and there may be more players known to bring Europe victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The advantage is that both can be done on separate holes.
It would be premature to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked for Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, when he was dating Alex Noren.
The two-ball-to-nine pitch allowed the Spaniard and the Swede to score but never got the ball down the court.
On Sundays, no one is there to help you remove the ball from your basket.
Four-ball golf is a fun game to watch because of the interaction between the four players, the advice they give, the tactics they don't give and the fact that the strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe have played well as a team so far and have a strong lead on the final day, but this four-man match also showed that the US has the ability to fight for points; especially against the nations that were in doubt.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe has a good chance on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a four-shot lead on Saturday with a 10-6 win over the United States.
Top players Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game by beating Tiger Woods twice to add to their Le Golf National points totals of four.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, fighting to retain the trophy they had won from Hazeltine two years earlier, beat the less-than-successful US side in the morning four-ball match, winning 3-1.
The U.S. team defended in the fourth game, winning two games, but it did not prevent them from losing.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points in Sunday's 12-a-side game to retain the title.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to score four consecutive points as he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a successful week, became the only two players to score four points in the first four games of a Ryder Cup tournament.
His victory over Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth round gave Woods a better shot at a poorly-performing rookie from South Africa, Bryson Dechambeau, who scored more than 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed some high-level play but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-and-seven-ball games.
Justin Rose, who missed the morning four-ball, replaced his teammate Henrik Stenson in the fourth round when they lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked world No. 1 and No. 3 respectively.
Europe was not playing as it usually did, with a windy day blowing from southwest Paris.
Triple crown winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas were named the two-point shootout starters for the Americans on Saturday.
They won 2&1 over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fourth game after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team that lost by four points to a winner has reached the quarterfinals, although the Furyk side needed only a draw to retain the title.
After being good twins for two days, but now on Sunday the match will be played in revenge even though it will be over.
North Korea says there is 'no way' to de-nuclearize one country without hope
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the UN that continued sanctions were only strengthening mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could abandon its nuclear program in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told state officials at the Annual General Meeting that "adequate measures" had been taken over the past year, such as halting nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and ensuring no further development of nuclear weapons and missile technology.
"However, we do not see a satisfactory response from the US", he said.
"There is no hope for the United States to have confidence in our national security and if so, there is no way we can as a nation stop developing nuclear weapons first".
While Ri echoed the usual North Korean claims about Washington's willingness to be in the "stages" of denuclearization where North Korea can control the price as it moves forward, his comments seemed valid even though he did not deny that Pyongyang could be denuclearizing as it has done before.
Ri followed remarks by presidents Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work to "stop the nuclear programming on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea wanted to end the famous 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first stop developing nuclear weapons.
Washington has refused to agree to ease the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
It said: "The US continues to insist that 'we must first stop building nuclear weapons' and increases the level of pressure and sanctions to achieve their goal through force, despite its refusal to 'declare an end to the war.'"
"The idea that punishment can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream for a society that ignores us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are building up our confidence in them".
Ri made no announcement about the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US president reiterated at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months and said: "If the country that was concerned about this denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have stopped".
And Ri's tone was strikingly different from the one he had a year earlier, when he spoke at the UN General Assembly about the possibility of a Korean missile attack on the US after "the evil President" Trump called Kim a "suicide bomber".
At this year's UN summit, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his determination to take the step of denuclearizing, but said more needed to be done and sanctions would be maintained until North Korea stopped denuclearizing.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have time to do so, saying "If it takes two years, three years or three months; it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have been arguing with the UN Security Council that it should compensate the Pyongyang government for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's reinforcement of sanctions must continue in a robust and unrelenting manner until it is demonstrated that the nuclear deterrent has been fully, promptly and thoroughly removed".
The Security Council unanimously voted to extend sanctions against North Korea from 2006 to prevent the government from funding Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at a side-by-side meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his most recent visit was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July to claim a step forward, which North Korea denied hours later, declaring that "the demands are like gangs".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to destroy its missile and nuclear facilities if the US "takes similar action".
He said Kim told him that "similar measures" he wanted to see taken were security guarantees under the Trump agreement in Singapore and he was continuing to improve relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a rest-based course.
A new study from Harvard University this year recommended that all undergraduates get enough sleep to combat the growing male trend of studying 'all night long' with caffeine.
A university worker found that top students at a university often lack basic information about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of starting a class after giving a talk on the effects of poor sleep on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, when I'm in my last year of high school?'
She says no one has ever told her the importance of sleep, which surprised me,' she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced, explains to students the basics of how getting enough sleep helps students and athletes behave better, and improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief medical officer, said the university decided to introduce the course after students went without sleep for a week.
The one-hour class includes a variety of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and are told that the effects of caffeine and light are that sleep deprivation affects performance and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another study, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The university map, with its informative graphics, encourages participants to reflect on their activities on a permanent basis.
'We know that it does not change students' behaviour immediately.
"But we believe they have a right to know", says Professor Czeisler, "just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke".
There is still a tendency to insist on 'night' schooling', she adds, adding that the increasing pressure of modern technology on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough, good quality sleep should be a 'secret weapon' for students to combat stress, anxiety and stress; and to prevent weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a starvation mode, keeping it hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California biochemist, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, having taken his course the previous year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the lesson was eye-opening and made him want to teach it at any university.
He believes the next step is to require graduates to complete certain courses before entering the job market.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting alarm clock to alert them to bedtime and wake up time and to alert them to hazards such as blue light from LED lights and LED lights, which can cause sleep disturbances and sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal was a disappointment to Gerrard's coaching staff
Rangers were again made to look as Dolly Menga's goal defeated Steven Gerrard's side 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox looked set to win for the first time since their 4-1 defeat to St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard's side for the second time in 18 games as manager to leave his side behind Ladbrokes in the Championship by points behind Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time to put the Rangers on a losing streak.
While Rangers are now relegated to sixth place, Livingston have moved up to third place and are behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more questions ahead for the Rangers after the sideman, Calum Spence, was diagnosed with a head injury after what appeared to be a long-range hit.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances in the win over Ayr to advance to the semi-finals of the Red Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, took 11 Livi players to Hearts last week and was pleased that his side had kept their opponents out of the game.
Rangers may have been very special on the ball but Livingston was productive on the few balls they had.
They won within minutes when Menga's first ball was passed to Scott Pittman in Allan McGregor's backfield but the midfielder had a chance to throw the ball out.
The opening ball was thrown into the net by Keaghan Jacobs who found the defender, Craig Halkett, but the fullback Alan Lithgow threw the ball out of the net.
Rangers led the game but it looked like they should have done more than hope given their performance in the third quarter.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly felt he deserved a penalty in the seventy-fifth minute when he faced Steven Lawless but the referee, Steven Thomson, refused to take into account the Colombian's approach.
Rangers managed just two shots into the back of the net in the first half but former Ibrox defender Liam Kelly was not deterred by a header from Lassana Coulibaly and a poor shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's first goal was scored in the 34th minute, it is undeniable that they should have scored the goal as planned.
The Rangers again failed to recover a field goal from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not touch the ball that was thrown by Declan Gallagher and passed it to Scott Robinson, who did nothing to stop the ball being easily brought into the defence by Menga.
Gerrard made a late-inning substitution for Ryan Kent, which was almost instantaneous when Morelos was handed the ball to the striker, but Kelly ran well and stopped the ball.
But Livingston continued to resist the visiting team's regular game, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to pitch long balls.
Holt's side scored another goal in the final minutes but McGregor stood up to block Jacobs' shot as Lithgow threw a header out.
Rangers replaced Glenn Middleton who suggested a penalty shoot-out against Jacobs but was again ignored by referee Thomson.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
Even our Sunday Morning Almanac page: September 30, 1882, 136 days ago today and we still remember it... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring the release of chemical particles, which led to the invention of the Geiger Counter.
The instrument has since been scientifically based, and the Geiger Counter has also become a popular entertainment device, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring science fiction actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Husband: "What is that thing?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to detect gems that contain toxic particles like uranium.
If you give me these equators, you can clearly hear the atomic changes emitted by the toxic particles in these gems".
Evans: "They're starting to jump!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device that bears his name still exists.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to 'find' malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine may train the immune system to "find" malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize malignant stem cells as part of a treatment.
This technique involves removing cells that help build the patient's immune system and making them into cells in the laboratory
They can then 'find' a protein that is commonly found in many cancers and re-implant it into the body.
The trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who received a vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize malignant cells, was cured of her cervical cancer after 18 months.
The technique involves removing cells from a patient, converting them in a laboratory to "identify" a protein found in many cancers called HER2 and re-implanting the cells.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", says Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Berzofsky explains that HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
One method of removing immune cells from a patient and "training" those cells to attack cancer cells has been used to treat leukemia.
Kanye West made a statement praising Trump supporters, wearing a hat with MAGA on it, after appearing on SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after he sang obscene songs praising US President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election.
After performing her third song of the night, she called Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great hat, attacked Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"Too often I talk about white people, they say, 'How can you love Trump, you idiot?'
"I mean, if I'm worried about race, I left America a long time ago".
SNL's opening segment featured a satirical comedy starring Hollywood actor Matt Damon who ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee's handling of a sexual harassment complaint filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not reported in the press, videos of West's remarks were posted online by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to criticize West based on his postings.
And West complained that the audience said a lot of things from behind the stage about the hat he was wearing.
"I was thrown out of the platform.
They said, 'Don't go on stage with that hat on'
They've got me!
"They said I was not standing", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
"You want to see me stand up?" West continues, "put on a soapbox, because it means you don't tell me what to do.
Try to love each other".
Her comments led to at least two rounds of screaming from the audience and SNL's apparent embarrassment, according to Variety, with one person telling the magazine: "The whole studio went into a tailspin".
West was last seen as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West made a number of appearances on the song "I Love It", where he wore a Perrier hat.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the most passionate people: You have done a great job of standing up to the revolutionaries".
But host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West is "expressing who he really is and it's great".
"But I chose NOT to pay someone (by buying their music or clothes to promote their 'art') who I believe is embracing and spreading ideas that are harmful to the communities in which I live.
He got out.
He continues: We are also free.
Before the concert, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and has been followed by others to do so, including Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper partner Snoop Dogg used the name Snoop Lion and the recently deceased rapper Prince, who changed his name to Prince, used the logo.
Charges of attempted murder with stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The problems originated in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast County Court on Monday.
The charges against him will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington has condemned the bad habits of the kibago.
Kit Harington is best known for playing the swordsmith Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy-adventure series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has rejected discrimination based on the hero's masculine appearance, saying his acting means that teenagers often feel they have to push themselves to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believed 'something was wrong' and wondered how she could address male bias as the #Me campaign was launched.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "very empowered" about problem solving.
'I feel very strong now,' he said, 'and I wonder where the male characteristic came from?'
'What if we educate men when they grow up about the problems we are facing today?'
Kit believes that television may be a contributing factor in the rise of male infertility due to the increasingly male-dominated portrayal of actors.
He continues: "What is man born and what is his learning?
What is taught on television and what is taught on the street that makes teenagers feel that they have a part in becoming men?
I think that's the most important question of our time: How do we change this?
Because clearly something is wrong with our youth.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he could not play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ended this summer, saying he "didn't want the war and the horse riding anymore".
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's upcoming True West, a film about his brother's thieving ways.
The actor recently announced that he considers meeting his wife, Rose, the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
He said: 'I met my wife while we were doing a drama, so they gave me my future family and my new life from now on.'
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's favorite character played by Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning drama series based on the novels.
They married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslie family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China reported a 14% increase in the number of its HIV-positive and HIV-positive population.
More than 820,000 cases have been reported in the country, according to health officials.
Almost 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A large number of new infections are due to sexual contact, which is different from what has been the case in the past.
HIV is normally transmitted rapidly in some parts of China through donation of infected blood.
But the number of new HIV infections in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of HIV-positive people and AIDS cases in China is increasing by 100,000 people a year.
Sexually transmitted infection (STI) is a major problem for gay people in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals has been on the rise.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of gay men eventually marry women.
Most cases of the disease are caused by unprotected sexual intercourse in the marriage.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV drugs widely available as part of its response to the epidemic.
Maxine Waters denied that a Republican senator's report released by a staff member was a "troublesome lie" and a "malign plot".
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff members published the personal information of Republican senators on the lawmakers' pages on Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat said the measure is being pushed back by the debate makers and is "very Republican".
Waters said in a statement on Twitter that it was: "Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies".
The leaked information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information, which was posted online on Thursday, was reported by an unidentified source on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The news came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Hill reports: Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that indicates the source of the data is associated with the Waters office and that it has reported information from one of the Waters employees.
"These accusations are baseless and not true at all", Watera continues, "but simply false".
"One of my employees, whose identity, privacy and security were compromised due to allegations of fraud and misrepresentation, was not responsible for releasing this information.
These accusations are baseless and completely untrue, but they are simply false".
Waters' comments prompted widespread online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outrageous", says Fleischer.
"It shows that he has no desire to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not object to the authority's doing its work.
He should not ask why the accuser is accusing him.
He needs to be quiet and calm".
Fleischer was forced to compare Waters' response to the allegations to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was also accused by critics of appearing angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate vying to remove Waters from office in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It would be terrible if it were true", he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said his office had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies that are investigating what he described as fraud.
"We will ensure that those responsible are identified", he added, "and that they are held legally accountable for any actions that are damaging or harmful to all my employees".
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, not strong enough to play a comedian
It is now common to see the benefits of Britain leaving the European Union as a new film about Britain and it seems possible that this new film in the Johnny English series will be a comedy-drama; it was first released in 2003 as Johnny English and then re-released in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Is a comedy-drama film about a non-fiction subject going to show our potential as a country in terms of export opportunities?
In any case, the brittle, disabled, aging actor Johnny English was eligible for a second chance at the title, his most recognizable title being a comedy-drama for non-English-speaking audiences.
He plays a secret agent who is made to look funny to show off Clouseau's childhood appearance, which is as good as Mr. Bean's, and he has gone as far as Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
Originally, it was based on the character and persona of Atkinson, a former Barclaycard TV commercial star who is now perhaps forgotten, and who causes a stir.
There are two good times in the JE edition.
I loved the way Johnny English approached the helicopter while wearing a 500-pounder suit and a sharp helicopter sword that touched his helmet slightly.
Atkinson's gift for body comedy is highly visible, but his laughter seems weak and unusual in the context of the comedy-drama genre, especially in popular films like 007 and Mission Impossible where the "self-aware" actors themselves play comedy as an extra.
The humor seems to be aimed at young children rather than adults and Johnny English's unusual crazy acts are not inventive and focus on Atkinson's films in which he does not utter a single word as Bean.
The most common story was that Britain was in grave danger.
A computer thief infiltrates a major British spy ring, revealing the identities of all British spy agents who would be assigned to various locations, including an actor who is shown on duty but unfortunately is given a small role called Kevin Eldon.
This was a challenge for the arrogant and competitive Prime Minister, who is in the midst of a potentially unpopular political career: Emma Thompson has a good role where she is going to be Teresa-May but there is not much to be done.
His intelligence advisers told him that the spy was everywhere and that it was necessary that someone should retire.
And it means that there is no one but Johnny English, who at the moment has a teaching job at a high-end school, but he is teaching extracurricular classes where he is teaching how to be a spy: That's good advice where English is teaching a rock school class on espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall where he must receive urgent instructions and reconnect with his former colleague Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is pregnant and married to a submarine captain, a role played by Vicki Pepperdine but not for the production.
So it is Batman and Robin who play the most dangerous things in the Queen's Secret Service, meeting a tough woman who works for Olga Kurylenko named Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister was about to fall for a billionaire technologist who claims he can solve the UK's computer crisis: a down-on-his-luck Jason Volta, a drinking buddy of Jake Lacy.
English begins Bough's difficult journey of extreme disguise: they hire waiters, serve at a French restaurant; they cause a stir by trying to sneak onto the expensive Volta cruise ship; and English takes matters into his own hands when he tries to use the unreal toys to train inside Volta's house.
All of this is played out in the final scene of the movie, but as fun and intense as it is, there is a children's television show that shows it all.
It is very common.
And so all the other Johnny English movies are where I can't stop thinking: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a good acting rival to showcase her talent?
Labour denies it is considering a plan for Britain to work four days a week and get paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party is considering a major policy that would leave all Britons working four days a week, but getting paid five days.
The party says it wants executives from various companies to look for ways to save money through the development of artificial intelligence (AI) for employees to get an extra day off.
It can leave employees enjoying a three-day weekend, but still getting paid the same amount they were paid.
The idea is described by the media as "suitable" for the economic policy of the party and aims to bring about changes that will benefit the country's workers.
The shift was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way to make workers more productive in the face of economic change.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "The review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
'It is not a one-day thing but a four-day workweek is the ideal ideal for a Party's way of regulating the economy in the interests of workers and the policies of the Party in the industry as a whole.'
Labour may not be the first to support the idea, with the environmentalist party promising a four-day workweek as part of a wider campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this request is not yet supported by all Labour Party members.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not a party policy and will not be considered by the party".
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to articulate his stance on socialist economic change.
Mr McDonnell said he was committed to reclaiming the power stolen by "faceless leaders" and "crowded-out water, gas and electricity companies".
The deputy chancellor's plans also suggest that water partners may not fully support his plan while the Labour government 'cut costs' based on perceived malpractices.
He also announced plans to appoint employees to the company's board of directors and set up an inclusive ownership fund to provide 10 percent of the shares in the employee-owned companies, with each company expected to receive a share of the profits of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the criminal charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been delayed by more than a week in the run-up to the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination, and questions have been raised as to whether the agency's findings could sway Republican senators.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI might have something to say that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more relaxed than his South Carolina counterpart.
"That's right", said Kennedy.
"I spoke about going to trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and I said that his accusations were true, 'You did it?'
He was true to his word, determined, and well-informed".
However, Graham's election seemed to have been confirmed.
"I have reached a decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and I intend to take action to dismiss the charges against him", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied it wholeheartedly", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone says they can't control it.
These are allegations from 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new that can change".
Has the Global Citizen Festival also helped to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring celebrity singers and entertainers with a compelling mission to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival draws thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy the work of such luminaries as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to campaign for the festival's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a complementary project to the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty and increase the number of people living in poverty.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you prefer to pay for an honorary ticket), participants must perform various tasks or "activities" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls, or other meaningful ways to help campaign for their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how does Global Citizen get there with 12 years to go?
Is the idea of paying people to attend a free concert a good way to get people to demand action or is it just another "click-and-call" campaign where people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have documented 19 million "actions" by its supporters, leading to various causes.
It says these efforts have helped to prompt world leaders to announce guidelines and measures worth US$37 billion aimed at improving the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has committed to 390 projects with at least US$10 billion donated or raised.
The group estimates that the support received so far has directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the initiatives were a partnership with The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based business association and policy maker committed to "helping children reach their full potential", pledging US$35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can end social inequality as history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at an instantaneous concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 campaigns to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced it would fund the Power of Nutrition initiative, which will reach 5 million women and children who will receive nutritional support.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, it asks: "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey; sometimes it will involve falling and hitting the target.
But as the great human rights and anti-apartheid revolutions in South Africa took place before we started, we will reach the summit, because together we are stronger.
Artists including Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's New York concert, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use warships to "lock down" and prevent Russian forces from sending in foreign troops, says the Home Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" decide to use its warships to block Russian gas from reaching various markets, including the Middle East, said Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke accused Russia of interfering in the Syrian conflict, largely at the invitation of the legitimate government, but as a pretext to seek new sources of gas.
He was quoted as saying: "I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to have a gas source as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe".
And according to the authorities, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our warships, to work to open up and if necessary close down the sea lanes to ensure that their gas does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the voice of the gas consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's tactics against Russia and Iran, saying that the two countries are not the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are, almost, energy and oil substitution", he said, referring to Russia as a "tricky horse" with an oil-based economy.
The comments came after the Trump administration plans to increase the volume of liquefied natural gas in Europe, replacing Russia, which is a cheap supplier of gas to Europe.
Thus, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "failed" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "pledge" to Moscow.
Moscow has also announced its support for the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is expected to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, with no other objective than to be an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's complete disapproval of the project is based largely on economic considerations and is a good example of market neutrality.
"I believe we can all agree that gas cannot be a tool to place a side in the shadow and that users should be able to choose their own suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was not well received by Germany, which reiterated its support for the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), a leading German industrial organization, called for the United States to refrain from any approach to EU energy policy and the Berlin-Moscow accords.
"I have a serious problem when a third country interferes with our gas supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said recently at a joint meeting of Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she should "consider seriously" running for president after the midterm elections.
At a rally at the Holyoke, Massachusetts, convention center, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and support our divided government with a woman in charge", she said, according to The Hill.
"After December 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump at a House of Representatives rally, calling him "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has come back strongly critical of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
"We really need the FBI to investigate before the election", Warren said in a tweet on Friday.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most voters in Warren's home district did not think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "eligible" voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported his candidacy.
The poll showed strong support from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed as potential candidates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he could make a formal decision in January, The Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaks about the track Palin's depression in the campaign of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq as a member of the September draft.
She was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he has been through, I can relate to that other families are underestimating the severity of the trauma and injuries our troops are going through", she told Donald Trump's campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her arrest as "a case of misplaced responsibility" and said her son and other veterans "come back different, come back injured, come back wondering if there is any honor given to fellow soldiers and airmen and even to each soldier for their service to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and battery, obstruction of justice for domestic violence and possession of a firearm while in possession of drugs, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a new asylum denial measure
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported a lawsuit that blocks the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories filed a summary of the court's rulings on Friday in Washington to block the asylum seekers' actions, according to NBC News.
All the names of the plaintiffs in favor of Grace v. Sessions state that the complaint filed in August by American Civil Liberties Unionfiled against the government's actions was never made public.
She said her boyfriend "and her gang members" had harassed her but that US authorities had denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Government advocates for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which account for the largest number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries with high levels of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Service that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Chief Judge of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new measures "ignore decades of federal, state and international laws".
"National law requires that all claims for asylum be processed on the basis of specific information and that the claim was made and the new measures implemented go beyond that combination", the court's brief stated.
The judges continued to argue in the brief that immigration restrictions are a threat to the US economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurial and "provide essential employment".
In June, Chief Justice Jeff Sessions recommended that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
In his June 11 statement on the measures, Sessions said: "Asylum is granted to those who leave their country of origin because of a well-founded fear of persecution or discrimination based on race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion".
Asylum is not intended to reduce the severity of the problem; however serious the problem may be, people face it every day around the world.
Mass rescue operations in Palu as death toll doubles in swift search for survivors
For the survivors, the problems grew as the hours passed.
"I feel very bad", said Risa Kusuma, 35, who was taking her son to a rescue centre after he caught fire.
"Every minute, the ambulance arrives with bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
The inhabitants who emerged would return to their destroyed homes, grab their flooded belongings, and try to find something to live on.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed by the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, lying outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuous small earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the events that followed the powerful quake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and child.
"We had no time to flee.
I was bored with the ruins, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then she stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'obstructionism' by using propaganda campaigns
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper boasting of profitable trade with China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US newspaper to promote its own policies.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump criticized the overpayment of the Des Moines Register by China Daily, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing interfered in the US election reflects what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a new level of Washington's strategy to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to use advertising to promote their business, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that has reached the point where they have imposed tariffs on each other's imports.
China has also retaliated with tariffs that triggered a trade war that was supposed to target Iowa exporters that supported Trump's Republican Party, according to an expert on Sino-US relations.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing was a threat to US farmers, ranchers and businesses.
"China has now stepped up its non-interference and anti-communist ads in our independent press", Branstad wrote in a commentary in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
Branstad said: "In an effort to expand its influence, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the US tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register".
"In contrast, on newsstands selling newspapers on the streets of Beijing, you see comments from those who are unhappy with the government's actions but you don't see a real picture of the various views that China may be on a troubled economic path because the media is controlled by the ruling Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the major newspapers in China has escaped the rush to cover" his story, though he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts would have warned that Republicans would be distancing themselves from women voters just before the midterm elections and Kavanaugh Debacle.
While many Republican leaders expected and would support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple sexual assault charges, a commentator warned that their actions would not be well received; particularly, by women, in the run-up to the midterm elections.
The sentiment surrounding the issue is overwhelming and many Republicans have already expressed their desire for the election to go ahead.
These things cannot be undone", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (Republican from Arizona) last-minute announcement for an FBI investigation would be enough to quell the anger of angry voters.
"Women will never forget yesterday; they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the advocacy group MoveOn, said Friday, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper report.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is here!" as they marched through the Senate floor as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee voted to continue approving Kavanaugh's nomination despite a veto by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst who is a member, told the news site: "The Democratic Party is at the top of their game".
"People would say it's a high level, and it's true.
But it can go much higher; especially among women who are unsure who to vote for in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president, they often don't vote".
Although Ford made clear before his public testimony how he was being sexually harassed by his nominee, critics said the situation could not be better received as Republicans pressed for his confirmation.
"This was a disconcerting upheaval in the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former executive director of the Republican National Committee, said in a news release from NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not about committee elections or by-elections or whether Kavanaugh gets seated, it's about how Republicans respond to this issue and how they respond to him", said Guy Cecil, executive director of Priorities USA, a Democratic election advocacy group, in a news release.
However, Americans seem to be divided over who to trust after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony, with the majority favoring the latter's testimony.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents doubt or might trust Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they doubt or might trust Kavanaugh's testimony.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have been lying in his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's call for action, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had drunk and raped her when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court nominee of showing off his manhood at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is going to start a company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech giant, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Open Source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to access the data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to "take over the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the company he is launching.
"This is a historic moment".
The software uses Solid technology to allow users to install a "personal online database" or POD.
It can include a mailing list, to-do list, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional resources.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of this online private database is that it is up to the user to determine the extent to which they can access certain information.
The company calls it "empowering individuals through information".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring in the best capabilities, processes and knowledge to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security software company brought in by IBM, some software staff who have been contracted to work on various projects and a network of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, developers around the world can download virtual network applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce changes where their business model could be completed as soon as possible.
"We are not asking for a new one".
In a statement on Medium released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "is intended to provide the business power and connectivity to help ensure the integrity and integrity of a new platform built using Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Forum at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become a revolutionary voice in the debate over the Internet's independence.
While he founded Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the future of international computing", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: One of the recipients of the WW1 Victoria Cross was ceremoniously
A Church of England clergyman who was awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War as a soldier was given a state funeral in the city 100 years after his retirement.
Lieutenant Colonel Revera Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 for the Battle of Bellenglise and the Battle of Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest decoration in the British Army.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was erected by his two grandchildren at a memorial service in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "a very good sign" that the stone was properly lit 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather his first major medal.
According to the London Gazette, 29 September 1918; Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin tunnel "through thick fog and was being bombarded with heavy ground and machine-gun fire".
He then rushed to the battlefield and with "great courage" led his troops to continue to advance and defeat the enemy until he himself defeated three opposing armies.
The Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's work was "something I know I could never do because it makes him humble".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also laid flowers at the cemetery after the funeral, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
"I feel very proud to have been part of this journey", said Michael Vann, adding that "the true strength of a hero is shown by the support of many people".
MMA fans spent the night awake waiting for Bellator 206 to play, instead watching the hit animated series Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you spent the night up watching the boxing match of Bellator 206 and ended up missing the highly anticipated fight.
The San Jose schedule was for 13 matches, including the six most anticipated and was shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, British television viewers were stunned when the shark they were watching turned into the giant Peppa Pig.
Some were not happy with what happened after they spent the night awake until the early hours of the morning mostly waiting for the battle.
One Twitter fan described the change to show children's tents as "a senseless joke".
"It was the state policy that 6:00 a.m. shows were inappropriate when they were changed to include children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of media and communications, when asked about the videos.
""Peppa the pig", yes".
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would be making changes to their schedule including UK TV viewership in the coming days.
"I think when I think about seeing the war over, I think maybe they can do something about it", Coker said.
"But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday when I leave and we can't change it until Sunday at our time, which is Monday at their time.
But we are going to do something about it.
Believe me, when I translated the shena there were many articles that came back and not all of them were good news.
We were trying to fix it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case. It was a government issue.
I promise you that it will not happen again.
We will split it into five matches instead of six; as usual we did and we tried to give our fans as much as we could and we got over it.
It was a tragedy".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'humiliated' about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling humiliated by everyone because of his gender, but it inspired him to achieve.
The 24-year-old actress said she didn't realize it until she was in high school and realized "not everyone is like me".
First appearing on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
She also said that being a mother made her focus less on winning Olympic medals.
The long-running talk show host, Kirsty Young, had taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on the first episode of Laverne, Daley said that she felt "inferior" to other teenagers because "it was not acceptable in the family to love boys and girls".
"To this day", he says, "that feeling of inferiority and of being different has been a powerful source of strength and motivation for me to achieve".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", so that no one would be disappointed when he learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known gay activist and has used participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he put it aside because he felt he had the opportunity to live freely and without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that dating American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "surprised" her.
Daley married Oscar winner, who is 20 years her senior, last year but says the age difference was never an issue.
"You go through a lot at a young age", she said, noting that she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her biological father died of cancer three days later, saying it was hard to find a peer with the same experience.
The couple became parents in June, giving birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his thoughts" changed.
"If you asked me last year what I wanted most in life, I would have said, 'I want to win a gold medal.'"
"You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father never accepted that he was dying and that his last request was not for their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics; he wanted them to sit in the front seats.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You can't sit in the front seat, Dad.'
"I was holding his hands when he took his last breath and it was only after he took his last breath that I was convinced he was dead and that he was not injured", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life, to perform in front of my country's fans at the Olympics, there was no greater emotion", she said.
It also gave her the idea for her first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which became a worldwide hit as she prepared for the Olympics and became a table top.

Retired player Mickelson was named a reserve for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will break the record on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will need to improve his performance to avoid missing out on the podium.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th biennial, was named a substitute by captain Jim Furyk in a four-ball-on-a-side match on Saturday.
Rather than doing the basic chores as is often the case in the United States, the winner of five major championships splits his day between sitting on the bench and working to make sure his game is going well to fix what went wrong.
Not playing very well despite reaching the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not physically fit to play in Le Golf National, where poor shooters are often dismissed.
And if the performance alone is not enough, Mickelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who battled rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are still four points from 12 games each, start the tournament strongly, Mickelson's game could be a very important one.
Furyk expressed confidence in the man, although he could not say much more.
Furyk recalls: "He understood his role today, patted me on the back and put his arm around me and told me that he was ready for tomorrow".
"He is very confident.
He is one of the most famous players and has made a huge contribution to these teams in the past few days and this week.
I never thought he could play two games.
I had seen a lot more, but the way it happened and the way we thought it would happen.
He wants to play like everybody else".
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
It may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has been far from his personal best.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven, although Furyk said his presence made the team valuable.
"He is funny, slow, intelligent, a bit of a gossip", she explains, "and a good man to have on the team".
"I think the young players enjoyed being with him, and it was good to see this week.
He gives more than he plays".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leading with a high score can quickly be a loss.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows that leading with a high score until the final day of a single player's Ryder Cup match can easily turn bad.
The Danes started the 1997 season in Valderrama, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros led by five points over the Americans but finished just a few points ahead, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were leading by a lot of points in Valderrama; we were leading in Brookline, where he lost, and in Valderrama, where he won, but that's it", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 players win 5-3 in Friday's games and 10-6 in the Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and others in the team that it is not over.
But you will use all your energy tomorrow.
Go out and do only good.
It was not over until you got the score written on the board.
Our goal is also to try to win this cup, which is where we are focused.
I've said it for a long time, I can focus on the 12 players on our side, but we know what we have ahead of us on the other side; the world's best players".
Bjorn adds that he is pleased that my players played on a difficult golf course: "I can't come forward on my own in these competitions.
Tomorrow is even worse.
Tomorrow is an individual role to be played and it is the difference between what we should do.
It's good to be with your partner when things are going well, but when you're playing on your own, then try your best as a golfer.
This is the message you have to send to the players, and it is to make them give their best tomorrow.
So now leave your plow behind and go sow for yourself and for your harvest.'
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will wear a different size and will determine how his players behave to play better individually than they did with their teammates, most notably Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the final day of competition, where he was part of the team that won the Brookline before losing as Europe withdrew from the "Miracle at Medinah" competition.
"I remember how every word did it", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, helped the players to the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start quickly as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When the force is in one direction, it overshadows the midfield players.
We're putting players in the game and we're putting players out in a way that we feel like we're going to like, you know, we're trying to do great things tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the team to a single elimination and face Rory McIlroy in a matchup, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the front row of the competition.
Bjorn says of the selection of players for the one-player mode: "I went with this team in the next step because I think it has all the players that will be useful".
A new German warship changes time again.
The new German warship was authorized to enter service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war ships, but was not available until at least the next year due to poor systems and high costs, according to local media.
The authorization to sail the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, was postponed until early 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was also ordered to replace the other warships in 2014, but problems with the shipping of the ships put the ambitious project on hold.
The Baden-Wuerttemberg-class submarines were ordered by the German Navy in 2007 to replace the aging Bremen-class submarines.
It must, of course, have powerful missiles, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and advanced underwater technologies such as radar-deflection, infrared signals, and hearing and sound recorders.
Another important feature of these vessels is that they are repaired after a long period of time, and it should be possible to have new vessels put to sea for at least two years from a non-native port.
However, the continued delay means that ships are equipped with advanced technology, which has been suggested to give Germany a potential roadmap that will be outdated once it is in service, Die Zeit reports.
The F125's untimely demise was brought to the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to allow the ship to go to sea and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned a ship to its manufacturer after it was decommissioned.
The exact reason for the re-entry is unknown, but German media reported that several serious "program and machinery" flaws had prevented the ship from being sent to the front.
In particular, the programming flaws were particularly acute when the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships were to be operated by a crew of 120, a subset of the crew of the older Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship was incredibly heavy, which reduced its performance and reduced the naval capability of the fleet with future additions to the fleet.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighing 7,000 tons is estimated to be twice the weight of the German battleship of the same type used in World War II.
In addition to the defective machinery, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the sailors, will also be a problem.
It is reported to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with these new types of ships are coming under intense scrutiny amid recent concerns about the declining strength of the German Navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy was currently "lacking ships for attack".
The problem, he said, has grown over time, as older ships have been retired but no replacements have been delivered.
He complained that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships had been able to join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the private lives of the little ones.
New research is being conducted in a facility in the Scottish Highlands to investigate how bats use the mountains to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results of this study will provide a clearer picture of the unique behaviour of the flying mammals and help to understand how to manage their residues.
Research by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bats and the untamed bats as well as the long-eared bat and the Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special sound recorders will be installed in key locations throughout the building to monitor the activity of the roads throughout the year.
A NHS staff member and volunteer will also conduct research on the move using hand-held bats sensors.
A sound analysis by a sound recorder specialist will determine the language the bats are communicating with and the type of bats performing certain actions.
A map of the bat's habitat and reports will be provided to provide a detailed picture of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, believes the results will reveal habitats that are particularly important for bats and are used by all species of bats.
This article will help to understand the benefits of managing bat habitat such as grassland for insects, leaving behind trees for bats and other closely related species.
Bats in Scotland and England have been in dramatic decline over the past century.
We are being hit by the destruction of our infrastructure and development projects and the lack of housing.
Wind turbines and lightning can also cause problems with wind-blown paper and some chemicals in building materials and the risk of domestic cats.
Bats are normally sighted.
However, because they usually hunt at night, their ears are more important than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
We use sound-based positioning technology to determine the precise location of insects and the obstacles they face in flight.
The NTS, which manages more than 270 historic buildings, 38 national parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has a strong interest in bats.
It has ten trained specialists who conduct continuous research, monitor predators and occasionally rescue bats.
The family also established a specialised bat facility in Scotland, the first dedicated to bats, at the Threave Museum in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of bats found in Scotland.
According to building inspector David Thompson, the building is a perfect habitat for bats.
"Here in Threave, there is a beautiful area for bats".
"We have nice buildings, big trees, and a nice place for bats to nest.
But there is so much that was unknown about bats, so our work here and in other facilities is to help us understand more about what we need to survive".
He emphasizes the importance of bat checks before building renovations because demolishing a bat shelter without first looking can kill up to 400 young female bats, saving the entire species.
Bats are also protected from killing, eating, harming or destroying their prey.
Elisabeth Ferrell, director of the Bat Conservation Trust, Scotland, urged the public to come and help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and many of our species don't know what bats are like".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "rumors", saying people "want to make themselves known" using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported on the allegations.
A Portuguese international and Juventus player has been charged with the rape of American actress Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the claims as "rumors".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they said today, is a rumor", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to be known by my name.
It is normal.
They want to be recognized by saying my name, but it's part of our job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the actor added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers were preparing to sue the newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations, for what they called "unauthorized disclosure of suspected privacy claims", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the actor was seeking compensation for "the damage to his reputation due to the gravity of the injustice, which is probably the biggest human rights violation in years".
The alleged abuse took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly reunited in the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the hip, according to documents filed by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt after the incident and told him that "99 percent" was "a good person" and that he was disappointed by "one percent".
Records show that Ronaldo admitted that the two had consensual sex.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries while in the hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter without going to court because she felt "fear of violence" and was also worried about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old model says she is now trying to change the deal as she continues to be distracted by the incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United in a rumored move and moved to Juve for €100 million this summer.
Brexit: Britain 'could regret forever' after losing its car industry
Britain "may regret forever" losing its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after leaving the EU, says Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He added: "It is with concern that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily suspend production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need to understand", Clark said.
A Japanese car manufacturer warned that delays at the border would have a negative impact if there was no agreement when the UK was out of the EU, leading to a significant loss of jobs.
Burnaston, the manufacturer of Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, with 90% of those exported to the EU.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will have a car factory", said Marvin Cooke, head of Toyota's Burnaston plant.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about a no-deal exit from the EU, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close a small factory in Oxford one month after the UK leaves the European Union.
A major concern is that carmakers are claiming that their accessories are being sold to troubled customers amid the uncertainty following the UK's exit from the European Union.
Toyota is working on a strategy to "reduce production time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for production of imported vehicles.
When the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a suspension of operations over a dispute that the industry says could lead to delays and supply shortages.
It is highly unlikely that Toyota would stock a day's worth of cars in its warehouse at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and could halt production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan to leave the EU included provisions for relations with the EU "that have been made to avoid strong border controls".
"We need to make a deal", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We want to make a good deal that not only achieves the goals this year but also enables us to take advantage of those opportunities".
"It is clear that not only Toyota but other car manufacturers need to be able to maintain a high level of supply and cost of products that meet their targets".
Toyota was unable to say when production would stop, but in the long run, it warned that rising prices would reduce the company's competitiveness in the market and not lead to a large job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union at the plant, says his family members remain concerned: "In my view, once some jobs are taken away, they never come back.
"We must establish a stable and credible framework for our future relationship with the EU", a government spokesman said.
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, US Presidential Office says
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" as the race for the top vaccine nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump-Russia contacts and the president's obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump would fire the top diplomat, and whether it would jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been a topic of discussion in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been wearing a hearing aid to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of impeachment under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the reports.
But last Monday, he went to the US Presidential Office, and there were rumors that he might resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was held at the UN headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the reconciliation meeting was postponed because he avoided a meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee on the trial where Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump requested an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, further delaying the Senate primary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It is an unconfirmed date, probably this month, it could be postponed another week due to other developments in the Supreme Court.
But we will all see how it goes and I will keep the media updated".
Some journalists disagree with the report: Sanders has not called a meeting in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace wondered why.
Sanders said the lack of new media was not due to a dislike of television journalists "because of their inappropriate behavior", though he added: "I disagree with him because he says they behave inappropriately".
He then said that direct communication between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president has more time to be questioned and answered than any president before him", he said, adding that he had already said without proof: "We looked at the statistics".
News conferences are still a rarity, according to Sanders, but "when the media gets a chance to directly interview the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this more often and you've seen us do it in the last few weeks and it will take time for me to update when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Normally, Trump accepts questions when he is leaving the US Presidential Office or attending a recent interview or a press conference with a visiting dignitary.
Even a private interview with the media is rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, by breaking the law and sometimes appearing in unusual ways in front of a gathering of reporters.
The Secretary of State for Health wrote to EU staff at NHS Scotland about fears that the UK was about to leave the EU.
The Secretary of State for Health wrote to EU staff at the NHS in Scotland expressing their national appreciation and wishes for them to remain in service after the UK leaves the EU.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's exit from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the cost of EU citizens working for its services being suspended.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "In the summer, talks between the UK and the EU on the EU exit process continued, discussing a resolution expected this autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up its preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know these are very difficult times for all of us.
So I wanted to talk about it again today, and show how I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
My colleagues from EU Member States bring experience and practical knowledge that enhances and enhances the quality of healthcare services and is of benefit to the patients and families we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home, and we would like you to stay".
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee State spokesman Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half break.
"He came over to the side and fell", says Reed.
Coaches and paramedics added oxygen to Abercrombie's side of the field before putting him on the bench and taking him for further testing.
A Tennessee State staff member told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no explanation was available as to the nature/duration of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, was in his first year playing for Tennessee State after being acquired from Illinois.
On Sunday, he took a tackle before leaving the game, where b made 18 total tackles.
Foreign buyers will be taxed more heavily on government documents when they buy immovable property in the UK.
Foreign buyers are charged higher taxes on their property when they buy immovable property in the UK, with the surplus money being used to help the homeless under new policies by British politicians.
This is to prevent Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters from voting.
Tax on government-issued documents will be charged to non-taxpayers in the UK.
The state treasurer plans to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are charged higher taxes on their property purchases in the UK, with the surplus going to homelessness, Theresa May announced today.
The scheme appears to be an attempt to disrupt Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with the promise of cheap housing and higher taxes for those who work harder.
Increasing taxes on government-issued documents for individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, where the surplus funds are intended to strengthen the government's strategy against homelessness, is appropriate.
The higher taxes, in addition to existing government taxes, include a two-year increase in the rate of taxation for second home buyers and renters to 3 percent.
The state treasurer expects the scheme to raise £120 million a year.
The 13th highest proportion of newly built homes in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, increasing prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to live in.
Many of the country's affluent areas, especially the capital, have become "unpopulated cities" because large numbers of foreign buyers of real estate spend a lot of time outside the country.
The new measures come weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in federal property taxes to help young people own their own homes.
He blamed large construction companies for keeping house prices high on land that was being plundered but not used, and urged Mrs May to allow lower taxes on low-cost housing to tackle "suspicious housing" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a number of exciting proposals for reform, including controlling rent and ending the tendency of private landlords to "evict tenants without good reason".
He also wants to give the council more power to build new buildings.
"Last year I said I would put a lot of effort into reviving the British Dream, which is to create a better life for each new generation", said Mrs May.
And that means we have to solve the problems that are present in the housing market.
The UK will continue to welcome people who wish to live, work and seek a life here.
However, it is not as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies who want to buy homes as hardworking UK residents.
For many people, their dream of owning a home has been shattered, and sleeping in uncomfortable places is becoming a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My biggest goal is to coach Scotland's national team'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "big goal" is to manage the Scotland national team for a while.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking to do his best to bring back the North East side in good times, who are third in the Championship, with three points to go.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Championship last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was called up to the B team and that was that", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden often with my dad as a child and it was something that always kept me coming back.
The opportunity comes once, when I can coach the team well".
Ross' previous coaching positions at Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he feels less confident after stepping up to coach the great club, having previously turned down coaching spells at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success now will be tested by asking myself, 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
"Given the structure and structure of the club, there is no doubt that they should be in the Premier League".
"It is not an easy task to get there, but I probably only see myself as being able to achieve goals here when I can't bring this team back to the league".
Ross has only been in the coaching ranks for three years, following a long spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell as Hearts coach.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the Third Division and converted St Mirren from relegation to the Second Division, and won the League Cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels better now after his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was possible that the paths would cross in their own way", he recalled as he was coaching Alloa.
"I certainly thought that childhood was more important to me than playing.
It may sound strange, but never mind, I have had a good life and am happy with what I have achieved.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you can go through each week.
I still get it but it's in the stereotype of a female but I feel that coaching is a good thing.
I always wanted to coach and now I'm doing it, I feel like it's a profession I've worked hard on all my adult life".

The hot summer sun has increased the number of Britons heading to the less-favoured bars but has put more pressure on the various restaurants.
Bar groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in arrivals in July; but restaurant attendance fell 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA's economic adviser, who compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and the continued progress of England in the World Cup means that July will follow the trend of June, when bar attendance increased by 2.8 per cent, with restaurants still hit hardest.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in June was worse in July.
Pubs have proven to be more effective than restaurants would ever be.
The dining room was also made of solar, although not as strong as the restaurants themselves.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In bars, sales of alcohol fell by 6.6 percent in one month, while food dropped by three percent".
"These numbers are constantly fluctuating as we have seen since late April", said Paul Newman, of entertainment and hospitality analytics firm RSM.
The trend and other factors affecting mass and sporting activities remain the primary drivers of the consumer-driven consumer revolution.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant owners continue to struggle, and despite a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales, it is likely to be particularly painful adding to the current price pressure.
The hottest summer has not been a bad time for restaurant companies and time will tell if the average temperatures seen in August will give us the break we have been waiting for".
Total bar and restaurant sales, including new openings, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the opening of branded bars and restaurants.
The Coffer Peach Tracker tracks the sales of bars and restaurants, collecting and analyzing performance data from 47 companies with combined revenues of £9 billion and is the industry benchmark.
One in five children have private social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, have private social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, research shows.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in "fake Instagram" pages.
The news reflects the fear of sexual abuse being spread.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "normal" parent-referral account.
One in three children, as young as 11, would set up private accounts on social media sites and hide them from adults.
A survey of nearly 20,000 high school students found a dramatic increase in "fake Instagram" accounts, where they were trying to comment on the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The report reflects the fear of sexual abuse being spread.
Twenty percent of students reported that they were successful without posting harmful content on "normal" parent-directed accounts, while they had some private ones.
One parent stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's private website and found the teenager asking others to "rape" her.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had dual profiles, with half of those admitting to having private accounts.
"It is extremely sad that teenagers would be lured to a website where parents and teachers cannot see them", said HMC CEO Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "spokesperson for the athletes" at the Scottish Athletes' Council
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletes' Council as a non-executive non-executive director of the governing body at the Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is a highly skilled athlete from Scotland and the chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, described the decision as an opportunity for sports authorities to benefit from the expanded international experience over the past decades.
Beattie said: "Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and international sports community and we are convinced that the Scottish players can greatly benefit from having him on board".
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be the voice of the athletes and believe I can truly contribute and help to the stewardship of sport in Scotland".
American 200 and 400 metres medallist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, one of four Olympic gold medalists who is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was left paralyzed after suffering a transient traumatic brain injury (TIA).
"I have been suffering from a stroke for a month", he wrote on Twitter.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that the time would determine whether I would recover or become disabled.
It was a difficult surgery, but I recovered, learned to walk again, and now I am doing some leg exercises!
Thank you for sending me encouraging messages!"

The slogan is: "Let it go, let it go, I'm feeding the baby, let it go, let it go, I'm sucking my women".
However, the advertisement, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused a stir online.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, the video received mixed reviews, with many saying it exposed the "bad" in the dairy industry.
"It is a bad decision to use cows in advertising this product.
One said: "Like us, they need us to conceive to give birth and give milk, unless their young are stolen on the day they are born".
Elvie's breast pump is so tightly fitted that it is invisible under the breastplate of the nursing mother (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented: "It is understandably a source of stress for parents and their babies.
But then why not use the same advert to advertise baby wipes for parents who decide to keep their babies?"
Another added: "That is a far-reaching publicity stunt".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny".
"I think this is a good idea.
I even picked one up when I was breastfeeding.
The pumps made me feel good and healthy.
The advert is a little crazy but I took it as it is.
"This is a work of wisdom", one writer wrote.
Another commented: "The ad is aimed at parents who are breastfeeding (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the female group is shown dancing with invisible pumps embedded in their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a pump say they feel like a cow.
However, the pump made by Elvie's factory does not emit any pollutants, no wires or debris and fits smoothly into the breastplate of the nursing woman, giving the woman the freedom to move around, carry their babies and even go outside to breastfeed.
Ana Balarin, partner and head of early childhood development at Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that needs to be marketed in a unique way.
By comparing women who would do what they want to a weaning cow, we wanted to show breastfeeding and its limitations, while also showing the warmth and the natural way the pump will produce.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has been the subject of media attention.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared to be showing off a collection of clothing designed by fashion designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were quietly taken to camps on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children incarcerated has increased dramatically despite the monthly border crossings being relatively stable, in part due to the strict policies and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it harder to provide foster care for children.
Typically, many of the insured were also undocumented immigrants who feared they would risk their ability to remain in the country if they came to claim a child.
The risks were compounded in June when government agencies announced that prospective adopters and other adults in their households must provide fingerprints and that information must be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to marry underage children without an adult.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 percent of people who want to be insured or have family insurance are in the country illegally and most of them are immigrants who have committed crimes.
"We are now continuing to track these people", Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, authorities introduced new rules requiring some children to be brought to court within a month of their arrest, instead of the 60 days that had been agreed upon by immigration officials.
Many are seen via video calls, rather than live appearances, to ask an immigration judge to verify their legal status.
Those deemed ineligible for facilitated deportation will be immediately returned to their country of origin.
The longer children spend in the cell, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, leading to anger mixed with conflict and attempted escape, according to immigration officials and systematic reports over the past few months.
Advocates say such concerns are expressed in a large facility like Tornillo, where there are signs of child abuse that are often overlooked because of the size of the child.
They add that moving children to tents without giving them enough time to emotionally bond and say goodbye to friends can lead to the depression that many would struggle with.
Syria tells US, France and Turkey to respond immediately to 'occupation forces'
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home despite the eight-year civil war in the country.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be dealt with appropriately.
"The troops must withdraw immediately and without further delay", he tells the assembly.
Moualem stressed that the "war on terror is coming to an end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and more than a million have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until all parts of Syria are cleared of" terrorist groups "and foreigners in the forbidden land".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to provide training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces of the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn part of the country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were sufficient for their return and criticized "some Western countries" for "creating panic" and keeping refugees abroad.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return", he said.
"They would change politics from a matter of just helping people".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there may be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a no-fly zone in the face of the military crackdown in Idlib has created a window of opportunity to push for political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement thwarted a planned Russian offensive supporting Syrian forces in a region of 3 million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement clearly set "deadlines" and expressed the hope that military operations against jihadist forces, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, would also be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new government-opposition committee to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the way for elections will soon take place.
Moualem directed the Syrian government to attend the committee, saying the work of the committee should focus on "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution", and warned of possible disruption.
How will Trump win a second term?
According to the rationale, Mr. Trump would have won the 2020 election, except for the liberal observers who may believe, that the president is being ostracized and that there are serious problems with his term ending prematurely.
"He's like the last great presidential game ever!"
So far, there is no evidence that the viewers have ever been tired.
Since 2014, the rating has more than doubled to 1.05 on CNN and 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average primary audience of 2.4 million, up 1.7 from four years ago, according to Nielsen data, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" leads the television with 3.5 million viewers for the night's top news stories.
"This is the hell people would go to because they don't understand anything", said Neal Baer, the host of the ABC series "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different view.
She recalls being driven to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"She says, 'Because she makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There is a lot of fun to be had in a mess.
Of course, while nothing else is as good as TV, the story behind the Washington state could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, immigrant families reunification and the global economy.
Clearly, the only positive outlook that TV viewers can have is positive.
And it claims to be the only public informed when you find yourself watching six hours of television where various experts debate the use of "unidentified interrogation techniques" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear", a $15,000 suit made from Paul Manafort's autograph ("a lot of the same stuff", according to The Washington Post) and the appalling description by Stormy Daniels of Mr. Trump's body.
I, for one, would not look at Super Mario in any other way.
"One of the things he's doing that sounds like a live show where he gives you a new show every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", referring to Trump's show changing cast and changing story every day (where he attacks the NFL show, praising Kim Jong-un).
You should not look away from one side or be left behind.
I tried to reach Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees Celsius outside his home on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was in the house watching MSNBC when he was going to pick up CNN.
He could not get out of it, even with Brett Kavanaugh facing the Senate Arbitration Committee and the future of the Supreme Court uncertain.
"I remember when we were having some crazy talks the other day and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true".

Foreign funds are being heavily used in midterm elections where opponents are competing for very few votes.
It is not surprising that the upcoming 17th Pennsylvania general election is a very expensive one, as the change in congressional districts has seen two congressmen running for the same seat.
It recently re-branded the Pittsburgh line to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election this winter.
Lamb faces his running mate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is closely tied to the new 17th district.
The maps were added after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally redrawn to give the Republicans a chance.
The 17th District's struggle has made campaign finance a contentious issue between the major parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow margin of victory in a special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by a Republican for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts suggest that the Democrats may win by a narrow margin.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, then retaliating.
Diplomats learned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing's government, calling it Washington State.
Mr. Trump had a successful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 where he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners were fired by the Trump Organization's regulatory team.
State Department officials decided to request that U.S. officials withdraw from diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama following "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only intended for El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in subsidies and a certain level of social security, would seriously affect the Central American country and would increase unemployment and crime rates.
As the summit progressed, the leaders of Central and North America postponed a summit focused on security and economic development to follow up on a similar summit last year that was seen as a step toward curbing immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made clear they wanted the meeting to continue, immediately dropping any plans to impose sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to address the summit, now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the strength of leadership at the summit, according to Democrats.
And three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic where no new serious messages or sanctions were issued by Washington.
US presidential spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on whether the conversation was interpreted by three US officials, including two diplomats, who held private talks on condition of anonymity.
The claims were confirmed by an independent analyst who works closely with the government and who also asked not to be named.
Learning about history
The next person to be fired is likely to be special counsel Robert Mueller, due to his reporting to Mr. Trump that he may be a threat to the integrity of the country, which has been strongly documented in the media.
Mr. Mueller said he was reversing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign had any Russian ties to the attack on our election.
If Congress changes its position, Mr. Trump could find himself held accountable by the agency, as he prepares to return to the voters and possibly his own board of friends.
This is a very serious plan, and I'm not saying I don't suggest that Mr. Trump's farm should be ignored, or that he should be treated differently in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine how long we can face each other.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had stood up and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We have been exhausted and have no chance to prevent years of massacres that have taken place.
The course of history is heavily dependent on these major achievements and the democratic process can be delayed or delayed.
The Americans are in the midst of these major operations right now.
What can we do when Mr. Trump fires Deputy State Representative Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the future of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the doldrums since the newspaper reported last year that he had called for a secret presidential vote and spread rumors that he was unfit to run for president.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the story reported by The Times is not accurate.
"How do we respond to the recent request for a new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh when it was not conducted in a complete or objective manner; or when it was confirmed that he was presiding over the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual misconduct and fraudulent testimony?
Besides, will we vote in the midterm elections to elect a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to do this, democracy will be a mess.
But I hope that we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Czechoslovak Jew, was sent to Auschwitz when the Nazi regime seized the embassy where I lived.
He survived, he immigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me a Christmas candle on the table with the Nazi logo.

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Australians, after a draw with Spanish side Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a good position to exit Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans' knee injury after his first appearance in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but believes Rangers can build on the results as the start of big things.
"It was a good score because Villarreal was a good team", the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game hoping we could make a difference, but we lost.
We may have won the game that was coming to an end, but overall, a draw seems like a good way to end the game.
Probably the best players in the first half we also play them in the second half and they played better overall.
On Thursday, there is another major European tournament.
I believe we can get three points but it will be a big game because they won the last game, but with the fans, I believe we can play well and take the win.
Last year was a great year, in between everything that happened I got injured and changed my team but there is something good in my team now.
It's a good team and my teammates are happy with it, training is going well.
I believe we can look for a way to win now, forget about last year's Games and get to the goal".
Women would be sleep deprived because of the fear of retirement savings.
Although some survey respondents clearly understood how they wanted to be cared for, few would talk to their families about it.
Nearly half of respondents in a Nationwide survey said they would talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want family support, but they don't talk about the steps to get it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance at Nationwide.
Here is where they should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as these options may be a factor in determining the cost.
Get a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Options for long-term care include standard long-term care insurance, a health insurance plan that provides cash to cover the costs or self-funding with your own money as long as you have the money.
Seek an answer according to the books of thy law: beware of perpetual disputes.
Look for alternative medical care to appoint a representative to oversee the treatment you receive and to ensure that doctors respect your wishes if you are unable to express your opinion.
And you should also consider the impact of your money.
You can choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to work to ensure that your bills are paid when you are unable to.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about her medications and physical symptoms?
Write down these details to prepare.
"It's not just about money", Martin asks, "but who are the doctors?"
"What treatments are available?

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, with the death toll expected to rise.
While the reception and transmission systems were not functioning, officials in the rescue operation were unable to receive any signals from Donggala, located north of Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were rescued after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palu is a city in Central Sulawesi, located near the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city will remember the 40 years since it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a coastal region of over 300 km (180 mi) in length in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The area, an administrative sub-district, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and livestock are the main economic activities in Central Sulawesi, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most mining is concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western province of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located above the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 and triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, half of them Acehans.
2005: A series of major earthquakes occurred off the coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that washes up on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck a region near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami that sends 10-meter-high (about 33 feet) waves through the waters, destroying several villages, and killing 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake in Aceh's Pidie Jaya province causes extensive damage and new fears as it reminds the population that the 2004 tsunami did not cause significant damage and death.
No tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people died in the flooding.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the allegations, she was stripped of her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and has posted an unsecured bail of US$500, according to KTUU.
He was arraigned in court on Saturday, where he said he "does not believe the allegations" when asked whether he believes the allegations, according to the TV station.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanor counts, which carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, she was charged with abusing her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, calls the police to report the assault.
He is currently being tried in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice and possession of a controlled substance in connection with a domestic violence incident.
His girlfriend wanted him to punch her in the face.
Sarah Palin was ostracized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to the trauma of serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The fire has severely damaged communications networks and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck in Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on international media show the moment the quake occurred.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami washed up on the coast.
Federal prosecutors would seek the rare death penalty for a terrorist attack in NYC.
Prosecutors in New York were seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a New York City suicide bombing that killed eight people; a rare death sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a crime against the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot rental truck to attack pedestrians on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists on the road in October.
To enforce the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious injury, according to the death penalty application, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these offenses could lead to the death penalty, according to court records.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of aiding and abetting the deaths of eight people, which were used by federal prosecutors in the intentional homicide trial and the indictment of cruelty and vehicular manslaughter.
The attack required "extensive planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's use of "a supernatural, brutal and vicious attack".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov injured, maimed and killed the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said, describing his plan.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the District Court of New York last ruled on the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were exonerated after being convicted of spying for the former Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has expressed no regrets about his actions in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt better about what he had done, according to police.
Saipov told authorities that he had the idea to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS terrorists on his mobile phone, according to a document containing the charges against him.
He also demanded that the ISIS banner be displayed in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defendants representing Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision is to seek the death penalty rather than plead guilty to the charges and to seek life in prison without the possibility of parole, which would be further embarrassing for all parties involved", Patton said.
The defense team for Saipov had asked prosecutors not to impose the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be given the job of negotiating Britain's exit from the EU
Nigel Farage vowed to 'make people feel welcome' today at a rally in the lead up to the Tory Party conference.
The former Ukip leader says politicians should come out of the "shadow" of criticism of the EU, with one of Theresa May's own MPs saying she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative non-voting MP Peter Bone told a crowd in Birmingham that Britain would be "out of the loop" now that Mr Farage is Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.
But the challenge for Mrs May is to unite her dissident colleagues to get Tories who want to stay in the EU to take part in another protest against Britain leaving the EU in the cities.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Brexit plan on track amid a wave of attacks from Brexit and EU-staying parties.
The allies insisted that he would continue to try to negotiate with Belgium despite some negative reactions, and pressed him to criticize the EU and the Labour Party for choosing his own agenda and problems.
Mr Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "abolish the UK's plan to leave the EU".
He said that Mr. Farage should be included and given the responsibility of negotiating with Belgium.
'If he had been the ruler, we would have been out of here already.'
The Wellingborough MP went on to say: "I will support Britain leaving the EU but we need to get rid of the UK's plan to leave the EU".
Speaking about his position on the EU, he said: 'We have never fought world wars to show our weakness.
We want to make laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone rejected the popular vote since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.'
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkyns, who was also on the tour, told reporters: 'All I want to say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The UK's plan to leave the EU is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our revolutionaries who are taking to the streets are the ones who are getting us elected in the first place.
Put that plan aside and start listening.'
In a similar message to Mrs May, he said: 'The Prime Ministers keep their job when they deliver on their promises.'
Mr Farage told politicians on tour that they need to feel 'shadow' if we are to betray the 2016 election results.
'What is left now is trust between us, the people and the political establishment,' he said.
'They would try to thwart the UK's plan to leave the EU and we are here today to tell them that 'we will never tolerate you being blamed.'
In a message to a cheering crowd, he said: 'I want to put our political system, which is about to undermine the UK's plan to leave the EU, in the shade.
"We are calling on the people to protect this country that has given us victory in taking the UK out of the EU and we will never rest until we do it, led, and proud by Britain".
Meanwhile, supporters of keeping Britain in the family made their way to Birmingham before stopping for two hours in the city centre.
Reformers waved Tory flags to protest Britain's exit from the European Union after launching the group over the weekend.
Labour members including Lord Adonis criticized conservatives for security concerns they faced on the party platform as the meeting began.
He added: 'These are the people who tell us that we have technology and that all of Canada's technology is advanced, customs-free borders, free trade at the Irish border.'
'That's not true at all.
There is nothing better than getting Britain out,' he added.
Warren plans to "think hard" about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Monday that she would "consider seriously running for president" after the November election.
The Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, The Boston Globe reports.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's vice-chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He has been mentioned as a potential challenger to Trump in 2020.
The event, which took place on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, was his 36th meeting with voters in his constituency using the double-house system since Trump took office.
A speaker at the meeting asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded, "It's time for women to go to Washington and support our divided government with a woman as its leader".
A man has been arrested in a fatal shooting at LSU's Sims.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, La., police announced that a suspect was arrested in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot and killed by police.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said it had arrested Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. eastern time, according to a news release.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking people to help identify the person in the photos.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims died of a gunshot wound to the head and died at the scene", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was rescuing his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the shooting with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-2 junior at Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton was close to winning the World Championship after the team declared him the winner after defeating Sebastian Vettel
It is clear from Valtteri Bottas' racing points ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes has confirmed that he will be a major player in the car race.
From the start of the race, Bottas started well and came close to beating Hamilton when he fought for the lead in the first two laps and gave Vettel a shot at his teammate.
Vettel went to the tyre change first and left Hamilton behind in a decisive overthrow.
Mercedes' cars were well behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a collision with a Ferrari car and a poor steering left a gap and forced him to fight for his place in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started behind the other cars and finished seventh after the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He led most of the race on his wheels to finish fourth behind Kimi Raikkonen.
He also made it to the 44th lap of the race but was unable to increase his speed for the final eight laps as Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a good job all weekend and he's become a good person.
Hamilton said: "The team did a fantastic job to get first and second place".
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump criticized Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who was running on Saturday, for insisting that she was not the one who published a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking on the campaign trail in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but suggested that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad, cruel and untrustworthy".
"One thing that can happen and is good is that in the last few days in the Senate, you see anger, you see angry and evil people and cruel and untrustworthy people".
"When you see something that's been published without permission, you can say, 'Oh, I never did that.
I did not".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you ever published this without permission?
Remember his response . . . you once took the tract out without permission; "uh, uh, what?
Uh, no.
I never did".
It's fine, except for a little.
We have published without permission...No, we have not published without permission", he said, to please the computer.
Feinstein received a letter explaining the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was released without prior authorization in early September, but Feinstein denied the release without prior authorization from his office.
"I have never covered up Dr. Ford's allegations, nor have I made public or authorized his story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I did as he asked".
But his denial was apparently not well received by the president, who said during Saturday night's campaign rally: "I can tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe not, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats would use the allegations to their advantage.
"They are determined to rebuild themselves in any way possible.
They see evil, cruelty, they don't care who they can hurt, who they can manipulate to gain power and control". quoted by Mediaite as saying by the president
Elite League: Dundee Stars defeated Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars turned a blind eye to Friday's Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants, who won the tie-breaker 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two early goals on runs by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the team in receiving before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the equaliser against Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe, who won the replay by beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time in a season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning their first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the 35th minute from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford passing Beauvillier to score a second goal a few minutes later.
In what appeared to be a strong start to the game, Sullivan returned the team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt passed the ball to Cownie and scored the go-ahead touchdown at 15:16.
Dwyer kept the Giants in the lead for the first half when he scored the second touchdown of the night in the bottom of the first.
The hosts scored again and Bouchard scored another equaliser at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-half lead in the game and he managed to win the game in the final minutes.
The Giants, now four games down from their last five, will visit Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A flight attendant died to help hundreds of people on board survive the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller would be considered a hero after he died trying to land a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely.
More than 800 people were killed and dozens were reported missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The latest major earthquakes continued to hit the area and many people were buried in the rubble of buildings in Palu.
But despite the lives of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in a tower that would have been unusually shaken by a controlled airstorm at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He continued his work to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which had caught fire, could fly safely.
Then he jumps out of the control tower when he thinks it's going to crash.
He died in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died in the crash before the helicopter reached Palu.
He added: "We are very sorry to hear that".
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the Disaster Management Centre says the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are not well-attended.
The number is still rising as more bodies are buried and remains are left behind while many others are still unaccounted for", said agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A six-meter high wave damaged Palu, where a mass grave is scheduled for Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulance arrives with bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops were looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find.
"It's already dangerous, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete every rescue operation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed over 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Now, Air Niugini says one person is missing after it crashed into a kibaz
The airline that operated the plane that crashed on the Pacific coast of Micronesia is now reporting a man missing after it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew on board the plane had been safely evacuated from the crash site.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it was unable to identify the male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide additional information about the passenger such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane plunged into the water while attempting to land on Chuuk Island.
Seven people were taken to hospital on Friday, officials said.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all were in good health.
The cause of the accident is not clear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane crashed into a valley just after the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane missed the road.
American friend Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"That is a wonderful thing", says Jayness.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through the water that reached the waist and to get out of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight crew was terrified and screamed and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors nearby had created a rescue harbor that enabled them to use a rescue boat to get people to shore before the plane crashed nearly 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people may have died in airline crashes on airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades but none on Air New Guinea.
An analyst has revealed the night time of a woman who was burned alive.
Prosecutors filed a complaint Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
On Wednesday, US Department of Justice official Paul Rowlett gave hours of testimony as an expert witness in the analysis of crime scene intelligence.
He also showed the jury how he used his mobile phone to access the travel records of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett claimed to have received location information from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contrary to previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When reports surfaced that her mobile phone was ringing in the presence of Chambers while she claimed to be with her boyfriend Michael Sanford, police contacted Sanford.
Sanford went to the witnessing session on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis would be truthful in saying he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because his car was in Nashville".
Another conflicting story is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks after his death.
Cell phone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's text messages, phone calls and her father's address from her phone.
"She left him out of her life", Hale said.
The accused is expected to deliver his verdict on Sunday.
The judge said the verdict was expected to be heard by the jury in the late afternoon of the same day.
The High Breed: Did they know they were doing hip hop?
A trio of hip hop artists aim to combat stereotypes of the genre by incorporating a positive message into their songs.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its original message and away from addressing social issues.
They wanted to get back on the market and make hip hop that was smart and popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have been revived in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York foster mother sues boyfriend for firing her after posting "irondaruhu"
A New York foster parent is accusing her boyfriend of discrimination after she fired him for receiving a misleading email from another parent complaining that he was "another black person".
The couple denies the allegations, calling the charge "robbery".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was devastated to learn that the caregiver for her newborn, Giselle Maurice, was black after she arrived at work on her first day in 2016.
"NOAAAAAAA and NO ONE in the EU", Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Madamazela Maurice.
After learning of her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "felt uneasy" about dismissing Ms. Maurice, saying that the absent nanny, an African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting to find a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in an Uber taxi.
Now, Maurice is suing his girlfriends for damages for firing him and is seeking damages of US$350 a day for six months, despite being offered a job he was supposed to do without a contract.
"I wanted to show you that this is not how it works", he told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's racist".
Her partners responded to accusations of racial discrimination, saying that firing Maurice was the right thing to do, fearing she would not be able to trust him after her unkind remarks.
"My wife sent me something that I shouldn't have said.
He doesn't make a fuss.
We are not racist", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone who spoke badly to you, even though it was wrong?
When your baby is born?
It is impossible".
Linking the allegation to "robbery", Plasco said his wife was two months pregnant and was "in very serious trouble".
"Would you try to follow someone like that?
It's not always the right thing to do", said an investment professional.
As the trial proceeded, a jury of people quickly dismissed the online dating partners based on their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington publishers fear readers will not be able to relate to the novel, a new letter shows.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, wrote in a letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time since it was published.
It is fascinating to learn that what we now know about Paddington is due to his many accomplishments".
He said his father, who worked for the BBC as a cameraman before coming up with the idea of writing children's books including a little puppet, would be a shame if his career was dismissed, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books was "a mixture of joy and sorrow" following his death last year.
Of Paddington, describing him as "a very important member of our family", added that his father was extremely proud of his achievements.
"He was a very quiet man and was not a proud man".
"But because Paddington was honest, it was like when you have a child and you achieve something: you're proud of yourself even though you didn't actually do it.
I think he saw Paddington's achievement in that way.
Although he had created and conceived it, he always credited Paddington himself for the gift".
My daughter was dying and I had to make a phone call.
Upon discharge, her daughter was rushed to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
Ms. Ednan-Laperouseati: "Nad kept calling to say that things were bad and that it was not expected that he would recover".
"Then Nad called me to tell me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And that is what I did.
I said: "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
I will be with you.
Doctors prescribed medication to keep his heart rate low until he was out of the body.
He died prematurely and his entire body was inoperable.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was going to happen.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was stuck in trouble surrounded by families and people.
I had to be patient".
Then, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, who had boarded the plane with other passengers, forgot the problems she would have to go through.
"No one knows where he came from, " he replied.
"I shook my head and cried incessantly.
It is hard to explain, but it was because of that flight that I felt deeply involved in Nad's grief.
She needed my love and attention.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women displayed signs to protest the bridge collapse.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide would work to prevent others from having their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted maps on the Welsh Bridge with messages to change your mind and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler, who was 13 when he began suffering from depression, committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, of Lydney, described her son as a hopeful cook with a smile that appealed to many.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up the room".
However, he left his work before his death, for he was "in darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, learned that his older brother had taken his own life.
"I'm still worried that it could affect her", Ms. Davis said.
Mrs. Davis left me cards, "to let people know that there are people they can reach out to and talk to, even if they are friends.
Don't just sit there, you need someone to talk to".
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davies, lost her boyfriend of 15 years, Mark, a few days after her mother died.
"He never felt depressed or overwhelmed", she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her attitude.
He was very upset at Christmas; he didn't look at the children or do anything else when they opened their presents".
She said that her death had caused them great pain, but they needed to find a way out: "There is a big hole in the family.
You are being bullied.
But we all have to keep going and keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future remains uncertain as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I think, if we can get something like what we've requested, an investigation with some time on it, with some limits; it could bring us closer together", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "splitting up" if there were disagreements among its members.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to stop investigating?
Their delay is due to the time it was made.
With the midterm elections only five weeks away, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans fail to deliver, they will have been very unsuccessful in their attempt to get their favorite person nominated for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush received calls from senators asking him to endorse Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who introduced him to his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's special assistant.
What will happen after the FBI starts its report?
There will be elections in the 51-member Senate, which is made up of Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh would be able to secure at least 50 Senate votes, leaving Vice President Mike Pence with the final vote of approval as Chief Justice.
The number of North Korean refugees has "decreased" under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, who cited data from the Korean Union Ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and high fees for known smugglers of refugees are a problem.
Pyongyang has not made any official statements.
Many of the North Korean refugees are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone known as the DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, still at war, have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the delayed talks on denuclearization.
It comes after a historic June summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work extensively to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions for not taking any action since then.
"There is no hope for the United States to build trust in our national security and if so, there is no way we can as one country stop developing nuclear weapons first", Mr. Ri said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "a slave to emotions", saying he was not fit to be a Supreme Court official.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh an "emotional slave" and said he was morally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but wonder if a woman has ever acted in this way, claiming to be 'depressed,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times screaming and grumbling when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also publicly criticized the Democrats on the committee, saying the "unusual and defamatory" charges against him were made by pundits angry about Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony would have ended his tenure as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, as it would have exposed him as an attack on Democrats.
"I think he was removed from office because of his comments and his attacks on the Clintons and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh once confirmed and whether Democrats would gain a majority in the House.
"I'm just saying that if she's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then she shouldn't be working for the Supreme Court, but she should be working for the court she's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would be able to pass a case challenging the Affordable Care Act in Roe v. Wade, which is seen as conservative justice.
In the case of his conviction, Kavanaugh sidestepped the question of whether he could overturn some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time to be a slave to emotions, someone who has a stake in the court and expects us to say, 'This is not good.'"
And women should use it as a weapon.
It is the assault of people with words, months and years of anger and why they cannot speak without crying.
"We cry when we have a fever", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman in management somewhere, who said she also cried when she was angry, but she needed a technique that worked so that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to", You may think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I am angry with you".
He keeps going.
I think that's a good idea".
Tears are a natural outlet for anger because they are often misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of my first job, in an all-male office, was crying in an indescribable rage, being grabbed by a grown-up-looking man, a manager who I would describe as a bit of a bully, and walking into the bar.
"Don't let them see you cry", he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're unhappy and are happy because they listen to you".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having sex with a stranger on the Monkey Business and immediately withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was furious, realized that there was no reason she should not give up the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said with a laugh after 30 years.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and one that they hadn't wanted at all was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".
As she was running late, she was behind on fundraising and decided she would never run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a struggle he could not win.
He learned that some of his supporters had donated $1,000 to men who could only give him $250.
"Do they think I'm being undervalued?" she asked.
As he delivered his speech announcing that he would not run for public office, he became overwhelmed with emotion, gratitude for his supporters, anger at the administrative system that made it harder for him to raise funds and reach voters than it was to reach representatives and anger about class discrimination, and became angry.
"You thought I might be overwhelmed by stress", Ms. Schroeder recalled of the advert she received.
"You probably thought Kleenex was a support company.
I remember thinking about what would be written on my tombstone.
"Did she cry"?""
How can U.S.-China trade be a good thing for Beijing?
The two-front trade war between the US and China had blinded the public and if the next war is not soon over, the tensions between the two countries could be in Beijing's long-term interest, experts say.
US President Donald Trump was the first to introduce tariffs earlier this year on Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most visible of these agreements was this week's imposition of new tariffs that affect US$200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, including goods imported from China, resulting in tariffs on almost half of all US imports.
Beijing has responded in a similar fashion, recently imposing tariffs of between five and 10 percent on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China is committed to aligning with the US, and is the world's second largest economy and is unlikely to be derailed at all.
Getting Washington to reconsider means making demands, but publicly bowing to the US may be a major embarrassment to Xi Jinping, the President of China.
And experts still say that if Beijing responds appropriately, the shadow of a trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing its relationship with the two largest economies.
"A hasty political decision by either Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a change of direction for both countries that would be as bad for the war observers as they previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, an associate Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security, which is part of the group.
Syria 'ready' to take in newly arrived refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is open to the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the EU General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's economic situation was improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is peaceful and secure due to the steps taken in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to rebuild areas devastated by the suicide bombings in an effort to restore normalcy.
All guidelines are in place for refugees who wish to voluntarily return to their country of origin because of the threat of terrorism and economic policies that are not in line with their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome anyone to help rebuild the war-torn country.
But he stressed that he may not accept help from countries that have encouraged independence.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team in the final by 16.5 points to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
To date, the United States has lost six straight Ryder Cups on European soil and has not won a European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the Danish team under captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who was very disappointed with the competition, threw his water polo ball on the 3rd hole of 16, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all rounds, becoming the 1st of 4 players to score more than 5-0-0 since the current tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the European team's low scorer Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson won 2 games to 1 against Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup match.
A veteran of the Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the most successful player in European competition with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop crying.
It was a big year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and put his trust in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to have my cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have been able to help", Garcia said with a big smile after winning the European Championship.
He succeeded fellow American golfer John Ram, who beat American golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in a one-man match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost his last four games in France and is currently 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup play.
The most impressive statistic is that one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team struggled all weekend to find a good match against Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at the highest level in all competitions.
Team USA captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of the players, they fought as hard as they could.
This morning, we put some pressure on the European team.
We were divided.
We are very grateful to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We'll get back together as a team, I'll do my best to get to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Competition Committee and we'll go far.
I love these 12 players and am proud to be their captain.
You should consult your captain.
We played more".
Red noise update: prevalence is declining in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
New reports from the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife Health indicate a general decline in red-cockaded woodpeckers prevalent in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the actual players would be concentrated in parts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties; meaning there was a decrease in focus on the game.
The Red Tide's strong performance added nearly 210 miles of sandy coastline from the northern tip of Pinellas County to the southern tip of Lee County.
Spots can be found within about 25 km of the coastline of Hillsborough County, but few sites are as recent as last week.
Red noise was also detected in Pasco County.
Moderate depression in or along the Pinellas County coast was reported last week, low and high depression in or along the Hillsborough County coast, strong depression in Manatee County, where it is most pronounced in and along the Sarasota County coast, low depression in Charlotte County, and low depression in Lee County and high depression in Collier County.
Respiratory problems continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory problems were reported in northwest Florida during the past week.
