The report also highlights the need for a European road safety strategy.
They are less than 100 metres apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian light was put into operation in Gutach, in the village parking lot - within sight of the old town hall light.
Two plants so close together, intent or a trick?
The question was clearly answered by the mayor of Gutach yesterday.
"The town hall was installed because it secures the school road", Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights are designed to protect cyclists, bus passengers and Bergle residents.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, was important for the junction of Sulzbachweg and Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, a spa, a bus stop, a doctor and a bank, and the traffic flow from the Grub residential area.
"In the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light was needed to ensure safety", says Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg county council office.
"According to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B33 every day, of which about 10% are heavy goods vehicles", Arnold emphasises.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the implementation of the new rules.
In total, four traffic controls were carried out, and a roundabout was also planned, but was rejected because of the tightness at the junction of Sulzbachweg and Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before the choice of the location of the traffic lights: "By means of a special van loaded with particularly long wooden trunks, we tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without bending the traffic lights".
The lighting system itself, which costs around €15,000, is "the most modern thing on the market today", Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights can be clearly seen by drivers even in low-light conditions.
It is also economical: The older lighting systems use about 100 watts, while the new ones use just eight watts.
There are three lighting fixtures per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the traffic light, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, the pedestrian will see green immediately, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or a handicapped person crosses the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone can cross the road safely", Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver must be a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the pedestrian light turned green, a high-class vehicle passed by - in bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing down the hardships of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the penchant for raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose writer, and theatre texts are rare in his work.
Gerhard Fresacher is putting together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weatherlights on the Tip of the Tongue", which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz.
The theatermaker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "The Servant" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa on which, in allusion, copulation and masturbation take place - the eight-piece ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the script.
The 70-minute performance overshadows the presentation with a wealth of directorial casts familiar from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
The actresses in particular are often involved in the sometimes questionable stage adaptations.
They're being held tight, their heads are submerged, their evening gowns are taped to the wall.
Trapped in cellophane or wood, they hit dangerously high sticks throughout the performance, either monologue loudly or lie completely dumb on the stage floor.
The text is hardly conveyed in this effortless way.
The best moments are those of the evening when singing is done - from Deep Purple to folk music.
It is only towards the end that the over-the-top performance comes to a halt, and Winkler's absurd humor flashes forth.
A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of funding to fix the decaying highway system, and they believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits on the dashboard of every car.
The devices, which record every mile driven and report the information to authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning agencies to overhaul the outdated system for funding U.S. roads.
The normally rather boring field of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertarians have teamed up with environmental groups to advocate that the government use the small boxes to record the miles driven  and possibly where they were driven  and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states can't wait any longer.
They are currently considering how they can move over the next 10 years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
It's a must for our country.
"It's not something we're just going to use", said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which plans to record the miles driven by all California drivers in the state by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes is going to change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes Americans pay at the pump, is bankrupt.
But America doesn't fill up as much as it used to.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents a gallon (less than 4 euro cents a liter) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians don't dare raise taxes by even a cent when gasoline prices are high.
The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with a recorder to test a mileage-based payment system.
This is the most sensible alternative in the long term, he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mileage-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea is popular with urban liberals, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour to reduce congestion and climate-damaging emissions.
California planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to meet the state's ambitious, legally-enforced climate change goals.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers at the Reason Foundation are also keen on the idea of charging drivers for the distance they cover.
This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole, explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward mileage-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to concerns from rural MPs who represent people who often travel many miles to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the mileage tax to the state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it on a limited scale on trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transportation departments from 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently studying how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical that the government could track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem", explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test began, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into mature surveillance devices".
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that can help the state track miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
Khan said that would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company was not originally formed to help states with driver taxation.
Rather, it was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are expected to pay based on miles driven.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded", explained Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made serious mistakes.
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose not to use any equipment at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept to a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxing device that will allow parking fees to be paid, insurance to be paid only for miles driven, and real-time speed data from other vehicles to help drivers avoid traffic jams.
Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder if all the talk about paying per mile is just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little fuel, so that they too pay a fair share.
There is no need for surgery if aspirin is enough, explains Randy Rentschler, Commissioner for Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a host of other things.
The small team is fighting hard
The Volunteer Fire Department has successfully completed its fall drill despite a staff shortage.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Division commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate of the Feather in Burgberger Straße in his training.
They say there was a short circuit when they were sawing.
Two people were injured by the fire and smoke, but one of them was able to call for help.
Two air-raid guards from the Wehrmacht prepared to enter the building after Hans Kammerer had first checked the situation.
After a short time, the first person was found and released.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not easy, since there was also a narrow staircase to climb.
The building, a workshop with an integrated two-horse stable, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and also bales of straw in it.
Electric machines were also used to work wood.
The first attack was made from the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was through an overpass hydrant about 100 meters away.
Three deleting attacks were now possible.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
The aim of the exercise was also to show what could be done with the limited staff available.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld Day Response Team.
The commander was satisfied with the outcome of the exercise.
The importance of networking between universities and enterprises
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald county, the President of the Landtag Guido Wolf also informed himself in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Hochschwarzwald Support Centre, he worked with the heads of vocational schools and the district high school and the chairmen of the parents' councils on this important issue.
"Education is an important factor in location", underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma school, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the regional support centre, the regional high school and the vocational training centre in the forest city.
He also commended the family-friendliness of the district.
"It is important to keep an eye not only on the family phase but also on the care of dependants phase due to demographic change", explained Wolf.
It also stated that more and more workers were taking care of and caring for their loved ones.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on workers can lead to termination of employment", said Wolf.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another factor of particular importance was the networking of universities and enterprises.
"For those who have already learned about the region's advantages during their studies, their acquired knowledge and skills often remain with the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region", the president of the Landtag was convinced.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The Commission considers that the Land has a significant advantage in terms of location, given its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also witnessed the efforts already made to expand public transport on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Keep up the perseverance and make sure that public transport is better", he said in his address to the local politicians present.
Music and a Fun Afternoon
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the elderly people of Dietingen for coffee, cake and afterwards a Vespers.
In the past, the elderly were accommodated in the resting place.
Meanwhile, this afternoon is being held at St. Joseph's Home.
The inhabitants of the village were looking forward to the delicious cakes and pies.
Then we had sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich used popular tunes to entertain.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall, which is the front boundary of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, which is being renovated, will once again be included in the city of Bräunlingen's renovation cost plan.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first renovation work on the front schoolyard, a small angular wall was installed to stabilize and statically relieve the more than one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The next step, says Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbaumaamt, is to involve the Landmonumentamt in the planning and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall.
The project will be implemented by the local authorities and the local authorities.
A decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and planting of trees in the old schoolyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be renovated from the ground up and put on a new base in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstrasse is in need of renovation, mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, and has an arch slope forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones indicate weathering damage, but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse.
A strong wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by pupils, which has been done by the current fortification works.
The schoolyard was originally planned to be renovated in 2008/09, but unplanned expenses delayed the project.
An important word in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, the National Monuments Office will participate.
If the city of Bräunlingen receives specifications from this side, it hopes to receive grants from the preservationists.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now again being taught in a well-rehabilitated old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to get jazz training in Stuttgart
The ongoing discussions on the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg have now been joined by Cem Özdemir, the federal chairman of the Greens.
"I think it is wrong to abandon the holistic education at the Stuttgart Music College", Özdemir told the Stuttgart Nachrichten.
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
This is a contradiction to the Green-Red government, which is considered the favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the September 22 Bundestag election.
The Commission is proposing a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg on the basis of an expert study.
The aim is to transfer the study programme Jazz and Pop from the Stuttgart University of Music to the University of Music in Mannheim.
US border: "Super tunnel" for drug smuggling discovered
On the U.S.-Mexico border, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
U.S. Customs officials said the more than 1,500-foot-long pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had not yet been put into use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can get under the radar", said U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California Laura Duffy at a news conference outside a warehouse in San Diego where one end of the tunnel was discovered.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy assured them: "If you continue to build and exploit these tunnels, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money".
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in a prolonged battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the elaborate design of the tunnel, investigators believe that it was designed by architects and engineers and took about a year to build.
The track was equipped to accommodate electrically powered carriages.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is in a building 80 meters from the border.
Authorities say a ladder leads 20 meters down to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would have been appropriate to encourage illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for marijuana seizure.
All three face a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, the San Diego press conference said.
It was the first time cocaine had been found in a tunnel.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA's San Diego office.
They'd do anything to get into the States.
No details were given of the arrested, but at least one was said to be Mexican.
You're looking at up to ten years in prison.
2014 will be the year of the Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer.
When the year ends in eight weeks, the anniversary year is upon us.
Geisingen and church-houses were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches, a document was made in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March, the anniversary year will officially begin, and as Geisingen currently has no hall, the opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
The anniversary will be marked by a number of events in Geisingen and in church buildings.
The Church House will celebrate 1250, on a weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate your return.
Friday with a celebration, Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the church hall.
This weekend is also the Church-House Church Festival.
The city's music director, Rudolf Barth, has written a commissioned composition for the city to be performed on three occasions.
On 21 June together with the sunset celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
The project will be completed and inaugurated in the year of the anniversary, the official date being the last weekend of September, the 27th and 28th.
A new chronicle will also be published on the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee.
"It is not just a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen", said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the ghost song of today is also celebrating its 2014 birthday, in 1974 the present space was completed with the enclosures.
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year of many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki Fool's Drink begins on February 8 with a traditional evening to celebrate its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 and has its festive banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a charter of donation in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The deed was made in churches (hausen), which were then courthouses.
The two municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for this 1250th anniversary in 2014 is to celebrate accordingly, in addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
Council takes aim at railway installations
Is the Am Hirschen railway crossing to be extensively reconstructed to improve traffic safety?
Yes, the city council has decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
The aim is to improve safety at railway crossings, where collisions between trains and other vehicles occur regularly throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion, they must share one third of the costs, the rest being shared by the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's town planner Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specifics of the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing.
The city plans to build a breakwater at the mouth of the tunnel west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting timber, could also be stopped by traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grishaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary retaining wall so that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversial in the municipal council, as some councillors questioned the need for a road extension: Thomas Kipp brought the mood of the critics to a head with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles?"
The mayor of the city, Thomas Haas, objected: the deer crossing is regularly used for transporting timber.
Even wood from the Kuhbach area is partly transported on this route because vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, where they could not turn into the main road.
The route also serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
As it is foreseeable that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels will have to be reconstructed and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the 'Am 'Hirschen' railway crossing could continue to be of important transport importance for a longer period.
The councils agreed to have an investigation into the costs of the proposed extension of the road.
Nevertheless, the majority of the voters approved the conversion of the railway crossing, provided that the necessary retaining wall was built in such a way that the city could extend the adjacent street towards the "Bahnhofstrasse" to around 5,5 metres for cross-country traffic, if necessary.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could create a completely different problem for access on the rapidly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the engineering office Breinlinger examine the plans for the conversion of the railway, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhauser Weg was then still possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be excluded that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles being used.
The responsibility for this rests with the city as the road builder.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the logging and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, the conversion of the railway crossing should not be approved, Haas argued.
The risk of a collision between the train and a vehicle at the crossing is also much lower at this point than at the other crossing points, because the centre stop is located right next to it and has good visibility.
Even trains from the central station would have to be so slow at this point that there is no risk of collision.
The majority of the council refused to approve the conversion of this railway crossing because the city of Schiltach would have to "eliminate" the problem of sitting vehicles, the councils said, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility once the construction work was completed.
The Committee considers that the conversions at the 'Vor Heubach' and 'Vor Kuhbach' railway crossings, for which interchange agreements have already been concluded with the railway, are not problematic.
ESA decides on major space missions: missions worth billions
Far-off planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years.
Thirty proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
Far away worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets around other stars.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is hard: Should we search for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover alien life?
These are the questions that the European Space Agency (ESA) is asking itself.
For their program Cosmic Vision, they are seeking ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for each of these L-missions is about one billion euro.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were discussed, five of which have now been narrowed down.
The proposals were reviewed by numerous committees and were followed by researchers.
A final decision by the Scientific Programme Committee is expected in the coming days.
The ESA has selected four main questions to be answered by the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes of star formation from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what conditions can life arise there?
To answer this question, the Cheops space telescope is scheduled to launch in 2017 to study 500 known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, however, and Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres to look for "biomarkers", gases that are thought to indicate biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to shed light on the conditions for the origin of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system play an important role.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied in an exemplary way.
The ESA has already approved an M-class mission (with a budget of about half a billion euro) to this end, the Solar Orbiter.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and will closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the evolution of the solar system.
The ESA is planning to launch the first of three L-missions under the Cosmic Vision programme.
The JUICE probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it will reach Jupiter to study its atmosphere and the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature that we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory that would unite all known laws of nature.
How did the universe come into being and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the big bang.
In addition to the matter we see in the universe, which is made up of stars, planets, and living things like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters together, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, researchers do not know what laws of physics were in effect in the first fractions of a second of the big bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are.
The ESA has already approved an M-mission with Euclid, which is scheduled to launch in 2020.
The purpose of the probe is to use a special telescope to study the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time across the entire sky, thus allowing conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Only two of the 30 proposals will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chance of being approved as an L-mission is, according to many experts, the E-Lisa, a sophisticated gravitational wave detection concept.
Physicists understand by this the changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisa could do it, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission will involve a detector consisting of two or three probes, which will be stationed in space.
Unlike earthly facilities, it could also detect gravitational waves from the Big Bang, providing new insights into the origin of the universe.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called Athena, which will investigate black holes, among other things; Icy Planets, another mission to the outer planets of the solar system; Prism, a mission to measure cosmic background radiation; and Exoplanet Finder, which will detect and study Earth-like planets.
Proposals have already been made for the return of samples from Mars, the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids, and solar physics.
Snowden willing to cooperate with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for the US intelligence service, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has received asylum, to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he wrote: Even though the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and tries to criminalize political speech under the threat of punishment where no defense is possible.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden says he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make it possible.
Relations between the United States and Germany are strained by allegations that the NSA has been listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness should be taken if possible 'without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US'.
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden is to testify in Germany, he needs assurances that he is "safe" there, the MEP said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he is facing a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that has driven him from his homeland.
He was, however, touched by the worldwide reaction to my act of political expression.
Citizens around the world and high-ranking politicians  including in the United States  have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of widespread surveillance a public service.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities cooperation if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation are resolved.
Frontier Airlines is charging for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday said passengers can keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.
Frontier said it charges $25 for prepayment and $100 for those who pay at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at encouraging travelers to take care of payment in advance.
We do not wish to charge this sum, she explained.
In 2008, airlines started charging fees for first and second checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to avoid them crammed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which often caused the overhead compartments to be overcrowded.
Charges are a way of persuading passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
These are Frontier's most loyal customers, who would have made it clear that it's getting harder and harder to find space in the overhead bin.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the Frontier flight deck may be allowed to take one piece of luggage for free, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the airport.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee doesn't go into effect until the summer, no date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines are happy to resort to them.
They argue that the transport of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are earning enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most still ignore the charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and later Allegiant Air, another low-cost carrier, followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand luggage fee generates $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who used to be a senior executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew Spirit and was curious about what would happen to him on the flight deck if passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand luggage charge.
The boarding process was one of the smoothest I've experienced in my career in aviation, he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and hands-on discussions on the tarmac.
"The plane was full", he explained, "and boarding went smoothly".
Frontier Spirit is also second in the $2 charged for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice could keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company followed up.
Frontiers' move to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agents like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all societies to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of through an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to give only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the mileage was cut again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A third-party flight with a Frontier over 1,000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also book seats exclusively when purchasing directly from Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and airline capacity declined nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to get control of Frontier's finances as part of the company's sale.
Proverbs From the Bible
Some 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year in the bishopric of Bisingen.
The theme of the day at the parish hall was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Middle Ages Rhetoric".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the president of the church council, spoke on the Bible proverbs.
"Proverbs contain life-giving wisdom, precepts, or warnings", she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible verses and explained their meaning.
She used to say, "Let the wooden eye be watchful, like the scales falling from the eyes, an eye cast on someone, the Lord gives to His own in sleep, washing his hands in innocence".
The speaker also asked her listeners to guess which proverb it was.
The Church parish priestess Christel Dehner adopted the saying from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, to make a mess, to blow something up.
She explained the meaning and origin of the expressions she called "bridges to the past".
At the end, a raffle was drawn.
The prizes were laid flat on a table and were humorously described before being handed out to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was also mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of not working: pilot project for unskilled tourists
A pilot project for the tourism sector is being launched at the Mecklenburg Lakes Plate.
The Federal Labour Agency will over three winters train 49 women and men who are already unskilled in the industry to become hotel and restaurant professionals.
"What is new is that the six-month courses end with diplomas", said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are many: participants would not be out of work, companies would have trained workers who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA says it's an "internal error" and not hackers that caused the crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a bug had paralyzed its public website for several hours, and not hackers, as was claimed online.
NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error during a scheduled update, the spy agency said in an e-mailed message.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours and still isn't for some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not compromised in any way".
The spokesman said that no secret information was at risk.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have disabled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In this type of attack, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website crashes.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the target system's internal network.
The formerly super-secret NSA, once nicknamed the No Such Agency, is now in the public eye and facing fierce criticism at home and abroad following revelations in recent months about its extensive surveillance program, a result of the NSA's classified data stolen and released by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that today's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of unemployed fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate is better than last year's 3.1 percent and even better than in September, "we had hoped for more", says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy director of the Sonthofen Labour Agency.
This is because many companies have responded to hiring behaviour.
One reason, says Felder-Bauer, is that "we have few skilled workers in the craft, health care and nursing industries".
The seasonal situation has also led to job vacancies in the hotel and catering sector starting in September.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäu Advertising Bulletin of 31 October 2013 (page 33).
Losses in Bombardier's profits following decreases in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after coming under pressure from falling aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial service as planned next September.
The first long-range flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago was followed by only three more launches, which makes it questionable whether the test phase will go as planned.
The results fell short of expectations and led to a drop of over eight percent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen lowered his rating of "outperform" to "sector perform" on Thursday, citing limited potential for the stock over the next one to two quarters.
While weaker aircraft deliveries were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector, Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test programme for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, binding orders for the CSeries 177 are moderate so far as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests and want to see if the company's claims about the fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet are true.
The Commission has received a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the airline's operations are not affected by the new rules.
The company's management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was on schedule.
The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected, Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been scheduled during the aircraft's service life.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and then add a work-over period, which we did.
This is happening throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks, the remainder shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts remain skeptical that a CSeries aircraft will be able to enter service 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was reviewing the EIS and would update it in the coming months.
The slow progress of the flight tests  even if they are clearly in line with Bombardier's internal planning  reinforces our view that the start-up will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015, said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended 30 September, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share from $172 million or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remain at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents a share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion at 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
In the aerospace sector, the results were within our expectations, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing, said Beaudoin.
The aerospace business fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railroad manufacturer, announced that sales in this division increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The volume of orders in the transport sector was $32.6 billion at 30 September, up slightly on 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares fell 8.5 percent in Thursday afternoon trading to $4.83 after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette will join the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown gunman opened fire at LAX Airport Friday morning.
While airport officials announced via Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is being kept informed of the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, with eyewitnesses reporting seeing a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure lounges, according to multiple media reports.
A traveler told CNN that many people had panicked and sought refuge.
Travelers would have cried and children would have cried.
The waiters were in a panic, many hiding behind chairs.
He heard two shots, a traveler told the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA employee reportedly suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was "like a movie".
Afterward, he was taken to a security area, the man said.
The shots were fired near a security checkpoint.
Airport buildings evacuated
Television footage showed numerous ambulance and police cars pulling up in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people have been evacuated from the building.
Twitter users posted photos of a special operations unit and a rifle lying on the ground.
The airport administration said on Twitter that the incident began at 9:30 a.m. local time.
The roads were closed, causing long traffic jams, according to CNN.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
However, CNN also showed several planes taking off.
The Commission notes that the airport is located in the southern part of the country.
LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine addict lawyer who warned drug lord about police investigation goes to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information to underworld figure Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come out
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .
A prominent criminal defense attorney who warned a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug habit might be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld figure Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug-trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash, hailed by criminologists as "a top-notch" lawyer, was arrested in 2011 at his home after police raided Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officials observed Scarborough, 32, delivering three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was having a bar dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
All four suspects were then under police surveillance as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested along with 32 others after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed information to the criminals because he was afraid his drug addiction would be made public.
Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced today at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted to possession of cocaine in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after police investigating Scarborough found that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house, where he placed the 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough was on the phone regularly with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer went home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
Ditta was identified in court as a "regular cocaine user" after tests found Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied taking cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed their discussion was subject to "attorney-client privilege".
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
During police interrogation, he stated that he had an office at both his home and workplace and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was revealed that he had called key drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law".
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney by getting too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but that of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the advocate for these individuals.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal lawyer-client relationship.
It was as much as possible a deterrent to police investigations, allowing them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta has thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing, saying, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, I would do it now".
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: Mr Ditta made the leap from criminal to criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organised crime.
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and create trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta, which also resulted in convictions in three cases for cocaine possession and obstruction of justice, underscoring our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to traffic heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other drug traffickers were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta posted a Q&amp;A section about himself, in which he said his dream job was to be a death row lawyer in America, his ultimate dinner guest was Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
A Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To mark the celebrations of its 160th anniversary, the Dunningen Song Crown will be framed by two services with Franz Schubert's "German Mass".
Following the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which delighted the audience in the spring of this year, the song cycle will conclude the anniversary year with two services with the performance of Franz Schubert's German Mass.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 7 p.m. during the evening Mass in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. during the service in St. John the Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass, originally titled "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass will be performed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the wind band of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism is giving way to confidence
The parish council elections in 2015 will bring about fundamental changes in the parish ministry unit Haslach (SE).
There will then be only one common parish council for all six parishes.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The basic decisions of the diocese cannot be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
The day was particularly marked by the change from skepticism to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations for the innovations of 2015 to concrete proposals for the future composition and size of the parish council, the six committees held highly constructive discussions with the heads of the spiritual leadership team.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt gave a presentation on the new guidelines for parish units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
The SE Haslach will therefore be a public body, which will take over the rights and duties of the six individual parishes.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council, in which the parish priest will be represented on an official basis.
Each parish should have at least two elected members, and local so-called community teams are formed in the six parishes.
Their task will be to promote the church life in the village.
The question of the finances of each parish community was then a major need for discussion.
The new rules provide that accumulated funds in parishes remain assigned to their purpose.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the community as a whole.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
"In the past too, only projects that could be handled by the individual parishes alone were invested in", said Haslach's parish council president Bruno Prinzbach.
Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the committee in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried, described practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes.
They had set themselves the task in 2006 to "one to go, five to stay", and they had to realize that it's not that easy.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral unit then set about answering questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the parish teams.
The Commission will be able to take a decision on the drafting of the draft directive by the end of the year.
At the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Electricity is going up in Pfullendorf
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the municipal authorities, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a family of four in Pfullendorf has an extra cost of between 70 and 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 cents to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is fixed again each year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
They quantify the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can charge by a levy on the price of electricity.
The Pfullendorf municipal works are the last link in this chain.
The energy company's supervisory board even predicted a higher premium, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the price increases are not too high.
"We are assuming a 1 cent plus x increase", says Bias, with the figure likely to be closer to 2 cents.
Red light: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn't turn green.
The circuit breaker in the street doesn't respond, or the light sign is broken.
What do you do then, drive on red?
If a person waits long enough at a red light and the intersection is clear, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid.
Becker advises waiting at least five minutes before assuming a malfunction of the light.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of workers from the risks of road accidents.
If you wait less than five minutes, you may not be waiting long enough, Becker warns, referring to a decision by the Hamm High Court.
In the case at hand, a driver had ignored the red light after about three minutes of continuous traffic and had to answer for negligent red-light violation.
The traffic light was not broken, but went green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not a fine.
Municipal Council welcomes sound budget
Whenever the budget is discussed at city council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal savings bank in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not been in debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be described as a success in this respect.
This was made clear when the 2012 annual accounts were presented.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was about EUR 7.6 million, over EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at about EUR 1.8 million, is also about EUR 1 million above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The assets budget was also again well above the planned values.
Instead of the 1.5 million euros planned, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget", Rothmund says.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the amount of the aid.
In total, the general reserve was increased by some EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"You don't just shake off a job like this", Gerster said, referring to the annual report.
He and the city council were visibly happy about the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon come at a cost to the citizens.
The good financial situation has enabled the municipality to avoid high borrowing costs in the past.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the aid is granted in accordance with the rules of the common agricultural policy.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting charges because in the coming years we will have to invest and we would like to have subsidies for this", Gerster announced in this context.
Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years.
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history at the men's choir Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colors of his men's choir.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the now-loved choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a committee member.
For his commitment and dedication to the association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral consultant on behalf of the Cæcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choir Association and an engraved tinplate.
In addition to the ceremony, the 31st Autumn Festival was held in the usual way: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkrans Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music association, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
They also prepared a small stand in honour of their singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's choir Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal".
The Salzstetten choir, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impulse choir" - provided the women's share of the festival.
The mixed choir used the Neapolitan folk songs "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus to travel abroad, while the "Impulse Choir" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to the home countryside with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side programme - "Granny Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl theatre and read a few stories, which kept the children busy during the afternoon.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centers in the customs district are getting mail these days.
The Black Forest Messenger wants to support the institutions in the implementation of their building and beautification wishes in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
The action is open to all kindergartens, day-care centres and nurseries in the entire district of Cullera.
If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with this one to the Black Forest Agency.
Be creative with your kids and surprise the jury of the Action Kindergarten construction site.
A jury, made up of representatives from Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, will select three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The request should be made with construction materials worth up to EUR 2000 and in one (action) day.
In addition, the winner must provide many hardworking construction workers himself.
What's with the action day and the helpers?
Bauhaus is providing the material with the support of the Savings Bank Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the nursery on the day agreed and then handled directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and the children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: What is stopping Parliament from abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?, read the newspaper, which considered the draft law unconstitutional.
The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it, said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also owns CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament, he said.
The Star newspaper said the new law "effectively strangles the media", but The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya "had taken a heavy hit" and called the bill "draconian".
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the September attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media drew the ire of the authorities for publishing security camera footage showing the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbing the luxury shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a senior media official to be questioned, though the summons was withdrawn after a media outcry.
The new law could impose fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings on media houses and up to a million on individual journalists, as well as the risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single fine can bankrupt most radio stations".
The newspaper also believes these measures could have a devastating impact on what it describes as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
If they shut down the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the Nation, who described the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
If politicians are left to their own devices, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and take us back to the hunter-gatherer era, he commented.
The Kenyan legislature has in the past caused public outrage.
In May, they voted to reverse cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and restore their plentiful salaries of about 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: a dream come true for the FC
The official dedication ceremony for the artificial turf stadium did not diminish its importance for the city and the football club, despite the cold weather and the rain.
Last Saturday, everyone had hoped for a more pleasant celebration, but Peter did not want to play along.
So it was with all those who came without umbrellas or who for some reason could not keep one.
The musicians who framed the celebration felt that way, as did many of the speakers.
The FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker was also very excited about the achievement of a dream.
He thanked in particular the Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very involved in the project, the local council, the companies involved and the members of the association who contributed.
This is Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The well-to-do retirees laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also acknowledged by Karl Rombach, a member of the Landtag.
Other greetings from the city's sports committee were given by Hubert Baier, the district president of the South Badia Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn made the original lawn unplayable.
The first considerations to solve the problem were made 15 years ago when the idea of building a third venue on the site of the football club or the Real School on the Salinessee was considered.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas for an artificial turf sports ground came to mind, and this was widely considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning began two years ago when the FC took over the football pitch in Erblecht, pledged a contribution of EUR 100 000 to the construction of the ground and approved a grant of EUR 104 000.
The municipality decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 of the total costs of EUR 560,000, Klumpp summarised.
Construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial turf pitch began on June 4.
During the construction phase, which lasted over three months, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used to build a dirt bike path.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations on the internal affairs and justice.
The working party in charge met in Berlin in the morning.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The working party on migration and integration also wanted to continue its discussions in the morning.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU citizens in the EU.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
The Socialist Group has supported the Commission's proposal to increase the number of road users in the Community.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
The risk of evasive traffic on country roads, which are already major accident areas, was high.
The introduction of a toll on all cars would also be only a first step, in Pronold's view.
"There is a risk that at a later stage the compensation for Germans will be cancelled", he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing funnel wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not the question on Friday evening at the Killesberg open-air stage.
It was a truly tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for a hit star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Motorist seriously injured in accident
A 37-year-old driver of a car from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a 41-year-old woman from Müsch was driving her car towards Grefrath at about 21.15 on the Kempener Außenring.
When she tried to turn left onto St. Töniser Street, she overlooked the 37-year-old's oncoming car.
The trailers collided.
The Aachen man suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
Constance: closure following accident at the Schönzlekreisel
The accident, according to police, occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza was driving out of the city on the left lane of the two-lane Reichsstraße on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand lane heading towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right-hand lane.
The accident involved a 23-year-old Constance's BMW.
Also damaged was a 19-year-old VW Passat behind the BMW.
In total, about 15,000 property damage was reported, the police said.
The road had to be closed during the shooting, it said.
Vienna Airport to abolish passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please report to Gate 24.
We must not forget that the European Parliament has a duty to ensure that the European Parliament is represented in the European Parliament.
This eliminates much of the speaker's performance - the noise level is thus significantly reduced.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend by ceasing issuing orders affecting individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai are already dispensing with noisy calls.
The elimination of these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls are made through the loudspeakers each day - will make it quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual announcements were relatively little noticed, but at the same time all other information about changed boarding or departure times is a bit lost here", Kleemann told the radio station.
Highlander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the tractor pulling, a second competition will be held at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
Saturday, September 7th, at 1:30 p.m., the Highlander Games are underway.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they're Swabian in Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual competitors compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The trunk is six feet [4.5 m] long and weighs about 40 to 50 pounds [25 to 30 kg].
"It's not about the size", explains organiser Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown vertically, must overturn once, and then lie down straight.
That's the one that gets the most points.
When throwing horseshoes, the point is accuracy.
From eight meters away, a stick is thrown at it.
Competitors must demonstrate skill and strength in carrying water buckets over 50 metres.
Time and quantity of water in a vessel are measured at the end.
Two of each clan or team will then be allowed to compete individually.
The winners of the team and individual competitions will receive prizes.
You can start training at 10 a.m.
Appropriate clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors may compete in a scottish skirt.
But Swabian dress is also allowed.
The jury will award a few extra points for "Outfit".
Registration is open up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling starting half an hour early, there's plenty of action on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, the wind-music friends come to their own expense.
At 7 p.m. the Barah Bohemian wind music from Schömberg will make the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, who is known as the singing host and black sausage baron, will be there.
He's already performed at the Christmas market and the Fool's Drink in Dornhan.
On Sundays, the Music Association will entertain Leinstetten for the early morning kick, from 2 p.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffingen will be a guest, and the "Oldies" will then bring the party to a close.
The stop-and-go party with DJ Ralf starts on Friday.
Other events on Saturday and Sunday include the Oldtimer and Trailer Meeting, exhibitions of companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn maze, the craftsman market, and sheep shearing.
There is a petting zoo, a straw jump for children, tractor riding (with guidance) and tractor surfing.
The event is organised by the Multipurpose Hall Association, the Ski Club and the Tractor Friends "Trigger Capsules".
Milk and egg alternatives in the review
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
For example, pureed tofu with vegetable cream is a substitute for quark.
The Vegetarian Federation also calls for World Vegetarian Day on 1 November.
The German Vegetarian Association is proposing a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of World Vegetarian Day on 1 November:
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Milk can be replaced by soy, oat, almond or rice milk.
The use of vegetable cream replaces conventional cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half-crushed, ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
A half ounce of apple corn or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water may also be suitable.
Instead of egg, make dough with a mixture of, say, a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of starch, and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can serve this purpose.
According to Vebu, about 800 000 people in Germany are currently vegan, i.e. eating purely from plants.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of Black Forest High School got to know the American metropolis of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, we headed straight for the Brooklyn Bridge, which led to the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here, you can enjoy a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
The time difference kept the students up almost 24 hours, but in keeping with the motto "The city never sleeps", the day was decided on Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was reached by ferry and climbed on foot on the second day.
Then we went over the financial center and around Wall Street to the 9/11 Memorial.
On the third day, the students were able to enjoy a view of the city from the 373-meter-high observation deck of the Empire State Building.
Then we drove through the bustle of New York City's streets, through Rockefeller Center, and on to Central Park, an ideal spot to bask in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and are experiencing the school day at Weymouth High School.
This year, too, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on the name day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Hunting Horn Blowers Group of the Westphalian Hunting Riders under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on Parforcehorns (Naturehorns in the mood of Es) to old, originally French tunes.
The windmills wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog-herds on towing trips.
The solemn mass will be celebrated on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed cover shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One who wants to make the name a program.
A psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before is called déjà vu.
The café of the same name at the top of the hill in the county town of Kleve, within sight of the Rhine-Waal University, is not just a Déjà Vu experience.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that in mind: to make an actual stay not only mental but tangible and repeatedly experienced.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A glimpse into the inner life of the 8th edition gives the viewer a good feeling at once.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool, café environment looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team, led by founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner, will treat guests to a variety of coffee and cocktail options.
There's delicious cakes or individually baked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, had already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before opening the elegant café on the Opschlag: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the auction, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least through college.
"We do not have a specific target group", says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here want to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The lovely owners are behind the coffee treat.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in its various variations yourself.
Other, including mixtures of natural rubber
Daniel Büttner is more of an espresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"I'm into baguettes", she tells NRZ.
There were two events at the bright café.
I'd say one.
The harbour party was held outside, and the Déjà Vu Café was not benefiting from it.
But there was also the wrestling night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", the 33-year-old couple said.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that is why Daniel Büttner is not a big fan of event nights: "You can't make everyone right".
And I always go with an event to only those who are interested in the specific event.
So events are going to be the exception here.
"We want to disrupt normal operations as little as possible".
I mean, déjà vu also means reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the clearing in Kleve.
The street that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
The event was a great success for many Klever guests, visitors from far and wide and students who are discovering the cuisine and the Déjà Vu Café.
The Commission shall be assisted by the European Parliament.
A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the clubhouse of the Witteborg restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness entirely in the spirit of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Day is also the appropriate occasion to pay tribute.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was this time given to the composer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written a lot for us, but also made a lot of recordings for us, for which we thank you very much", says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity strips went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participants this year, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
In fifth place was Artur Brückner.
The board of directors thanked the team of the association's host Ange Pier-Ribbert for once again creating a top-class menu and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decorations.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choral rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. in the clubhouse.
"We are always happy to welcome new singing voices", says Schlotmann.
UN announces new goals for poverty alleviation
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction announced 12 years ago.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off in Rio de Janeiro this evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the 'Sustainable Development Goals' to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document to be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared at the summit that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
I am pleased that Member States have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal sustainable development goals, he said.
These goals will build on our progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the Millennium Development Goals.
Even though the SG Achim/Baden have been without a win for four days, the handball champions continue to have a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone remains fully motivated in the cause.
I hope we can win again.
"Because I don't know what a victory like this tastes like anymore", Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-tier reserve from Fredenbeck has not uprooted any trees yet, Malmon is raising his index finger in advance.
I've coached a lot of players myself in the A-team.
So they're gonna be very motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also important to wait and see if there will be reinforcements from the first team", explains the SG-Coach.
To finally get back on track, the Malmon team will definitely need to step up from their previous performances.
Most of all, the cover and the switch game have been a mess lately.
The use of opportunities must also be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their heads clear during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique rise amid clashes between powerful figures
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, to shout peace in a rare public demonstration.
We want peace back, we want stability, said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Fearing for the country's future, she traded her business clothes for a T-shirt that read "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks now, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, supported initially by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts say it is unlikely the country will fall back into full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
The stakes for the fast-growing economy are high, as the discovery of vast offshore gas deposits and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in over $50 billion in investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and the US' Anadarko.
The governing Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a "loser" who wants to "use all his remaining strength to prove he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace deal.
He explained to FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
Our vision is to resume negotiations in earnest, Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) banging their heads together, says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the November municipal elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza  is due to resign when his second term ends next year  to destroy the country's democracy.
He does not want multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency, Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out rioting attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south route.
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala province, a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but it is also home to Beira, the port used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended railway use for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga was reticent when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique, Mazanga said.
The instability has added to the frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people are already worried about corruption, slow progress in development, and a recent wave of kidnappings.
People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems, he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people simply wanted stability.
Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again, he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life", says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that brute force has no chance against clever tricks, and the Arthur legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
However, many of the myths are 'far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools', which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a 'careful selection' of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been proposing this plan for 20 years.
He added that authors and teachers who are 'overly didactic' would 'turn children off completely', because in entertaining stories the messages would be 'under the surface'.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible.
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of right and wrong.
It must be sublimated, revealed by history, not explained.
That's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves once again to the free yard
One hundred years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob retired to Haslach, and on Sunday, his final years came alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining stage play.
From the moment of his arrival to the moment of his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining play, which was highly acclaimed by the audience.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience through the ten different scenes as a speaker, explaining the connections and bridging the gaps from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's heaven, to his free yard.
And then the stage play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his role as the parader of the city.
He was driving with the two-spanner and "Black Forest Foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he greeted with applause by the audience, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann was incredibly good at putting himself in the role of the sister, giving her a huge life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbach Peasant Band played appropriately selected pieces of music, completing the performance.
The honorary citizenship was then conferred on Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler, who attended on behalf of the then office holder Hättich along with part of the city council.
Their presence was then made so by the Three Kings Singers that Hansa Jacob exclaimed: "Oh, how beautiful, the youthful memories of my own Three Kings time come alive again".
With their song "O Jesuslein", they delighted the audience in the courtyard, as did the Stork Day Children with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time as well as his concerns about the expansion of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In his homeland, behind his burning tomb chapel at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found peace and gone home for good", the scene concluded.
There was much applause and many words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Neckar giants hope is growing
The chances of the relegated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players staying in the league have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard system, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers has decided not to apply for a possible relegation zone.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure", said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg, however.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it was clear that Düsseldorf would not get a license", Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until May 23, the newcomer of Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and prove his economic fitness for the Bundesliga.
The Rhinelands have been refused the licence twice so far.
The arbitration court is the court of last resort.
Haigerloch: Church of the Eucharist in the spotlight
As a contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's Cultural and Tourism Office is dedicating the last of its public themed tours this year to the Church of the Last Supper on Sunday, October 27.
After visiting the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Haigerloch period after 1850 will be considered, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The culminating point is a visit to the Church of the Last Supper.
The guides will learn about the history of the church's construction and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.
Not least in the church is the view of the painting of the Last Supper created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model by Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the second half-hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomic Celler Museum.
There are maps at the cashier at the Atomic Basement Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is at your disposal.
Snowden could testify in Russia .
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could be making statements in the US spy case even in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax news agency, citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Snowden's exit from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status", the agency quoted its source as saying.
The German government has been accused of being a "spoiler" for the US.
Long breaths are worthwhile
Six men's teams competed for the title in the club tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the final match.
A dream weatherman had received the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was the focus of the tournament.
There were five games per team, with each team playing against each other.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlitter is the tournament director.
The tournament management was in the hands of Anja Schliter, assisted by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were level on points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both SG Rohrweiler teams), so the last two matches had to decide.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was taken by the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze ladder was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team of asphalt cutters.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful closing of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Open Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in children's hands.
The museum traditionally welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday programme, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Children and adults can learn various old crafts on both days", says the press release.
Whether making soap, spinning candles, filleting, or making ropes, there is something for every age.
Regional craftsmen are on hand to help the children from 11 to 5.
The museum's workshop is also working.
The young guests can demonstrate their skills in the construction of cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing and trotters, also promise much fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 and 14 o'clock each.
On a curb walk, the children must guess which stories are true or false.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be seen and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to seeing Clown Otsch on Sundays, when he will play his shrew-mocking game with the museum guests from 11 a.m. onwards.
Meanwhile, things are going smoothly and fairly at Hermann Büttner's.
The storyteller takes the little guests at 11, 13 and 3 o'clock into the wonderful world of fairy tales.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutah performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
On both days, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., you can also see many craftsmen, such as the broom-binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker, doing their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum will be treated to a varied holiday programme.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable cause because he has decided to race his 1920 motorcycle in America.
Burt's heart is a little broken, but he's not gonna let that stop him from living his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old garage, he sails to Los Angeles.
After the movie, there's coffee, tea and cake.
A loud whistle disturbs the residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They're distributing the coal coming from the ships to the bunker.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is also focusing on logistics for wind turbines.
The coal on the storage area in front of the dam is shining black.
Two huge blue dump and reloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the envelopes move, a squeaky alarm sounds across the grounds.
"The signals are for safety and are required by law", says Matthias Schrell, managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in bad weather, this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, technical measures are now being taken to reduce the noise of the warning signals.
He will continue to focus on open dialogue with neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot of work to do at the site.
With the extension of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power stations and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
The 18.5 metre deep berth in front of the terminal has long made it possible to handle Capesize bulk carriers here.
"This year we want to break the 3 million tonne mark", says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power station on site, the imported coal goes to power plants inland.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Community coal mines in the Community by a further 5 million tonnes.
The three ship dispatchers on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could provide up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball players are optimistic despite their first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can stop us from believing that we can win against the best team in Europe in the last two years", Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening against defending champions Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message that there is basketball in Munich too!
In their third appearance in the European King class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The visitors first managed to turn a 15-point lead 13 minutes from the end into a lead before Piraeus turned the game around again.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made reckless mistakes", said Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munich side, who had won significant victories in the first two games against Italian champions Montepaschi Siena and Polish title holders Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years of the New York comedy festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety performer Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then got more and more successful until they were too famous to perform in a club", Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we could continue to work with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy benefit for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians participating in this year's festival have become known through more unconventional channels, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known for a cable sitcom (the ironically whimsical fantasy football series The League on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a cast member on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, though she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, race-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest attractions of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show titled Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg on TV Land.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here".
Iran satisfied with nuclear negotiation process
Iran is showing a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany that it is satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we have now reached an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years", Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill playmates with machetes
Two children in Uruguay have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two boys, ages 14 and 12, had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported El País newspaper on Thursday.
They were then reported to have been playing football outside their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, the five-year-old half-sister of the younger boy they had taken away was to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl told the police about the incident without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted to killing the 11-year-old deliberately.
The older brother cited a rivalry in football as one reason.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth home.
Pimps go to jail
For exploitative trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm, the District Court of Constance has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. George to three and a half years in prison.
The former German soldier, who worked as a doorman after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession in a plea bargain.
He said he met five women over the Internet or on the phone and then dumped them after a few weeks.
He used violence and threats to break up resistance.
He kept the income of the women, some of whom had been working for him for years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he cut off the women's contact with the outside world.
He and a colleague who was a sex worker took the women to various brothels in the Southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert raised serious doubts about the mental limitation and thus limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a full confession.
The court did not have to hear any more of the injured women.
A Kripo official reported that after an initial report, telephone surveillance measures had identified at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking.
The intercepted conversations were characterized by high aggression.
In subsequent interrogations, the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, who saw bruises all over her body, has not yet testified.
He is described as having a "completely broken personality" and as viewing violence and exploitation as normal in the profession.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has broken free of these circles and wants to live a normal life after prison", he said.
Oil price continues to fall to $ 96 a barrel
Oil prices fell further on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The benchmark crude oil for December deliveries fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late morning electronic trading in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8 percent drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Within five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were signs of stronger demand from two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop and search policy
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked an order by a judge who had sought changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program, releasing the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be stayed pending a decision on the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by the way it implemented the detention and interrogation program.
The City appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their policy and training programme.
The appeals court heard arguments for the suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by requiring a judge to avoid the appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by inappropriately targeting black and Hispanic men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in policies, training and oversight, and ordered a pilot programme of body-worn cameras in neighbourhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
The City's appeal hearing is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights activists.
Such controls have existed in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic men, during the tenure of nonpartisan Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
In 2004, four men from all minorities filed a lawsuit that became a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police departments use the program.
Opponents say the changes would reduce police morale but not crime, waste money and fail to solve the broader problem of police, which has been under pressure since thousands of jobs were cut in the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but was simply reforming the way the NYPD implemented the checks.
From the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreamy camels can reach.
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the Helping Hands Association.
On Saturday afternoon the tenth anniversary of the club was celebrated, which has already achieved considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, gave a detailed report on the work of the association.
He himself visited Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Sheikh Zayed Hospital in Nouakchott.
In the following years, further cooperation developed and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the operations were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also on display.
It's a former Federal Border Patrol vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans to become a consultant to the association, according to Henne.
In 2008, the Bavarian carpenter Schleeh built the hospital in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in a record time of just under a week - voluntarily.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when Nagold is planning to streamline the maternity clinic.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, slowing down against burnout.
Because of the political unrest in the country, travel was limited, but many doctors came to Germany to work in various fields.
Containers of medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses are also regularly being sent to Africa.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself brought a lot of local colour to the event, telling stories of Mercedes cars converted from Mauritania into mobile goat pens and the experiences of the local musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritania trip.
He cited his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of Parliament as his personal motives.
When he realized how much money was being lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should also be borne in mind that Africa is closer than some people think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify a tip
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemails and stalked her, but Coulson also called her and left messages, as the court learned.
In the opinion of the prosecution, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not someone who stands outside people's homes hoping to catch them in the act, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction, Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second one, the surveillance, but it can't be any other way.
How's the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And did he know about it?"
Rumors of an affair with Clarkes were first picked up by NotW's feature editorial staff when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
A tape of voicemails from her phone from at least three occasions was seized at Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the time the search was going on, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following message: "I have a story we want to publish tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about".
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman when he was himself having an affair with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking the phone.
In protest of the planned imperial tax, French football will actually go on strike for the first time since 1972.
A mediation meeting ends without result.
In the conflict over the imperial tax, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred into a dead end after a failed mediation meeting.
President Hollande welcomed representatives of associations and organizations at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
He refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than a million euros a year that all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side was also tough.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, the head of the Union of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, said.
The matchdays scheduled for 29 November to 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are therefore cancelled.
Gachingen: No protection at all
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning process", opened Mayor Jens Häußler the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the town hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and offer ideas.
Heusler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009 was a watershed event that raised the question of future protection measures, Häusler said.
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many built-up areas as possible", says Häußler.
The basis for the planning is protection against a flood which, according to the German weather service, is expected to occur every 100 years.
The climate change is being taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles this is known as "HQ 100aKlima".
The floods that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement", says Häußler.
The HQ 100aKlima protection requires an investment of around EUR 4 million in Gechingen, with the municipality receiving state subsidies of around 70%.
However, Häusler pointed out that the funding was only possible if an overall concept was implemented.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the new rules.
In the best case scenario, implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the protection plan presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the Irm river basin from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and reservoirs were not planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner at the commissioned engineering office Wald und Corbe in Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it requires the interaction of all the proposed measures to achieve the desired goal.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The people who live near the altar were angry, for even during normal thunderstorms the canal network is constantly overloaded.
The problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the directives for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the sewerage network in such a way that it can withstand two to three years of rainfall.
If the sewers were to be enlarged, millions would be swallowed.
Serious injuries after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on State Road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but at first they could say little about the accident.
However, there are various witnesses who should be evaluated first.
It is certain that the 19-year-old woman was driving a VW Golf towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her in his Hyundai.
The two vehicles collided, with the woman so trapped that it took the fire department almost half an hour to pull her out of the wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The road remained closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, and his novels and stories have something of a serial.
The outward kinship is startling: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published by the Heyne publishing house, and the Haffmans cassette with 118 stories sells two thousand copies.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress coupled with paranoia, security craze and the belief of being the chosen one.
Dick had a spiritual experience, his later books read like a mixture of the Apocalypse and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugged his brain.
He realized early on that computers are gods.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguished a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the problem with Blade Runner.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The Minority Report is from 1956, it smells like the Cold War and the McCarthy trials.
The principle of pre-crime is being developed here, pre-crime, which is now more or less official White House doctrine.
In Dick's world, which is eerily similar to ours, mutants look to the future and the police step in.
"We arrest individuals who have not broken any laws", says the head of the agency.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime".
And, "We don't have any felons in our society, but we do have a prison camp full of offenders".
They assume that bad things will happen, and they prevent the criminal thought from being turned into action.
Dick's story seems to be the blueprint for the counterterrorism laws and the NSA wiretap.
Anticipating the attack: That's how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story is not over.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls the day-to-day - and what's left of the state.
Then the watchman himself is watched and convicted of a future crime.
The system's going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own conditions.
Not only does it accept mistakes and sacrifices, it builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick is about getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Spying affair around Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US spy affair surrounding German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, Interfax news agency reported.
Earlier, the Green member of the Bundestag, Hans-Christian Ströbele, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to discuss the affair.
NSA leaks increase corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German domestic intelligence service, he was to photograph the roof of the US Post Office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance equipment and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US would not use foreign espionage to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits.
But ever since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower turned employee, began leaking his stuff on U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are not sure they can trust the director.
Reports that the US National Security Agency is spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have raised the company's paranoia about government surveillance to a new high.
The barrel overflowed when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely corporate leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between US intelligence and corporate transparency.
I think it's conceivable that this data could be used for mutual benefit.
Germany needs to wake up, says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the US now poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consultancy EY.
However, the documents leaked by Snowden have so far found no evidence that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
The German Bundestag has proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
It doesn't work that way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything but the IT business.
Yet the reach and technical sophistication of the US intelligence agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change as European business leaders become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to US jurisdiction and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade organization, after revelations about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director at SAP, says: We are seeing a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago : Where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will stay physically in this jurisdiction?
Many German business leaders feel that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must guard them at all costs.
It's no surprise that there's economic espionage going on.
It's always been like this.
It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally from the current discussion, says Kurt Bock, chairman of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are doing, because it is in our national interest to defend our companies.
The management usually does not brag about the countermeasures they have taken, because this gives the attackers an advantage.
Employees at large companies have long been told that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick to a trade show or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at carmaker Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in their respective niche.
SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets from unauthorised access, warns the BVT in a report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in February's US National Intelligence Estimates, France, Russia and Israel ranked second behind China in the countries that used hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to business espionage, the French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: The intelligence services know full well that all countries, even when cooperating in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.
The European Commission has published a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of personal data.
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake", said the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard.
Tips, at least how to succeed the wedding celebration, gave now a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
The wedding was represented by important vendors.
A trend: the retro look is back.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, preferably covered or in cream.
The often-rigged and embroidered garments are closed in front, often with a veil, while in the back they go down the back and often end in a drawer.
However, the spirits are divided, as Stefanie Koch of the clothing house Müller points out.
Men's suits are predominantly vest and plastron, but cream or brown combinations are also available.
The choice of venue was important, he explained.
Unadorned side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain called attention to its own offer in the discount.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"But carriages are also popular for bridal shower", he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, floral arrangements, and even wedding pictures.
"After-wedding photography" - a series of photos taken in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the wedding, but in wedding clothes - is becoming more fashionable, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding table, cake and even a magician, like Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention proper cosmetics and nail care.
Anything for a party you won't forget.
Dog Friends Successfully
Once again, the Dog Friends of Bitz were successful in a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15 month old Marley he took it to twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp faced the critical eye of the judge with her Woody in first grade.
Parents of Georgia teenager killed in tragic accident believe murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym are convinced their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the school's gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family has doubts.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered", Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson's lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
You never would have believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.
They believe it is without logic, against the laws of physics and against common sense, says Crump.
Rather, they feel that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
"His son went to school to learn and came back in a body bag", he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death because a number of important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death a crime?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, no matter where they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died from the effects of "position-related asphyxiation".
A second autopsy, however, found a different cause of death, Moore said.
There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed, he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative from the county sheriff's department was not immediately available for comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered that authorities release all surveillance video that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage would provide clues as to how he died.
CDC releases allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-aged children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The CDC reports that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools stock epiphrine  the EpiPen branded auto-injection is most commonly used  to help prevent a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators recently changed regulations to make it easier for schools to stockpile epinephrine.
The report also lists typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue", "My tongue feels like a hair on it", or "My tongue is tingling".
Parents of intersex children can choose gender undetermined
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly as male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare the sex of such children, but can indicate it on the birth certificate, either 'indefinitely' or 'not definitively'.
The aim of the law is to relieve pressure from parents to make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery for newborns and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC: "I'm neither man nor woman".
I'm the patchwork of doctors, mutilated and scarred.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 babies is born each year neither boy nor girl.
They are intersex, a group that is diagnosed with "sex-differentiation disorder" (DSD), a catch-all term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still poorly understood, but most experts in the United States recommend that the best available information on gender assignment be used if a determination is not possible and not wait for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding - if at all - to have surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing".
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children do not, he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the mystery of why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not gender-related but is determined by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were expressed in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and height, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination intersex and transgender people face in the workplace and the level of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who don't fit the gender profile are now in a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to state their gender on official documents.
In June, Norrie May-Welby (52) from Australia became the world's first 'genderless' person, after a court granted the lifelong maintenance of an 'undetermined' gender status.
German identity cards will have a third allocation, X for intersex, in addition to M and W, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition calling for the gender theory to be removed from schoolbooks.
The US website Catholic Online also spoke out against the German law, saying: If the world is being dragged into a new state where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.
The mother of a newborn in Maryland told Baby Zone that she preferred to have a gender assigned to babies at birth.
Parenting is stressful enough without any other restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your child, she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Only ten years ago, medicine viewed sex as something that could be eradicated and then rebuilt.
But now, the ethical basis of surgery is being questioned, now that we know how complex gender identity is, and that doctors may be wrong because they don't know how a child feels growing up with their assigned gender.
In the mid-20th century, this was called a 'psychiatric emergency', Drescher said.
When a child like that was born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with vague genitals dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held that sex is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental stimuli, such as how parents raise a child, interacted with a child's genes and hormones, and so shaped whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely, including his testicles, and then raise him as a girl.
Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, which it was not, Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male gender and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex surgeries came out publicly, "not happy with the outcome".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory" life as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
I knew I wasn't a girl, he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he was supposed to have a vaginal replacement.
But he was depressed and knew something was wrong, so he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with DSD, which made his body unable to produce enough testosterone to develop his genitals.
After learning the truth, he reverted to his male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project to make intersex people seen as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of California-based Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law could encourage "stamping and stigmatization".
Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a child to an 'unfinished' home, she explained.
We fear that this will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the gender male or female and then wait.
But we don't know yet what the law will do, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender".
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender, she explained.
The German law deals with the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight you should be forcing on little kids at this point.
When they're grown, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with gender dysphoria and who supports hundreds of others in a support group, says that German law "powers" both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz' daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect in the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now 29 years old and married, Katie is a child psychiatric fellow at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have a child by adoption or a surrogate.
The law gives parents room to make decisions without hurrying, said Baratz.
It gives them time to do different tests and to sort things out, and so gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
That way, everything is fine. You raise the child and love it.
You have a beautiful baby and you're enjoying the happiness of parenthood.
And you don't have to rush into surgery that you can't reverse.
This involves the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents have of not doing the right thing, she explained.
In the end, the child decides which sex is best for him, and that's wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknowns shoot girl from car
Unknown persons have injured a 12-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt in a drive-by shooting.
The perpetrators had allegedly fired an air-to-air gun at a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening.
The police in Burg have reported this.
The girl was slightly injured in the left thigh.
Paramedics took the girl to the hospital.
The gunshot came from a van that had passed a group of six children and stopped suddenly.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also fired at a bus stop.
A window broke.
Then they drove off.
The Criminal Police are investigating, they said on Friday.
By now, the police inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children who threw them against the facades of houses.
The owners of the house, who saw this early and immediately removed the eggs, were unlikely to cause any damage.
In addition, some New Year's Eve fireworks were set on the city area, but no property damage was caused.
A resident in Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his wheelchair blades were stolen.
By the time the police arrived, however, the man had found his Radzierblende in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to act further.
Housing with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries has a great place to live.
Her house is in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"You're not afraid of spiders, are you?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
She explains that the reason is not a fear of spiders but a fear of not being able to climb the many steps to the house and the apartment as you get older.
And since meniscus surgery, the woman in her mid-50s has had to experience firsthand what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently, she published a book entitled 'Happily Living in Old Age - What Is the Best Way to Live for Me?'
'Our apartment is the best example of what can't be done in old age,' she begins.
When she and her husband moved into the Maisonette more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the greenery.
Today, at the age of 50, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
She also knows that she is one of the few people who really care about the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most people push it away while they can.
'Only others grow old,' she says with a smile.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, do you think.
'But then it may be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 models of housing for self-determined living in old age.
'But the form of housing you choose is always a personal decision,' she explains.
There is no solution to age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider the possibility of becoming ill.
And: 'If you don't know the local language, you're lonely in Dolce Vita too,' the author of the book warns those who want to emigrate.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often-cited retirement home.
# Everybody gets their ticks and quirks #
'But I wouldn't want to live in a house like this,' she says with a wink.
Not like a student dormitory with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreat,' says Ries.
The author does not rule out the possibility of a senior housing community.
But that would have to be different than in the classic student lounge.
And sometimes you just want to be left alone,' she says.
It is not alone in this opinion, at least in the capital.
'Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartments as long as possible', is the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the citizens' service Life in the Age of the capital.
Your service advises people on the subject of 'growing older'.
This is why older people in particular would often accept inconveniences and limitations just to remain in their familiar environment, as the experience of the Warentest Foundation shows.
Today, there are many ways to make the home or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that anyone who is considering an age-appropriate remodel of their home or apartment do a thorough research and not hire the best craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists in age-appropriate remodeling.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be done, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But the existing apartment, even if it is beautiful, cannot always be altered to fit its age and thus be accessible.
This was the experience of Waltraud Ries.
Although a stair lift could be installed inside the apartment, the paved way to the door would be much more difficult.
She will keep searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
She's more afraid of moving than of the spider on her doorstep.
The United States wants to continue prosecuting Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude to former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of illegally passing on classified information.
He must therefore face criminal prosecution in the United States, said State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even the recent statements by Snowden would not change that.
Earlier, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to threaten him with further punishment.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which have not yet adopted the euro.
Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden is basically willing to talk to German authorities.
But first, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee wanted by the United States in an unaddressed letter that the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
The letter is worded as follows, according to a translation made by Ströbele:
To the competent authorities
I've been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was formerly employed as a technical expert by contract or direct employment with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government, which motivated me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of publishing these concerns, I found myself facing serious and persistent harassment that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political activities, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and even high officials - including the United States - have seen the revelations about a system of all-out surveillance that owes no one an answer as a public service.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and policies to address the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society of these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while the risks taken have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of trust and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Still, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this compromising attitude.
I hope that once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in a responsible manner and in accordance with the law in the investigation of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular as regards the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to speaking with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared up and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law, which protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands", says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Garden Street has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council at its most recent meeting in the private sector.
The building changed hands at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied", Maier stresses.
The budget was set at 100 000 euros.
It's not clear how the new owner will use the old kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to pay for the house's maintenance, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the walkway.
"That has gone away", Maier says.
The concert venue in high summer temperatures
The Hammereisenbach Music Association is giving a concert on the terrace of the Hammer Inn.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the bar at 7:30, the thermometer is still at 82 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammersmith musicians.
The chairman, Manuela Honeck, explains the pieces.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician's crotch.
Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported Thursday night that the president's top advisers had conducted "extensive panel meetings and polls in late 2011" to determine whether dropping Biden would make things better for Obama's waning re-election hopes.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for The Times, the book painstakingly traces the history of efforts by senior campaign and White House staffers, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge the effect on polling results of swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers  including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe  knew about the proposed change.
Double Down claims Daley led the effort to replace Biden despite their small personal relationship, before finally deciding against such a move after data showed that Clinton's candidacy would not significantly improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a lot of things to consider, and this was one of them", Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had terrible poll numbers back then, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley called the investigations "due diligence", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that considerable effort was put into the re-election campaign to find out if such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box.
Campaigns don't spend as much money on surveys and focus groups if you're not thinking seriously about something, Martin explained on AC360.
It's not clear, however, whether Obama knew his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe the president was "aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that Double Down does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
"Perhaps", said Martin.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually electronic mail.
Was the Internet e-mail service designed with a similar technical approach to traditional mail?
The design of the early Internet services was focused on making communication possible.
The basic technical protocols therefore failed to provide a solid basis for an audible exchange of letters.
So a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" emails "Benni", are the two computers directly connected?
Anna's e-mail program or browser first sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run through several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can call his provider and see what's in it.
Are traditional e-mails being read on their way through the web?
Most e-mails are read multiple times by software robots on the move.
The sender's provider usually checks that the e-mail contains a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the receiving systems.
The providers also check whether it is a nuisance and unwanted spam that is deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another job?
In systems like Gmail, the robot also collects the information that Google needs to place contextual ads.
When Anna and Benni communicate about their upcoming vacation via Gmail, Google can display relevant links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the e-mails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
But in theory, it is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the ability to read e-mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal options to intercept or take note of e-mails.
And then there's the potential for illegal espionage.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
An openPGP standard encryption can effectively encrypt an e-mail against reading.
It is also possible, with considerable technical effort, to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to easily identify who has been communicating with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the German e-mail market?
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established whether the measure is compatible with the internal market.
While Yahoo Mail's shares had fallen recently, Google's Gmail was able to gain significantly.
Mother hides in the woods and collects a pension
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg hatched a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest and continued to collect their pension and nursing allowance.
To continue to collect pension and nursing allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg resident buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
First he covered up the 89-year-old's death, then he took the money for over a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
According to the report, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May when it was discovered that the mother no longer needed medication.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
The officers were surprised and continued their investigation.
It turned out that the two had lived in the same apartment for more than 15 years and that he had last cared for her.
The 67-year-old finally admitted to his mother's death.
Police say an autopsy showed no evidence of capital murder.
You want some ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice that glows in the dark  using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and made a glowing treat out of them.
He got the idea after reading a paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to synthesize the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eaten, raising the pH of the protein and causing the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows -- so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says, "The product is amazing, but it's still in the very early stages of production, and you can get two grams of it for 200 pounds".
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and we thought it would be ideal to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to create an invisible ice cream".
This is impossible in itself because of the refraction of light produced by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish that Chinese scientists have created artificially
TSV Morsum are still without any points in the Handball Association League after six days of play.
Now, the team of Ingo Ehlers will go to the Derby tomorrow against TSV Daverden, which celebrated its first victory last weekend.
This game is a fresh start for us.
"I hope we can finally clear our heads", Ehler's attitude is optimistic.
He finally has his entire squad at his disposal, with the exception of Hendrik Blohme, who is permanently injured.
Daverden is as much about the tempo as we are.
So we have to keep our error rate low.
The first thing to do is to increase coverage, which has not been very secure.
Daverden coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was a house trick, of course.
But that doesn't make us the favourites, because anything can happen in the Derby.
Panitz is now planning to take a break in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing from the meeting.
The A-Jugendliche Joost Windßuß, who plays for the A-Jugend-Bundesligas HC Bremen, will make his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, you should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical about it.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and dress for the neighborhood.
I'm more of a Halloween muffin today.
For the past two years, I have not agreed to give out candy from my apartment, and I probably won't this year either.
But statistics say I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trendy values.
Costumes will make up about $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, irritating inanimate objects are the latest fad.
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes, but can now also emulate seductive foods like pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I'm expecting a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Space Men will make it to Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and to my amazement, we weren't alone.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
We're not picky about candy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million pounds of candy bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, walk around the neighborhoods saying "sweet or sour".
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million pounds of chocolate for Halloween and we're not going to worry about eating.
The only thing we don't want to eat is the sugary candy corn, yet 15 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more Halloween than haunted houses.
They have great names like Terror Behind the Walls, Howl-O-Scream and The House of Shock.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those gorgeous photos of you peeing in your pants and then posting your friends on Facebook where you can't get rid of them, and then the guy you're into leaves a comment like "nice face".
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree -- something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately, the pumpkin baby trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern that is slowly rotting in the front yard is believed to be from Illinois, where some 240 million pounds of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and carve something pretty out of their 2,000-pound pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers find charred body
The fire brigade had to leave Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the county courthouse catches fire on Friday night.
Rescue workers are retrieving a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers found a charred body in a three-family house in Helmbrechts.
It is not yet clear whether the victim is a resident, a spokesman for the Bayreuth police said.
Late Thursday night, there was a fire on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames were already starting to burn out of a window.
The paramedics went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not home at the time of the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is not habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor's profession.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hannover expects that the number of its currently about 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) told the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to control your own work and daily routine.
With Burfien, the local church has commissioned a full-time pastor to encourage young people to study theology.
Today, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after high school.
Burfien traces this to the process of excommunication: "God's voice is silent, the world is noisy".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
I'm the master of my schedule and I can focus on what's important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as ministers.
They earned as much as teachers and could live off it.
The free economy certainly pays more, but theologians would have a secure employer.
This is the way of today's young people, who are not only interested in a career but also in meaningful work.
According to the Landkirche, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theological school begin their vicarship.
In the future, it may be difficult to fill positions in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, Emsland and Wendland.
Among other things, Burfien plans to organize study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology to attend.
Theology is a broad-based study.
You can even become president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as a free-speech system.
Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.
They're not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure and an accessible route to world-class events.
We are delighted to be opening this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe the format will open up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the rigors and reality of rally raiding.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge car, which is going to be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge features a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called to rescue a puppy trapped 50 feet [15 m] above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Ruby , a cocker spaniel , ran away after a minor traffic accident .
Three days later, she was discovered in a quarry by a stranger in a bad condition.
Firefighters rammed off a cliff and saved the dog from certain death
The fire department managed to rescue a puppy that was stuck on a 50-foot-high ledge in a rock face.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby ran away from a car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to greet Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately searching for their missing dog and posted distress calls on social media when she ran into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a stranger walking his dog saw the ruby stranded on the 50-foot-high ledge in the quarry.
The technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and dismounted to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous position.
It was in the middle of the rock face, 50 feet from the top and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue. She was frozen solid.
But she's fine now.
She ate some dog cakes afterwards.
That was a pretty unusual assignment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge accident".
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was scary to watch the rescue.
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her again.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and she had collapsed, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and each one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she was going to fall, but she stayed up".
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger claims he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she was a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said she had dinner with the old man and that he picked on me when I was 18.
She added: "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind to me".
In a statement, a representative for Jagger, 70, said Thursday that he "categorically denies ever having made any attempts to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else".
Perry was one of the singers who guested on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album Prism landed at number one this week.
George Kerevan: European unity gives the Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story for independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
That provides the key to stories of passport controls at Berwick and a barbed-wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not make the headlines as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often bend their strict rules when it is more favourable for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what is really wanted from the Scots.
So, not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it's already like a fossil: I first heard the phrase "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
But an interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance to the European tune?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
The real European news is this: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has come to a standstill.
The euro crisis has officially put an end to the European project.
Throughout the EU, parties that are anti-EU or want to throw the euro as the common currency overboard are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party  founded just this year  won almost five million votes in the September Bundestag elections, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the British equivalent of the Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis is proving to be a turning point.
The strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which the national economies are forced by the adherence to the single currency, have led many to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive budget deficits  this was the case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pegged its members to exchange rates that are advantageous to German exporters  and German politicians would like to leave that to chance.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe will find itself at a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending, spurred on by Berlin.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are caused by a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the green energy directives a code of subsidies for French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers  issued by Brussels, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage fixing in the world does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to raise Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, with which the stricken French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote  a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split on the right would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the white French working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections , and this is very possible , then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will converge to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather become something like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stand on all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
We can also defend our own economic interests, which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what to do and where to do it.
I suspect Scotland could do quite well in a looser European union if we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise we should consider doing the same as Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is  remarkably  the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts, which were attributed to Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now to become independent, only to be forced to pursue austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty - Growing Up Faster
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes do not immediately mark puberty
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe the epidemic of obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is growing breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and are the new norm.
I spend a lot of time reassuring parents  usually this is not a sign that puberty is fast approaching, explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, are seen earlier in girls.
However, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the onset of the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
Once breast development begins, menopause takes at least two to three years to occur, said Kaplowitz, who also authored the book Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing With This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
There is controversy about what actually marks the beginning of puberty, but "early puberty" is when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
If progress is faster, tests by an endocrinologist may be appropriate to rule out serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and to prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to stunted growth and thus low body growth in adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but he admits:  Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls' feelings of being different from their peers.
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have their period.
They worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygiene side, said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock", recalls a woman whose daughter got her period at ten.
Even though there were early signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home from school scared and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of premature puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causative.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported the 2001 study of girls aged six to nine years, which linked body fat to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and young children.
"We need to be careful about identifying the true onset of puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician about how to speak to their child.
This may mean having to start a conversation sooner than expected, advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens sooner than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers are fighting over seating width in the face of large orders
A dispute over the width of seats in the passenger class on long-haul flights has erupted among leading aircraft manufacturers, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month's Dubai Airshow.
The dispute is about the width of seats offered to passengers in long-haul economy class - not always the ones that airlines are most concerned about, but this designated space is key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 18 inches in the economy class, but U.S. rival Boeing says that's for airlines to decide.
The debate comes as aircraft manufacturers compete to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from November 17-21.
The design of the rear of the aircraft  and in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats  is decisive for the reported economic results of the new mini jumbo design.
Boeing claims its upgraded 777X can seat 406 people in passenger seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing for 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide passenger seats, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often give out technical details by advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war, showing funders a picture of three people squatting in a restaurant with the caption: "Would you accept this?"
Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops, says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
People are getting fatter as a result of changing dietary habits, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data.
The waist circumference of the average American male in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a 1950s seat concept, when the average body size of the newly christened Jet Set was narrower.
Research has shown that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent, says Airbus.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat sizes and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fares and facilities.
The company also explains that research shows that the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It really comes down to giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to do to be successful", says Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is about more freedom of movement, but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
The debate is being driven by a race for aircraft orders estimated to be worth at least US$700 billion at list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or European export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on comparing the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original nine-seat design in the 777.
The increased unit costs are still lower than those of the current machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products", says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s suggested that many passengers opted for the tighter layout, which could come with cheaper fares.
"Eighteen-inch seat widths would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777", says Mary Kirby, cabin expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
The jet salesmen who travel the world even carry tape measure to match the equipment of the competition.
Even when they promote comfort, all manufacturers also offer highly compacted jets for low-cost and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the importance of more adaptability in the cabins and offered wide aisle seats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the reputation for a new industry standard will likely fade, but could distract from the 777X sales surge.
New nicotine vaccine could wipe out the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from lifelong nicotine addiction.
More trials are needed, which may take several years, before they can be tested in humans, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good.
We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have found that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches, says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information to make nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
In contrast, mice without vaccines would have taken a "break", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is absolutely safe, could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use it to quit.
They know that when they start smoking again, the nicotine vaccine makes them not feel pleasure, and this helps them to quit the habit, he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they also warned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister denies that he changed the maritime leasing regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had covert interests in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various ministers to renew leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids ran two restaurants and a cafe, without a tender after they expired in August 2005.
Now, the investigation is on the charge that Tripodi knew about Obeid's covert interest in the property after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole testified Thursday.
In years of negotiations, beginning in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the businesses at Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had initially been in favour of public tenders.
However, he denied that the changes were made at the request of Obeid, who, Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a change in the government's rental regulations.
A phone record provided to ICAC showed conversations between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had joined the Port Authority after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority, in August and September 2007.
Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing arrangements? asked Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No", replied Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes strike target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was a Russian SA-125 missile.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries to Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to authenticity tests
The government is considering a "authenticity test" for foreign workers on 457 visas as part of expanded measures.
If the test is introduced, it would be used on a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government debate proposal was released today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments about foreign workers as offensive to Australia's neighbours.
Loud declarations such as 'foreigners should be in the back row' and 'Australians first' are a very unpleasant setback in times when unions have been calling for a protected labour market, she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected and I wouldn't be surprised if some in the region heard an echo of this historic artifact.
The debate proposal outlines 12 measures once proposed by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
The Commission has already made a number of recommendations on the subject of the introduction of a new system of customs duties.
If the authenticity criterion is adopted, then a person applying for a visa could be checked for the authenticity of the application in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting enterprise.
Companies could also be required to report on the number of 457 visa holders, after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds in the past.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of what is believed to be a heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The troubled nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to establish high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England as early as 2026, starting with phase 1.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to be working with the UK government on this plan.
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Once phase 2 is completed, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed railway between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look into further route capacity and travel time improvements for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.
We're moving forward with HS2 because it's bringing enormous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved by HS2.
The Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, commented: Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to 'unambiguously' advocate for the integration of Scotland into the HS2 network.
Brown said: 'High-speed rail has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic strength provides an argument for high-speed rail links across the UK.'
We are therefore pleased to be working as a partner with the UK Government to explore options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will create benefits for all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to discussing the report with the British ministers next year and to deciding together on the next steps.
Provisional provisions on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones when taking off and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their regulations so that passengers can read e-books, watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in Flight Mode.
Passengers are already allowed to do so for most of the flight, but many people are upset that they are not allowed to read their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian companies are watching the decision, which will require a lot of work from US airlines, but have no immediate plans to change their rules.
The CASA also stated that it would consider the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia remain.
CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on board aircraft, it was reported.
The issue is subject to regulations requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already been in discussions with CASA about expanding the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, and said it is open to changes, but these would need to be initiated by the legislature.
We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, as we believe this would improve the customer experience, as we now offer (wireless entertainment) in-flight, a spokesperson said.
Qantas stated that it would remain in compliance with the current regulations until further notice.
Our current guidelines state that electronic devices must not be used during takeoff and landing, and we currently have no plans to change this, the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects on American societies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programmes and customer instructions.
Once an airline has confirmed its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any altitude, the FAA announced.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in compartments above the seat during takeoff and landing.
Before the derby against Schalke, BVB fans had arranged for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before Friday's Bundesliga game against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that offered itself to the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German runners-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart at Signal Iduna Park.
The guest fans were heard singing.
The southern stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, was initially exceptionally quiet: no chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the Capo, who normally coordinates the joint campaign, remained unoccupied.
And in the front of the stands, a large banner was waving lonely, with the words "Section of Stadium Prohibition".
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, entered the field as the first BVB player, did short-term cheers flare up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and scarf-waving - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south stand, nothing moved.
Norbert Dickel, the stadium's spokesman, also mentioned the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, the extension of coach Jürgen Klopp's contract - but it did not create a celebratory mood.
Only five minutes before the whistle, the chief climbed up his podium - and the tension that had hitherto been almost palpable was released in a loud cry as Dickel, as usual, inquired about the mood in the stands.
Last, as always, was the South Stand - and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when the south stand whistled and the loud call came, "Derby winner, stand up", everything was back to normal.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before the reviewer's derby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB fans had fired lightning missiles into the stands and onto the field - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was called off late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the Dortmund Ultras' top brass in his office afterwards - and if Watzke's words are to be believed, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement", the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from choreographing for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade it", he explained.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
The Ultras were also shown various options for punishment - they now have until Tuesday to decide on one.
Otherwise, Watzke said, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is going to be a big deal", Watzke assured me.
We can only hope that the reaction on the South Stand will be positive.
Singapore's pawn shops boom as middle-class crisis hits
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, ring and a pair of earrings at a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemeer shopping mall to pay for her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, and all my money is in it", says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 a month as an administrative assistant and her husband works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is rising  is so great that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, became the third pawn shop to list on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewelry mortgages are not only a quick way to get money  1,300 Singapore dollars in Janani Amirthalinga's case , but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Singapore pawnshops charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent charged by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, the advantage of the depository is that no credit check or proof of income is required, which makes loans faster than with banks.
This is why millions of people in the region turn to pawnshops, as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to lax fiscal policies in developed economies, lower and middle-income families are looking to mortgage companies to make up the difference in a stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's identified rising household debt, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore are estimated by the Agency to have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to GDP.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
Ultimately, this means that, given rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible, says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have fueled the trend toward mortgaging personal items as people seize the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items pledged in the city-state's 200 pawn shops are gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and bring it back next month".
Thailand's largest pawnbroker, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in its branch customers in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates the Bendemeer branch and 15 other branches in Singapore, is looking to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia  where it has four branches  but also outside Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it raised this week in its Singapore IPO.
While some lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only offer lower interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
Customers borrow items they already own, and liquidating personal valuables does not increase household education, she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted as a short-term, secured financing.
Nor are all people who take out a mortgage in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax stores to mortgage gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We have clients from all walks of life.
These include wealthy people who borrow for a business or investment on a short-term basis, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks, says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money real quick.
NSA is sucking up data from Google and Yahoo.
Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden has a vested interest in helping Germany solve the NSA spy case.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a Green member of the Bundestag, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify before a German prosecutor's office or an investigative committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine Panorama.
Rescue package of A$325 million for Tasmanian health
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions attached to the A$325 million bailout package for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth would "take immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by the island nation's ageing population, higher rates of chronic disease and systemic limitations.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after consultation with the Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency relief package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state", Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency assistance for election benefits.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopedic procedures and treatments for cataracts, are to remove residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved post-hospital care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals.
These investments are in line with the ideas that I have been told by clinical staff concerned are the best way to improve Tasmania's health system, said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain its current funding level to receive funds from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission is set up to ensure that the federal government provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use unless accompanied by real reforms that put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable course.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public healthcare system from the list of concerns, Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these election gains will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the opposition's health spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement is just a "patchwork solution".
"We are in this situation because the Labor government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system", he told ABC TV.
It's not possible for a state government to rip almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth to put 300 million in and then pretend it's good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the bailout was spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel is a convincing production with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also more expensive than necessary.
Set in 1760s France, the story follows the heartwarming story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another's erotic fascination.
The film never slips into lust or sensationalism and that's its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a torturous penitential shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, says a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons production facilities and leaded gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as heavy clashes erupted in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the deadline for the
The Commission has already taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented in a timely manner.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll in Syria through a network of activists, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 to pro-government fighters and 187 to Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
The report also said that 2,202 army deserters and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners, were among the dead.
On July 25, the UN estimated the death toll in the conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but gave no details.
The fighting highlights the danger that chemical weapons inspectors face, as their mission to rid Syria of its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said the team was now convinced that it had seen and witnessed the destruction of all the major production and blending/filling facilities named by Syria.
Therefore, no further inspection activities are currently planned.
The inspectors had earlier this week announced that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites identified by Damascus.
The inspectorate said that due to security concerns, the visit to two facilities was not possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC said that the two sites had been abandoned, according to Syrian statements, and that the chemical weapons facilities there had been moved to other designated facilities that were inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira site was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors were not allowed to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
I take my hat off to the bravery and courage you all have shown in carrying out the most challenging mission this organisation has ever undertaken, said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the monitoring organisation, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting the Assad government and its security forces, many of whom are Alawites, a splinter group of Shiite Islam, in this civil war.
In view of further developments, the head of the monitoring group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a powerful explosion at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Anger over the verdict of Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the instigators, who was brought to court, as they believed Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly a decade as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
If he's paroled, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in connection with the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many more.
A guilty verdict was also handed down on a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had asked for life in prison, even though they could have asked for the death penalty for the man, who is known as the Demolition Man because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has brought painful memories to June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly a decade ago.
She said, struggling with tears, that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put on a firing squad", Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with the fact that I'm not gonna have any more grandchildren and I'm never gonna see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002, when a huge bomb exploded in a pickup truck parked outside the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and died three times while on life support.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah  Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra  who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago.
Seriously, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
Let him live. No, there's no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the hearing, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden with the goal of re-establishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in", Corteen said.
Until recently, he showed no remorse for the suffering he caused others.
The verdict came ahead of this year's tenth anniversary of the attack, which will be commemorated with commemorative events in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year", Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his ruling.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but not make mobile phone calls)
Airline passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, listen to music and watch movies from takeoff to land, but not to use cell phones, according to new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depended on the airline, FAA official Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and equipment fitting arrangements to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of wearable electronic devices in aircraft.
These airlines included Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we may soon approve the expanded use of electronic devices", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors of the aircraft are closed.
You can only start it again when the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When boarding the aircraft, passengers must turn it off and not start it again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices during takeoff, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Flight Attendant Association, welcomed the changes.
If the new rules are implemented safely  and we work closely with the airline on this , both sides will benefit, commented Glading.
We're really tired of having to feel like guardians on this subject.
However, internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data within three kilometres remained prohibited, the authority said.
Passengers are advised to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the online game similar to Scrabble that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was publicly forced to exit an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the tarmac.
And heavier devices like laptops still have to be stowed away because there's a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight remain prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic equipment during takeoff and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert on CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
Phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially interfere with navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that airborne transmission can also interfere with transmission towers, Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue recommended last month that the government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to relax restrictions on use.
Critics, such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, say there are no valid safety reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies have shown that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore turning off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966 after reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment by passenger-carried FM radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time, became known.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be immune to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years now when they reach altitude.
Airplanes equipped with Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radioactivity than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when you turn the pages.
But when you download or send data, the transmission rates are stronger.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the measure is compatible with the internal market.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the interference was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only sporadic reports of pilots reporting aircraft systems being disrupted by the devices, and most of them were very old.
The Committee recommended, however, that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off their instruments when instrument landing in poor visibility.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible adjustment for travelers who would be well-equipped today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety", said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued bird released by air rescue service from North Sea Bohrinsel
A bird that was found exhausted on a North Sea island after being flown ashore by aerial rescue services has been released back into the wild.
The water rattle was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was treated by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: 'This water-crested whale was probably a wintering migratory bird from northern Europe, held back by the strong winds over the North Sea.'
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the borehole.
He added: He could not continue flying, which is why we were contacted with a request for help.
When she was released, the water-crested was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite willing to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and defining what those who create wealth and jobs in Britain want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them what they thought of Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders, representing roughly the size, sectors and regions of UK businesses.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while the EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to encourage new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than stop the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's obscure institutions.
When asked for their views on certain regulatory issues  from antitrust to product legislation, a majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with companies saying that the costs of Brussels rules now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area.
Finally, and this is probably the most telling, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority want Britain to change course on the deal and to have a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This recognition, which is shared by companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a 'meaningful change' that will bring the brunt of the action back to the UK.
The question is very much about whether changing the agreement and improving conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% swing in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the UK's EU membership terms.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to significantly shift power back to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey results show, which means for businesses a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
Today's event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterparts, where most of the Russian gas for Europe is stored, is creating an increased risk on conventional routes, according to official reports.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were 'forever' eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work on the planned route in other secondary countries is to start by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, Germany is the real estate location.
The economic outlook is good and the financing opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic environment in the country in comparison with Europe.
This was highlighted by Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Jones Lang LaSalle's Europe, Middle East and Africa business, at the 9th Stock Exchange Newsletter Real Estate Day.
The volume of transactions shows how popular German commercial real estate is, says Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive return", said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff charged with sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two New South Wales (NSW) YMCA staff were charged with child sex offences before charges were brought against Caringbah nanny Jonathan Lord in 2011, the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse learned.
However, in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it had never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse within the organisation.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall athletic instructor was convicted in 1991 of abusing children in his care.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew about the first case but didn't know about the second.
It acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in its claim that 'there were external audits of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as a frontline child safety organisation'.
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it had received the second lowest rating out of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of that year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that management failed to "take care of me" when hiring Lord and failed to ensure that staff were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sexually abusing 12 boys during his two years of service to the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lords violations regarding child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, telling one of them that he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the child services manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the Lords' supervisor at the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and very unapproachable most of the time".
The manager said he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their supervisor.
Instead, he said, her friendship with Lord had impaired her judgment, which is why they didn't report him.
Hare stated that he had communicated to the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson the organisation had to draw from the Jonathan Lord incident was not about reporting by employees and the board agreed.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations came to light was made by the YMCA's chief of children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said this was to prevent contamination of evidence, but that was "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organisation when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Griffith University professor Stephen Smallbone, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there were serious problems in recruiting, checking, training, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair has said he would seize the chance to return as British Prime Minister but admits a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight, on the fifth anniversary of his retirement, the 59-year-old announced his views on a variety of domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as Middle East envoy to the Quartet of Peacekeepers.
Asked if he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard of London as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely to happen, so ... "
When the horse show experts swarmed into Cardiff to train the horse of the year, they knew that a fierce competition lay ahead.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee, smoothly clawed their way through the three rounds and won first prize , beating 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable pair, both of equal height, were praised for their appearance, demeanor and style at the annual competition, which is hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had his plate cap at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old candy through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in handling the pony, which far exceeded his age.
And Toffee got top marks for his performance and personality.
Fenton got a sweetie last March for his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team".
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left the field with the Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had entered a contest with toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over a decade.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered and applauded him".
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals. He loves horses, tractors, farms, and he has two chickens to take care of.
The way he's started, it won't be long before he's on the Horse of the Year show and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony".
Together, they make a great team.
The judges rated Fenton and Toffee on how well they performed in the ring.
They're looking for good cooperation between Pony and Führer and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes did their part, which really fit the occasion perfectly.
Chinese newspaper to be reformed after call
A Chinese newspaper that had called on its front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a sub-state company.
The new Express is now undergoing a 'comprehensive rectification', the regulator said.
The Correction Order was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
The investigation showed that the Chinese authorities had not provided any information on the alleged violations of the rules of origin.
The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly, the regulator said in a statement.
She said that it was decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his journalist's license".
In addition, the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant persons responsible at the New Express and to immediately review the management team of the New Express.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express reporting on alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and supported his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion and the entire news industry and its ability to win public trust", he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was after money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that it had failed to properly verify the reports.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with its own railroad between the US and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical train service, has now been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the tunnel, measuring about four feet [120 cm] by three feet [90 cm], as one of the most elaborate passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which zigzagged along a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
There are numerous hidden warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide truckloads of drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported through it unnoticed, authorities said.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized, court records show.
Three men, who were said to be working as drivers, were charged with possession and intent to sell marijuana and cocaine.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses a challenge to drug cartels in how to get their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a 2,000-foot-long railway tunnel that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still in love
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr are planning to go their separate ways.
However, in an interview Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about his divorce from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said that "sometimes life doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and he were still in love, the 36-year-old said.
"We will support and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
The lexicon says that veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but it differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream, or a hearty edamer, these are not on a vegan's menu.
Milk, cheese, eggs, meat and fish are all avoided, and the vegan also refuses all animal products.
What remains, you may wonder, but on closer inspection the vegan world is remarkably inventive.
"Bread spreads are very popular", explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which has a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor likes to visit the shop on Cathedral Street.
The New Zealander has been a vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
Then, around the turn of the century, I took the next step and I became a vegan.
"The reason for the conviction was not just the diet, but the choice of shoes", says Proctor, who prefers leather to leather.
He realized that other aspects of life could be done without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me", Proctor says, the vegan maxim, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of chasing burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, and enthusiasm grew.
"It's a double bonus", says Proctor today, "being vegan is not really a renunciation, it's not an asceticism, it's an enrichment".
And it is precisely these conditions that have made even the most well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a major factor in many people's quick quit, much like smoking", says Proctor.
And he adds, "Certain tastes are not to be attached to the animal".
Often the spices or the way the food is prepared are what make it taste good.
"But there are other ways to achieve the same effect", explains the vegan.
For example, at a barbecue Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms, and some vegan sausages.
He eats a balanced, varied diet that is sure to be hearty.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste good, but that's not just reduced to animal feed", said Proctor.
He was not suffering from any health problems, including eating disorders, another widely held belief.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take in any foreign cholesterol and I have a high vitamin level.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood counts are fine, I get checked often", says Proctor.
Many critics of vegansimus warn against a lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed feed rather than grazing on grass, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the refrigerator is high in vitamin B12", says Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility of taking the coenzyme in tablet form.
"My B12 levels are fine", he explains.
Proctor doesn't have to go far to get food.
After all, basic foods are everywhere, and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on the spot.
I only buy something special once in a while.
"Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive, but this is also the case with 'ordinary' finished products".
In any case, vegan dishes are far cheaper and less time-consuming to prepare than is generally believed.
"There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, and a few little tricks can get you good, if not partially better results", says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbonic acid instead of egg, Proctor was able to amaze his in-laws with his vegan cheesecake.
Family gatherings add a new flavor to the vegan.
It's got a dynamic, when you cook together, it's got a new meaning.
"The situations that can arise are as varied as the people themselves", says Proctor.
But of course, he was met with skepticism.
Don't you like my food?
"Should I feel bad about drinking milk?" - these are the kinds of questions that you have to be very careful about as a vegan.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society", Proctor doesn't want to live in an enclave.
And when you look closely, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegan-alien as you might think - and the vegan isn't as restricted in everyday life as you might think.
Fast food is allowed.
There's fries everywhere!
"Many donut shops offer falafel or a vegetarian yufka", says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he evades the pasta dishes, or he orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to adjust.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, it was much more difficult", the New Zealander can identify a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware".
"If enough demand comes in, they may be inclined to add to the menu", he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Mannheim barbecue or the Vogelfrei café.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, there's vegan food for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they're the exact opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others", notes Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make most of it impossible in the first place", says Proctor.
But buying vegan products can be a little difficult at first.
Especially when you realize that even peanuts can contain animal additives as colorants, you seem to quickly lose heart in the face of so many obstacles and pitfalls to following ethics.
Not only that, but Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book, Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives, which explains the many ingredients used in food and cleaning products.
"Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stand still or stumble", says Proctor.
Veganism, it's an important moral finger pointing to consciousness.
It may not be able to make you stop, but at least it can teach consumers to question their habits critically.
The Nasdaq OMX stock exchange keeps its customers breathing.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon, German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other 11 US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued to operate unimpeded.
The recent incident continues a series of smaller and larger failures at the exchange operator.
Just on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in one week alone.
First, the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent out a massive number of erroneous purchase orders to the options markets because of technical problems.
It took the stockbrokers almost a full day to go through the orders and delete them.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading was down for several hours due to a computer failure at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Last year, Facebook's IPO also caused a stir.
Nasdaq systems had not kept up with the tide of buy and sell orders, the SEC later found, and the company was fined a record $10 million.
Cyclist drives 63-year-old man to death
The accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was riding a woman's bicycle on the left sidewalk from the station to the marketplace on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., according to police.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped onto the sidewalk from a local restaurant, the cyclist could not brake in time, police said.
In the ensuing collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, fell further down, and suffered a six-inch [15 cm]-long wound to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police issue Assange with an extradition warrant
British police today handed an extradition warrant to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been handed a "request to surrender" to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not comply he would face arrest.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden on a sex offence charge after his options under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has sent a '40-year-old man a request to report to a police station at a time of our choosing', a spokesman said.
He's still in violation of his bail terms.
The embassy has not commented on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks.
Driver who was driving at 210 km/h and drinking hot drink between his legs fined £1,000
A driver was fined £1,000 for driving at up to 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on the A120 near Braintree on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In the Colchester County Court Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
He got seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a £100 victim surcharge.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally recalculated the CGT measure but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who in Budget 2012 imposed a 7% stamp duty on homes costing over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own homes as a company rather than as individuals.
The revenue from the residential property stamp duty in the counties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which was £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp duty on high-priced homes and the introduction of the associated anti-circumvention legislation, it is hard to argue that high-quality properties are undertaxed, despite the impact of the outdated community tax system".
But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London, or deter owners from selling, he added.
First-class housing  the top five to ten per cent of the housing market by price  in London's affluent south-west belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen to a record 11.8 per cent last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging 'domestic market', where the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city were up, according to a Savills survey.
Scientists have shed more light on the relationship between a dog's tail wagging and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wagged their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wagged their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can sense and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "It is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the human brain respond differently to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions".
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the lateral tail wagging of their own kind, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched these films of other dogs.
They measured the four-legged man's heart rate and analyzed his behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction and in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs movies with dogs, either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate other distractions, and we were able to control the tail movement more to the left or right".
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog wagging its tail to the right (from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail was leaning mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging), their heart rate would increase and they would look restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not deliberately communicate with one another by these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs learned from experience what movements to worry about and when not to.
He said, "If you have multiple encounters with other dogs and wagging your tail in one direction is more likely to be associated with friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you respond based on those experiences".
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their pets' emotions.
John Bradshaw, a dog behavior expert and visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Medicine, said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a satisfied dog.
Another study at the University of Victoria in Canada found that dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog if its tail wags to the left rather than the right, rather than becoming restless.
He said the differences could be because the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain hemispheres are used for different purposes, many of the details remain to be determined and dogs are no exception, says Bradshaw.
But since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won't take long to understand why the tail moves sometimes in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys are postponing their Glasgow show due to Alex Turner 's illness .
The rock band Arctic Monkeys have postponed a show in Glasgow after their lead singer fell ill with strep throat.
The Sheffield band was supposed to play at the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has now been postponed.
The band's announcement came after they had to postpone a previous gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and following medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1".
Alex Turner has been diagnosed with strep throat, which is why he can't perform.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, the show at the Hydro in Glasgow has been moved to 21 November.
All tickets for these shows are valid.
We apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience this may cause.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the second highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so Francis will be appointing the first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the election of the pope  which falls to a group of 120  cardinals with the right to vote.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all cardinals would be held before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the consistory, was held.
Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned, Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible for election will likely be down by February.
He explained that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of elective cardinals back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Council of Ministers has decided to hold a special meeting on the future of the European Union.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it was "very possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this position before.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be appointed cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises" so we don't know who he appoints.
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. for seatback repair
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a problem with the manual-adjustable seatback, the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Administration said Friday.
In some wagons, there may be a defect in the front seat back mechanism.
For this reason, they do not meet the Federal guidelines on vehicle safety for head restraints.
If approached from behind, the headrest may not protect the occupants properly, increasing the risk of injury, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website said.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
Deliveries of the GM trucks began in June and represent the most important model launch for the leading US automaker since its insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day Government Shutdown, which negatively affected car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, redesigned for the 2014 model year, rose 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks, which were the largest sales in the U.S.
GM stock went up 1.4 percent at the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
A cry of despair from an Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change was possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade policy doesn't excuse the Obamacare website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoir of the 2008 election campaign is a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book right now.
It's a book I thought would cheer me up and give me hope again during my bleak second year of medical school.
It's called "The Audacity to Win", and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient records at night and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could take your breath away.
The election was a landslide victory and news reporters paused to recall the historic significance of that hour.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 percent.
And then I close the book.
To switch back to the present is a vicious awakening, like being snatched from a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic times, because they seem like a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just not what I imagined.
I recognize the great and diverse things that Obama has accomplished, from passing the Affordable Care Act to health insurance to withdrawing troops from Iraq, ending the forced concealment of homosexuality in the military, and killing Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the partisan blockade tactic has derailed too many of the efforts that should have moved our nation forward: immigration reform, a public health insurance option, and closing Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my explanatory efforts.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows the wiretapping of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives or why whistleblowers who expose government misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, or why public funding and spending limits are bypassed during presidential elections.
It does not justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the most "aggressive... since the Nixon administration".
And most recently, it can't excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
I wonder if I should have known at 18 that government work could conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the MP position is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unresolved alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard about for so long.
But with Obama's approval ratings dropping below 45 percent this week, it's made it even harder to return to 2008 with this book.
It makes me long for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to take a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with campaign workers after the decision, he told his staff they needed to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic", he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris alone.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave.
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters get pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who is in a legal dispute over paying $6 million in carbon taxes, made the claim as he tried to clear questions about whether he was in a conflict.
Palmer's United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important in deciding whether to eliminate or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer argued that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
 He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets leave or not, Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax, with a 53-vote lead after the recount.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the vote counting process to speed it up.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the end of the voting period?
We need a better system, he said.
Why can't we have a system where you walk in, you enter the data into a computer, you vote right away, and then at 6:30 p.m. you have the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Nowadays, voting with pencils is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new role "very seriously".
Public office is about public service.
We seek no reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time, he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its currency department, two people familiar with the situation, further indicating that the global regulatory investigation into alleged currency manipulation is gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with authorities in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation into the Libor interbank transaction scandal.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigation into this matter is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people familiar with the situation said that RBS had passed on records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now reported to have been relieved of his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was laid off this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Usher's Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide  the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are currently investigating allegations that bankers have colluded in currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are combing through instant messages and emails from several years ago looking for instances of misconduct.
News of these investigations has upset traders in a sector that has been one of the most profitable investment bank trading units in recent years but has been under pressure this year as low currency volatility limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks means that you can influence the market with very low ticket prices.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader from its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and is cooperating with them.
We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained, Credit Suisse said.
The fence on the Bechtle property is painted
A group of citizens' initiatives, Swiss Meadows, have been beautifying the fence on the Bechtle plot on the promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and widened the footpath, a press release said.
The planned coverage of the crumbling house in the back of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, as the site is in danger of sliding.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed on the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
The BI action was preceded by a banner with the message "We are for it".
This did not, however, disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Their slogan on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
She was warning of the danger of even greater ruin on the Swiss prairie if the giant project were to fail one day.
In the course of the discussion with many passersby in front of the "construction site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the city will do better with the project, although many have the same questions about the size of the project presented as the BI.
But they're starting to resign because the city is holding back on those answers, according to BI.
As we have heard, the public statements of the mayor also have an impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the ban on the thermal bath if the population voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss Meadow.
Some appear to be frightened, while others see it as a "clumsy blackmail attempt" on the population, the BI press release said.
The BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the people who helped.
Rank-nick rebukes for Shiris: Mane is not a swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sporting director of the "bulls" by the referees.
"There is a dangerous trend now that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of swallow kings", he defended the two offensive-spin bowlers at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest occasion for Ranknik's criticism was Mane's yellow in a 3-0 win over Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese turned a supposed performance into a disaster - which was not, as the TV images showed.
"A gross mistake", said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam also contributed to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot decisively: "I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every single situation".
Schmidt himself says he had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was offended", the 46-year-old stressed.
But given the success of the run, Ranknick voted for a hymn.
"There are only two words for it: really good", he said.
There's not much to show for it.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
I'm gonna let this go on.
There will be no change of personnel during the winter transfer window.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player comes forward with a wish to leave the club", Rangnick explained.
The Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law.
It's a major victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the health care law closely tied to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By a vote of five to four, the justices ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's single mandate  to force U.S. citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty  under the state's tax authority by 2014 is constitutional.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and held that the Health Act's requirement that states either expand Medicaid eligibility requirements or otherwise eliminate all state Medicaid benefits was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law had been filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly opposed by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary.
Norway: Norwegian village illuminated by giant mirrors
With giant mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley.
Because of the low sunshine, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century-old dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" shouted Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers were setting up sun chairs, while others were putting on sunglasses for safety.
In the past, sun-starved people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen proposed to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
But this basic idea has been around since 1913.
After years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million crown (about 615 000 euros) project.
A similar structure has been providing winter sunshine for the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for some years.
Mail hardly ever comes in on Sundays anymore.
"Many citizens may not have noticed that the red dots for Sunday delivery are still on various mailboxes in the city centre and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the delivery on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place", the FDP reports.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only the post office at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld is emptied.
The question whether the Hofheim and Rosengarten are still empty on Sunday is not answered in the answer to the FDP's question.
The FDP's social and youth spokesman, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to catch up.
Sunday delivery is an important postal service, especially for appointment mail.
"This business is radically and unreasonably thinning out despite the price increase for letters in January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, leader of the Liberal Group and the Liberal City Association, supports his colleagues: "What bothers me is the fact that the hours of work are being changed or even cancelled".
The post office is miles away from the city.
"At least the mailboxes in the Neuschloß and Rosengarten districts have to be emptied again on Sundays", Bittner and Röhrenbeck say in unison.
The same applies to the city centre, where non-mobile citizens should be able to reach a mailbox with a Sunday delivery on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city council if the city administration planned to talk to the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
But he knows there's a Sunday school in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere", Maier said.
Frankfurter Parking Fees to Rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become significantly more expensive.
The city magistrate is considering a motion by transportation commissioner Stefan Majer (Green) this morning.
Accordingly, parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of vehicles in the Community by a further ECU 1 billion.
The city council must decide in December.
The retail trade committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the store was 'a major advantage for smaller retailers'.
The German Transport Club is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is 'quite appropriate and actually overdue'.
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast action surprises hosts
With a narrow squad, the Gentlemen I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturhalle in Reutlingen.
The Elbs were on the other side of the net with an experienced crew.
However, it soon became clear that, even due to their age, they could not keep up with the rapid actions of the Freudenstädter.
The hard and placed blows were extremely hard for the Gönninger.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks cleared by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz through the midfield and were not present at the blockade defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadt in all respects.
Given this overwhelming and decisive performance, the third set was then won somewhat lax and lazy to the score of 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, TV Baiersbronn, which has clearly won in Nagold, will face a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz. The following are the cast members of the first season of the German television series Freudenstadt:
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced off in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fiercely contested two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points to be awarded, and the passes were sometimes not accurate and in some critical scenes the overzealousness prevented the view of possible points.
In this performance-balanced match, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently showed great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Day care at the little Englishman's hut
On the fifth day of the upper Hotzenwald Natura 2000 project, a group of dedicated participants met at the small Englishman's hut in Ibach.
The town's mayor, Helmut Kaiser, said that the town's residents had asked for a clear view of the valley from the hut.
Many hikers described this area as the pinnacle of the gorge, where the landscape provides the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the participants for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to make an impact on nature itself.
The tourist aspect must be accompanied by ecological considerations.
This environmental aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Protection Department of the Government Office in Freiburg, following the welcome given by the Regional Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the project a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist objective of the long-term view is to preserve the old common pasture, which has now grown considerably, with its specific protected habitat types, by opening and connecting it to the existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome forest barriers.
They need these free-flowing connections for conservation.
Tribukait said she would not miss a chance to break a spear for the proposed biosphere reserve.
The current measure does not just fit seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere reserve also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of its internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to what has been achieved with the LIFE project and the care days so far for the future.
After these various presentations, the district manager Christoph Wehle and the Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been felled in advance, and the forest tractor was ready to be called up.
A group of helpers would be assigned to free up juniper bushes and maintain a dry stone bar.
The objective was to have a clear view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the small town of Baarstadten Löffingen, with its 7514 inhabitants, intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and senior citizens' policy and its own municipal authorities, can be described as an attractive city, no second candidate for mayor has yet come forward.
The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for mayor because of his age, is 46-year-old bankman and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The deadline for submission of applications is Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei are sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of Nortel's previous patents, on Thursday launched a spate of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it outbid in Nortel's bankruptcy bid.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is being accused of seven patent infringement cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that run Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, most recently to $4.4 billion.
After being outbid by Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patent claims in the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents, the complaint states.
Rockstar is seeking a large amount of damages from Google, as it alleges Google's patent infringement was intentional, the indictment says.
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi is sworn in, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who had been ousted 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the court, which sits on the Nile and is modeled after an ancient Egyptian temple.
We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life, absolute freedom, real democracy and stability", said Morsi, 60, a US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been heavily targeted by the government since its inception 84 years ago as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp of the Mubarak era, traffic was only temporarily halted to allow the convoy to cross the usually busy road that connects the city center to the southern suburbs.
Mocked as an uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a speech on Friday in which he presented himself as not only the candidate of the Islamists but of all those who wanted to complete the efforts of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state today", Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in the wooden-panelled chamber where he was sworn in.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University to give his commencement address.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem, which he listened to in a bearded position.
The military commander, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the largest lecture hall of the university with choruses of "The army and the people are one hand".
Cairo University, founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, became a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken from the ousted head of state.
But by taking the oath of office in court instead of the parliament as usual, he is bowing to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberg's discotheque is going to be a great two nights.
The new season at the Falkenberg disco "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday night is called "Pump this party". Tomorrow Saturday night, we're going to continue with a 25-minute party.
The organizers promise a lot of beats and cool sounds on both days.
Worker fell from ladder: seriously injured
While replacing a faulty external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a faulty heating sensor on the exterior facade of a guesthouse.
When he climbed the ladder that was leaning against the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He was seriously injured and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital by the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
South African rapist: Two life sentences
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC.
The victim later died from his injuries.
John of Cana had already been found guilty earlier in the week of the crime.
The act had caused national horror.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial estate in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, doctors fought to save the victim's life, but to no avail.
The sight of the youngsters was so horrific that the nurses and nurses needed psychological help.
Kana had admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar with Booysen the night of the murder.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for her death.
The police initially assumed that several perpetrators were involved, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the proceedings that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa, with some 64,000 reports of sexual violence per year.
This is almost ten times the number of people in Germany, which has 82 million but a much larger population than South Africa (50 million).
But police and women's organizations in South Africa estimate the darkest numbers of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": for the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear at the outset that the pigs' necks are the most important thing for ham, and turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham that you buy in any supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the workings of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo calls the Black Forest ham.
Only with a hair cover and a coat will he get inside the factory.
Jumbo has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the microphone.
Jumbo sighted in forest hut for fast bite reinforcement
"I'm getting a lot of work done here", the TV producers marvel, "Black Forest ham is a mass product".
16,000 clubs a week speaks for itself.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what is important in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV with a level?
Details such as the pH of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I wonder what happens when you measure Roberto Blanco", Jumbo said cynically.
This is a presentation of the level of private television in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that dismantling the clubs is still manual work.
Because Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones.
The secret of ham is the mixture of spices and salt.
The smoke tower and smoke firing make Jumbo look like a submarine.
The trick is that pine branches in the smoke give the black forest ham its distinctive flavor.
20 days in the smoke, the ham turns almost black.
"Now the glass in the jumbo is disappearing", he announces the test feed.
"It's really good", the TV star concluded.
It will be a living for all concerned.
You thought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has raised its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects a pre-tax adjusted annual profit of between $325 million and $340 million, up from $305 million to $315 million in its earlier forecast.
If current targets are met, this represents growth of 12 to 17 percent compared with the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As announced by Managing Director Graham Turner, Flight Centre posted an eight per cent profit in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half, particularly in the Australian and UK private sector.
Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on track to record annual earnings before interest and taxes, he explained.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest performers.
In Australia, the leisure sector recovered in the second half of the year, which offset a slightly weaker business travel market.
The leisure business of Flight Centre in the United Kingdom did similarly well, while business customers here also spent less.
US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, with a profit for the full year expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Center's stock went up 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are being urged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In future, English literature courses will require students to cover at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes unread texts to encourage wider reading.
The combined course in English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE language test, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the examinations regulator, will announce a reorganisation of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence", stressing that GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math -- 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year -- than most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and Singaporean students receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for maths in the curriculum, coalition circles say that the comprehensive maths test  combined with a greater weighting of the subject in the rankings  will probably encourage schools to add more hours.
The curriculum places more emphasis on real-life problems, including financial mathematics.
♪ Lure beautiful animals and delicious cakes ♪
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours are presented at the county association performance show this weekend at the town hall.
The evaluations were made as early as Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 is organizing this major exhibition.
Breeders from the clubs in the Soest region show their best animals here, as well as young Wickeder hobbyists who have their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges evaluated the many rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by the Mayor of the city, Hermann Arndt, on Saturday at 14.30.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a raffle with lavish prizes and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson is parting ways with her legendary blonde curls and performing for the first time with a new baby face.
Pamela's blonde curls are famous from her role in the TV series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to shock her fans with a drastic new haircut.

The next Ecumenical Dialogue Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle will be on the topic "On Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical churches of Salem, the Castle of Salem and the Cultural Office of the Lake District.
Johanna Rahner wants to explore the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If in past centuries people were too well informed and relied on the images of heaven and hell "that still shape our ideas today", the modern prophetic teaching of hopes of fulfillment is more characterized by a degree of embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"Christians have been duly displaced from greater hope by criticism of religion", says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks".
Johanna Rahner adds: "But the ultimate challenge remains the annoyance of death".
The question of the desire "to have everything go well in the end" is also involved.
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-University in Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She obtained her doctorate in 1997 in theology, also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms-University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been a professor of systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Hostages: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleinen Heuberg reaffirm their faith at the confirmation
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths from the Nursery Unit in the Little Heap were arrested.
The morning service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group, and the afternoon by the Youth Choir The Spirit.
Upon receiving the sacrament of confirmation, the young ones said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
The Firmlings had been preparing for the great feast in the past months, under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners.
In different projects they learned about different tasks of Christian community life and experienced the youth day together in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: second mountain bike race enthuses participants
In fine weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to cycle the circuit over the hill chains surrounding the lake.
This is reported by Ulrich Knobel from the sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially in the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers from the German top class were also at the start of this race: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two could have set off from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader managed to save a small time-break to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
In second place, Pascal Treubel was again able to place himself.
In the women's event, it was Theresa Duelli of Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the podium.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driber from Owingen.
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, but the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from 10 years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest.
In the main race, even more absolute top athletes were starting this year.
Four drivers were able to displace the regional leaders.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a semi-pro mountain bike racer for the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate were two-time world champions in the 12-hour race.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already claimed two German titles in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres, the final was a blink of an eye in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Only a second behind, the routineer Ballerstedt secured second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall standings.
In the women's category, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized running of the event.
Traveling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one for every 5,000 people
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for him to be CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ailing father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that lacked the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then inflammation spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, says Georges Bwelle.
We would have gotten him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
It is not easy, comments Bwelle.
You can leave your house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has changed little since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, in the United States the ratio is one doctor for every 413 people.
But even if a doctor were available, most Cameroonians would not be able to afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
The only problem they have is poverty, says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others force themselves into minibuses and ride over unpaved terrain with the medical equipment strapped to the roof to the villages in need.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be greeted like heroes with feasting, singing and dancing and the best accommodations the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration and Bwelle  with his broad smile and boundless energy  is happy to join the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins examining hundreds of patients.
We treat 500 people per trip, says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village  and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates - a document needed for school but simply not affordable for many poor families.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries are usually performed in a school, town hall, or apartment, and after the procedure, patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next patient.
The group's generator powers the lighting for the operating room and the disinfecting equipment, and Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a tiring job, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work, says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team drives back to town, tired but proud of the work they've done.
The group  a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students  performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free surgery he received for a herniated disc enabled him to return to work.
"This changes the future of my family", the man said.
In addition to his weekend clinics and his work as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
This second job finances 60% of his charity work, Bwelle says, with the rest coming from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping", says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteers with the Bwelles group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe to support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never have at home.
We can be on hand for surgeries, helping to draw blood or holding instruments for Dr Bwelle, explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their own trips to Cameroon and often bring donated medical supplies.
But once in Yaoundé, Bwelle provides accommodation, transportation, and guidance.
"He is a hero without a doubt", says O'Malley.
He has dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is no burden.
He finds great joy in helping others to live a happier life, thus fulfilling a promise he made to his Father.
I'm so happy when I do this job, says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.
Please visit the ASCOVIME website to find out how you can help.
Excellent in the Fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is a Horst Janson cut to the chase.
Janson is an old hand in his profession, acting.
You can't fool old Santiago at fishing.
It's just that they complement each other so perfectly.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles on the old man's neck that the fisherman boy Manolo talks about.
When Santiago is bent over in a chair, tired of life, it's real with Janson.
The role of the old fisherman is a character role that Janson is perfectly capable of playing.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who never gives up and ultimately, through his knowledge and also his willpower, wins the fight against the fish.
Janson is by far the only actor on the stage.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is just blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann has the old man act in the boat outside the fishing village.
During the performance, he highlights the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the Cuban spirit with her songs and her glorious voice.
The four musicians play Cuban rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: The descent into the Romans
A Roman-era sewerage canal is about 120 meters long below Cologne.
Anyone who visits Cologne can't miss the cathedral.
At about 500 feet [157 m], the two towers reach the sky, making it the second-tallest church building in Europe.
Yet few visitors who marvel at the two delicate church spires suspect that there is much to discover beneath the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for his tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts off in a very unspectacular way: "We start in the underground garage", says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a city that was car-friendly, and so only what was not too big remained of the remains of the old city wall.
Most users of the parking lot today therefore also rush past the Roman remains and just park their car.
But a closer look reveals an archaeological site on Deck D2, separated by metal bars.
You can see about 15 feet [5 m] high ruins of hand-sized stones.
"They are the remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century AD", Schulze says.
Before returning to the light of day, Schulze takes the participants to the top level of the parking lot to take a look at a dark, 50-foot-deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop on the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend back into the depths.
We are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for 'Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium,' which in good German means 'City of Roman Law and City of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius on the site of the altar to the cult of the emperor.'"
And the Praetorium is the former Governor's Palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition hall, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewerage system, which is about 120 meters long.
"You can walk along the Cloaca Maxima if you want", Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze has a surprise for you.
After taking the key from the register, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath", he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground to access the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, has different water levels as a result of the changing level of the Rhine.
The mikveh will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, which is expected to begin construction soon.
But it will be years before it is completed.
Leg almost chopped off: Re-issue of Rocker trial
A bloody attack in the rocker community is re-roled up after more than four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily harm and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the district court in Frankfurt (Oder).
He's being escorted by strict security measures.
The defendants are silent at the opening.
They say you were active in the rock scene and were part of the bandidos at the time.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car in Finowfurt in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims were said to be from a rival group, the Hells Angels.
One of them was a high-ranking member of the Berlin police.
Apparently, a chase with several cars had preceded.
The prosecution said it was a territorial dispute and a show of force.
The two accused were acquitted in a preliminary trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators were wearing masks and had not been identified.
The Federal Court of Justice, after reviewing the decision of the public prosecutor's office, annulled the judgment and referred it back to the Regional Court for a new hearing.
One of the defendants is currently in open custody for another offense.
The first step was to reconstruct the events of the night of the crime.
The then Commissioner for the Investigation was called as a witness.
The center contained cell phone records of the accused and others who had been tapped by the police.
The difficulty is that rockers in court almost always follow a law that is unique to them - and do not testify.
The same goes for the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Prosecutor's Office said on request that new evidence had emerged since the last trial.
The trial is scheduled for 11 more days.
The disposable society doesn't think
It's been a long night, the music's loud and the mood's good, but eventually you go home.
Only, the stomachs of the people in the front and back seat are showing hunger.
Of course, it may be some cocktail or a drink!
What's closer than driving cold to the next drive-in to get a treat?
I admit, I like to be there when it's late at night or early in the morning to pick up fast food.
A couple of fries, a Coke, a burger, and then nothing like home and bed.
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers became apparent.
What's wrong with throwing your fast food out the window all the time?
Especially on weekends, paper bags are found on the side of streets and in parking lots.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next dumpster?
It's not just the paperwork that's changing the landscape.
Bags have also covered transportation facilities, such as traffic lights, and have caused accidents.
But what this "throw-away society" thinks about is not, probably, what it actually means.
If you are traveling more often at night, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after a night of partying: clothing, bottles, and other garbage piles up.
A few more bags or less would not matter - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on other people's leftovers.
I can see the day coming when cities and towns will be too stupid to make room - and fast food chains will have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama's retreat from health policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it".
After hundreds of thousands of people received letters of resignation from their insurance companies, Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama put his original promise into perspective.
The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it, he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the layoffs, Obama urged those Americans who received such messages to look to the free market for new insurance.
This would enable most citizens to obtain better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or at a lower cost than projected.
"They're coming up with a better offer", he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the population who had their own insurance would have to look for another plan because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say to these Americans, quite directly, you deserve better", Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as anyone else", she said.
I'm determined to win back your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to a counselor sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing was recorded after a debate with Republican Congressman Billy Long of Missouri over whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily forgo a government-sponsored insurance policy to sign a HealthCare.gov plan herself, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
The government in Jerusalem confirms attack on Syrian air base not
An American government official, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Syria's Latakia a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared was destined for Lebanese Hezbollah, CNN reported.
Syrian and Lebanese media and the Arabic channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shelled on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, blaming Israel for the attack.
Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Newa anti-ship missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 said have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters news agency quoted an Israeli government official who also declined to be named as saying that he believed Israel carried out the attack but was not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai wrote in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime has tried to deliver surface-to-air missiles to Hezbollah before, with some success.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be crossing a "red line" followed by a military response.
John Kerry says in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has "gone inappropriately far".
John Kerry made an unexpected admission, suggesting a softening of the US defensive stance on its surveillance programmes, saying that in some cases the spying had "gone inappropriately far".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he shared responsibility with Barack Obama for switching to "Autopilot" when whistleblower Edward Snowden's explosive revelations about NSA spying became public.
The leaked information has plunged the U.S. government into a diplomatic storm of outrage from its allies.
In a video-conference speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no question that the president and I and others in the government have learned some things that have been on virtual autopilot simply because of the ability to do so, which goes back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course to 9/11.
He was then the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately.'
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this trial.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: 'We are facing a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.'
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up things and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have been informed of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US on counterterrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament representatives and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of frustration with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
It is very important to the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board in our joint efforts to combat terrorism, Murphy, a Democrat first-term senator and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations and European Affairs subcommittee, said in an interview in Washington.
I'm also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has intercepted millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents provided by Snowden that the NSA had monitored the cell phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the National Intelligence Service, James Clapper, defended espionage on allies as necessary and stated that it was common on both sides.
In the midst of all the commotion, Murphy said his agency is preparing for the trip to Congress this year and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and the House.
The names of the other Members of Parliament will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also spoke of some serious words.
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they themselves have been running for years.
While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying, Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is due to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the anger over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and US surveillance activities.

Australian woman appeals jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of making a false statement by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
Later, however, video footage showed that she had made it safely to her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
She was in police custody until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian rugby league player who has turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's wellbeing and wanted her back in Australia.
We are of course very worried, but we hope she will be home as soon as possible, said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is free on bail of 50,000 baht.
Australian reports said she was vacationing in the southern Thai resort of Krabi.
The court heard Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may be trying to improve its battered tourist image after the recent murder of tourist Michelle Smith in Phuket, and that an acquittal is therefore forthcoming.
