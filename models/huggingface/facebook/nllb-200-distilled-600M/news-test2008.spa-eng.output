European inflation slipped in food
The accelerating inflation rate in the euro area is primarily due to the rapid growth in food prices.
The increase in prices in November was higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, the Luxembourg-based Statistical Office of the Union said.
Official forecasts were only about 3 percent likely - Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, UK and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut basic interest rates on the pretext that the decline, together with rising commodity prices and a reduction in forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to 2 percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "negotiate" inflation so that it does not have to intervene later on.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke a 12-year record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area soared as a result of the high food and energy prices.
Wheat overtime quotas increased by 88% and soybean prices also reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
Crude oil prices on the world market have risen this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from the current 2.1 percent in 2008 to 2.5 percent, but will decline to 1.9 percent by 2009.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent over the next three to four months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double interest rates during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long standstill, by early December support for the Alliance of Young Democrats had risen significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while Gallup had never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - for socialists.
The difference in the case of the party-safety voters - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two thirds (71 percent) versus support of a fifth for the Socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the limit necessary to have a parliamentary scan: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even from the previous low point - it has never been so high, with 41 percent of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 percent believing that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As for next year, the majority of the population is seeing a deterioration and only one tenth of the population expects an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, more than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of the Government was doing more badly than well.
Thirteen percent of those surveyed trust or have high confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those surveyed.
54 percent of the population has no confidence in the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the political situation is how much of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October unrest last year 35 percent felt it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, at present this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believe the only solution is holding new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the participation question answered that they would participate for sure and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
In comparison, in "a general election to be held on Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would participate safely and another 15 percent believe that participation is likely.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of paying tuition fees, 79 percent of the population would disapprove of paying for medical consultations and 84 percent of the population would disapprove of paying for hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, Tesco has five times its prices
The average increase in prices of 16 per cent was maintained by the hypermarkets in the Budaörs gold trading triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Written by Napi Gazdaság
This year, the regular Napi Christmas basket also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold trading triangle, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above HUF one thousand.
As prices in supermarkets had already 'scaled' in December last year, there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy for far below HUF 9 000 last year cannot be bought for 10 000 today.
Napi's basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF by a minimum of HUF 91.
And the highest value basket was HUF 10,573.
(in 2003 that basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum liqueur and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, nut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the figures of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread at the price of HUF 139.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of the two-litre redemptable bottle Coca-Cola was less than HUF 200, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, was only HUF 257.
However, in Napi's basket Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15%, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18%, the prices listed in Napi's basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket to this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was HUF 1480.
Last year the average price growth was HUF 1206, so that during Christmas last year the VAT increase was felt in prices.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, supermarkets were clearly unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product's circulation, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that adjusts to the sales volume.)
The price increase of Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the VAT increase, that the most expensive basket was HUF 1720 higher than the value recorded in 2006, while the cheapest basket was only HUF 844.
This year no such extremes occurred, since the highest price now was HUF 1630 more than last year and the cheapest price also increased by HUF 1284.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price growth in less than 20 months, with the prices of consumer goods in the supermarkets rising by more than 30 percent.
(This does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, for some basic foodstuffs, recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent over the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, in the case of the egg, too.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, since the price of this product, which was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, recorded, in the worst case, only a 10 per cent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers are stronger than egg suppliers, and can impose the drastic rise in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain about the gold triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
In our experience, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy large quantities of all products, carrying canned food with them.
On Wednesday morning, large queues were formed in front of the boxes in all three stores because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that domestic sales volumes are lower, and many multinationals complain to survey institutes that revenues are below their plans, not only for food but also for appliances.
In many hospitals, disinfectants save money.
This year, several thousand infections were reported in hospitals, primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overload of staff do not favour infection control - says the chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals, even disinfectants save money.
A recent MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
A man hospitalized after a serious accident was found to have antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The patient was isolated.
The same kind of infection occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
A serious car accident injured man was discharged from hospital and the same patient was soon sent back to the hospital due to MRSA infection and since then no major surgical intervention has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been recorded in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, chief of the department at the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that hospitals have certainly seen this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents, and there is no information on the rest.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, which is Staphylococcus aureus, which is methicillin-oxacilin resistant.
One third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by AS (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once over- or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become highly antibiotic resistant and quickly spread under inappropriate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example wound infections or septicemia primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened bodies, the elderly or people with low weight.
According to the doctor-director of János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are common in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - Tibor Nyulasi said - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff are taking care of them in rubber gloves and masks and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospital patients are screened in advance to check for MRSA in their body, but even this cannot prevent infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples.
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections with MRSA in most cases, but the current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA in their system.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the epidemiology center's chief medical officer.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for treating infections and pathological frameworks.
The aim of antibiotic therapy is to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
It saves with the disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from patient to patient through healthcare personnel.
Hand washing, rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in domestic hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with less favourable economic conditions disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a higher likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are taken, fewer such infections are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is being fought in every country.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The programme appears to be successful, and according to the data provided, MRSA infections are showing a decline in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has priorities for the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police chief who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the fatal accident caused by the district police commander of the XXII has been made.
The possibility that the then-resigned commander of the police of the XXII district was driving drunk or stunned can be excluded, who on Tuesday hit and killed a passerby - said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol control which had already established that the former police commander did not drink alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when folding to Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district hit a 55-year-old man, who was trying to cross the street, but not in the designated area for pedestrians.
(The latter fact, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and asked for retirement, according to the police statement, because he was deeply moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is being carried out by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said the former police commander had been collaborating with prosecutors in charge of the investigation from the beginning.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements totalling €400 million on Friday in Budapest to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, which will be financed from the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million. The contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective for Hungary, the decision on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be taken later, when extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for innovation of EUR 50 million, which the budget will mainly use for the University of Debrecen's innovation and research project.
The talks also covered the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary had finalized with the EU the details of the Metro's financing, they would re-examine whether or not to amend the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this could take place at the earliest in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is matched by EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, with no commission for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards the aforementioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buy on the even cheaper EU market, will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also attract interest from real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap Rus area.
The capital Sofia will also be attractive, with commercial and office spaces promising a rapid recovery in investment.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf destinations in Europe, and thus a prime destination for the other two seasons, as well as summer and winter.
Therefore, prudent investors are already shopping, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
Analysts say that those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in ski resorts.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle here buy new or renovated properties for between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, and the proximity to a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important to them.
The second category is for chalet buyers (Bulgaria was included in the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of gaining a medium or long term benefit.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, over the past five years they have increased by 21 per cent annually.
The increase in real estate prices far outstrips wage growth.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue the negotiations at the ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are deliberating on the Bali Roadmap on post-emission reduction efforts, set out in the Kyoto Protocol, until 2012.
The debate on this topic is currently going on in the developing countries and the industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not wish to negotiate precise figures at the moment, although it is keen to agree that compared with 1990, greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by 25 to 40 percent by 2020.
Another major topic of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to offer material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was also reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, likely within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac est Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gabor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 from 1990 levels, regardless of whether the "post-2012 agreement" is signed or not, and is willing to commit to reducing even 30% if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to commit to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that signed the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to a 5.2% reduction, of which the then 15 EU Member States committed to an 8% reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the period 1985-87, which Hungary will meet, the Ministry of the Environment said in a press release.
There is much at stake in Bali, as the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed in two years, because otherwise it is certain that its entry into force will be postponed until after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN's international scientific association on climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
The reduction of emissions would therefore be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C in the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, which, according to scientists, would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units on a video distributor release recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (BRAF) took advantage of YouTube's services first: special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are monitored at the Kandahar General Operations Corps, then sent to London for uploading to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded to the Internet and their "channel" has already been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the Ministry of Defence's view they also serve to present the public with the true purpose of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - but inevitably has some political message, since in a specific way they justify the purpose of government-decided military actions.
The Americans have a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, there are also amateur videos on the distributor, for example about the deaths of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, the officers talk as much about losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos of actual operations from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been uploaded to the Internet, but the British military is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form of recruitment with free-to-play shooter video games called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers.
Tomb and salted pastry at the Christmas party of the ministries
Labour Minister Monica Lamperth is not feeling too well: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who can say goodbye to 2007 with salted pasta and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how power is fun.
State offices are also getting ready for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for the Ministry's workers.
On the day of the Orphans' Christmas, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts and on the day of the Missionary Christmas, the relatives of soldiers currently serving overseas will be invited.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the holiday atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a lavish party with respect to the other portfolios' holidays
The MET party will be held at the Casa del Futuro, with a total budget of HUF 4 320 000 and the attendance of some 350 of the six hundred employees of the Ministry is expected.
At the wallet party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
The ANF Christmas cost HUF 4 700 000 and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with music concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost HUF one million, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We are informed that the workers of one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party which will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development with Community funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit.
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on December 7.
The CNAJ did not charge them anything for using their facilities.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began with the minister's greeting words and after dinner there was live dancing music.
In response to [origo's] question, they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a nightgown or nightgown.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organise a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
Labour Minister Monica Lamperth, on the other hand, is not expecting her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a weekend work meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected to attend, and the press department said they will only drink coffee and salted pasta, so the party will not cost more than HUF 350,000.
Minister for Local Governments Gordon Bajnai will instead simply have a toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of HUF 2500 per guest - of this budget the buffet reception and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
The official character will be given not only by the ministerial address but also by the afternoon time of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the one hundred guests.
The press department said that this will be a very simple standing reception, inviting only qualified diplomats accredited in Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a brief greeting from the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas celebrations - this is what the corresponding press departments have informed [origo].
The press department of the environment portfolio was unable to report on the budget for the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday, which will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while the final vote on the public health law will be held on Monday.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Public Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon the League Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday which they will hold together with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Union of Motorists will also be constituted to coordinate the actions on Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will go on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date on which the strike was to end.
If the National Assembly disapprove of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
If the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
The agenda of the National Assembly on Monday also suggests that the public health law may only be voted on in the late hours of the night, or perhaps around midnight.
The strike, which will begin on Monday, will have to face significant difficulties in transport: railways will be shut down indefinitely, some public transport in Budapest may be stopped in the morning and more than half of the bus transport services of Volan companies will be stopped.
Simultaneously, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names being constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a fixed time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railways and the Free Union of Railroad Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement on minimum services, but as Christmas parties approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educators' Unions called a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will strike nationally at alternate times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new concept to social debate.
The second demand is that the new form of pension calculation be introduced gradually, which will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, that the occupations that deserve them can enter the system for early retirement.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and is waiting for another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, established in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company's 'risk warning' states that the greatest political risk in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard is the fact that 'with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur'.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke such an event - added the representative of the research institute.
They claimed that this was due to one of the main flaws of the leading figures in Hungarian political life: "the leading figures in public life gave the public debate on the Gypsy problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing differences between Roma and Hungarians".
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict - they estimate.
In addition, the National Guard's activity, according to the research institute, "damaged Hungary's image abroad significantly, especially in terms of stability and democratic development".
They remind us that since the autumn of 2006 the reorganisation of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and momentum and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organisations have been established in the country which define themselves as 'national self-defense associations'.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, public order defense), alluding to the inefficiencies of the police, the army, that is, the State" - they add.
They said that all this was done in accordance with the method which attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Member States.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring States the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region", they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in a similar way to the Bulgarian National Guard, for example, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The Bulgarian Guard was formed as a result of the mass Roma riots in one of Sofia's neighbourhoods (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, yet the state has remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls Political Capital.
They added: This initiative has sparked a lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they will form their own guard to resist.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary will also react to the threat in a similar way, organising their own self-defense - you can read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital's research director, Attila Juhász, said that risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As you said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party doesn't always write in red numbers.
In Hungary, the law defines precisely the days that are written in red numbers on the calendar and it has become a common practice that around the holidays - which will be less in the coming year - workdays are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, parties are not uniform.
Hungarian laws make a distinction between national holiday, state holiday and public holidays.
The holiday days are primarily related to religious and historical festivals.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are festive - the latter especially so that those who have spent the old year celebrating can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and on 23 October, a day commemorating the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1st the feast of labour, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country, there are two-day festivals - Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so often a bridge is made when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for such long weekends, you cannot be absent from work or school on the previous Saturdays.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when exactly you have to work in exchange for the day immediately preceding or following the party.
This legal standard is compulsory for all employers and their employees, as well as for public employees and civil servants.
It is not compulsory for companies and service institutions which, because of their function, work continuously even during the holidays.
This year the work schedule may only be altered around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December onwards, life in the country is practically halted, as experience shows that most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year, several of our holidays will coincide with mid-weekends or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The work day agenda will be amended so that workers can rest for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that in return Friday, May 2, will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the 23 October holiday: on Saturday 18 October, work will have to be done instead of Friday 24.
The year ahead, however, will be a resting day, since from 24 December onwards almost no work will be done anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to make your colleagues' lives bitter
Emails we forget to send, noisy messages we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing it: they are all part of our everyday folklore at work.
You must decide whether to adapt to minor annoyances or to consciously avoid confusing situations that may irritate others.
I'll give you some advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you've been wanted by the marketing department", says one of your colleagues".
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best, if you feel sorry for it and try to fix it, you may call the marketing department to tell them you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time, the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before making any kind of vague explanation, it is worth meditating on the things you can do to make your colleagues' lives bitter and consciously trying to avoid them.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you want to grab a document, an office utility, or your phone and you can't find it.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it was gone?
Do you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll rightly be angry with you for taking their stuff.
Don't take envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before the time.
You gossip about the private lives of your colleagues?
There's no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information (guessing) you have about the private lives of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his closest secrets with you!
Bury what you have heard in yourself, and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others know about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office and say that you are sick and have an unbearable headache, that you feel sick or well, you feel that you prefer to rest that day; think about others doing your work, your duty-free tasks, your work on time.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that you won't be going to the office the next day or something might happen to you, so you should stay home, let them know, so that your colleagues or your boss won't have to confront your absence the next day.
The tarareos, the laughter, the phone calls.
You're in your job, but you're suddenly getting rid of it by your colleagues?
Have you inadvertently heard a phone conversation that you should have not listened to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with your bullshit, singing, loud conversations (except when you do them over their head), constant gossip, blasphemy, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not currently deeply involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something on time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don't point to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must admit that you have made a mistake that harms others and you must make amends!
Ask how you can make up for your loss!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and sneakers: Very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don't wear a comfortable jogging suit even if your occupation allows it!
Be not disorderly, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation so demands!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning jam.
There's a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
The rhythm of the music changes and the bass is added to the previous tones and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national music life didn't screw us up much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jamming seems totally different when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although garage-style rock is once again fashionable, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has proven: there are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in Pécs, played in the ensemble of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he tried to succeed, when they asked him for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
The wider public got to know the ensemble which initially only performed in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album edited in 2002 among the top fifty national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, able to sell itself also in the Western markets.
There's no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they like to wear this label.
The band reacted as it should: they prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to airy, to flying is fine, but in addition to the airy music, now appeared - in keeping with the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds the loudest, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a true hit from the mr2 Petõfi channel which has recently been broadcasting popular music from morning to night.
Is everything all right?
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: what is the music you're playing, to what extent is it a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of a select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of cast in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also, so-called alternative underground music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally for sale only, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
BZ: Overseas, especially in the West of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the 15 and 20 year olds attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that are taking place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they're from, and how many people are listening to your music?
BZs: Naturally, I feel good about seeing more and more people come to our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is felt rather in concerts where there is a mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo and made his career rather west of us.
BZs: We don't follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music to his.
We work in teams, trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us started our career in their group and from there we took another path.
In Mr2's hit list Petõfi Wings of Love is number one.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
ZSB: We didn't intend to compose big hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the record, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the record and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why them - what was the main reason?
BZs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
So the idea came to create this choir of good vocal soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus, a six-woman choir was created - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later renamed as the Divas of Underground.
HW: Did you write the song exactly like that or did the girls change anything?
ZSB: This song was in an instrumental version a long time ago and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came down to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas too.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
Hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the album it looks like the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's brief solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and no louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their songs.
They're also in the background on stage.
- Intentionally?
BZs: They're in the background just because of technical issues.
Instead, we consciously didn't want to distribute solo roles.
The song also speaks about it, about forgetting our ego for a while, about who came from where and where is going, so let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted to make others feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What did you do most of the work?
ZsB: In music composition, actually none, rather when it came to mixing, there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls where for a long time the groove didn't want to work and then, little by little, everything got in its place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
ZSB: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "squeezed" the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal and unfaithful man.
This is what his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Commercial Bank, points out.
He lost about five billion euros for it.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, no doubt, with good abilities.
It was a long time ago that, unlike all the major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market began.
"He has a fragile character" he was told by his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what Kerviel's answers show from what French media outlets, such as Le Monde, report, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros from his business.
Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank", he says in his answers.
In fact, in the summer, he managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity already saw it coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages being offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis was not to affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet correctly.
And then, by the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I earned my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him", Kerviel admits, adding that he has left nothing for himself, not at all.
During the entire interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not made.
He even cheated the bosses, even when the Eurex Exchange started to take an interest in their business.
The risk turned to the benefit
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
No, I'm not.
"I thought I had earned $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, it would make them happy".
Where did he get so much willpower to risk himself like that?
My position was to be worked on gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was managed between $51,000.
Two years later she was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 she became a stockbroker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Still, I knew I'd never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress", Kerviel described the researchers.
But soon after I joined the company, my first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's stock, he won, during the London bombings, playing down a 500 million euro title.
And this was a trigger mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll let you
"This is like a snowball", the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"As I made money, they closed their eyes".
Only, then, the coup came earlier this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase all traces.
When he got to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get a hold of him?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who has no vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to look at his file", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the potential to get 365 billion
The Czech Government's ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
The seven operational programmes will provide approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22% of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the Fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure which next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, industrial research and the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
As regards the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly-admitted countries that use them the least.
Twenty years' imprisonment for the former president of Nicaragua, court ordered
Nicaragua's appeals court on Thursday sentenced the country's former president, Arnaldo Alemán, to 20 years in prison, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 billion (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, he was released from prison a short time later to go under house arrest on his farm not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP, that the then head of state of Central America between 1197 and 2002 is back in jail.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on the prison agents if they let German finish his sentence at home or if they bring him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved how German was constantly transferring government money to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to his closest relatives and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund German created to fund his campaign in the 2001 election.
That's how we got our budget approved.
That's right, I'm not.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It's the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year has already been approved with the support of the ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from the various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, though the most influential, passed the new law with calmness.
It's a big paradox.
Every government starts and ends with every chapter and budget start, like it or not.
Budget is an important part of politics but it is the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important to the media and therefore receives special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last Social Democratic governments suffered from three shortcomings which for this year 2008 cannot be solved so easily:
The first is the high participation of mandatory laws, called the expenditure of the president, which are not only pensions but also social benefits that were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public financing, such as the municipal and Community budget deficits.
The biggest risk, however, is not the State budget deficit.
This one's public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment besides tax money, fees and bank credits, often issued meaningless bonds with which they owed their town halls disproportionately.
In recent years they have been able to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatisation.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we just look at the official, verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, is going through growth phases just like the rest of the world, which the Socialist Party boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the state finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to get into debt.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some countries like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved far more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, especially in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that, within global measures, are less threatened by poverty.
That is why we do not need massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been unnecessarily inflated in recent years with huge measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the election, if soon the retirement age and pension reforms are not changed then it will be the real end of any policy in this country and whoever rules will be just a simple bureaucracy.
We can exaggerate a little bit by saying that the politicians who govern will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending from the spending of the president.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the previous government had not wasted what it could in the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become just officials, so we must be patient and give this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it can get from taxes and fees, the peace of mind to prepare for other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.
The following is the list of the countries of the European Union:
Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the money market, more than a hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders.
In these tenders banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the US Fed will send forty billion dollars to tender, and then another twenty-four billion dollars will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continued growth in the lack of free capital that banks could lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group in his report to customers.
"This coordinated action by central banks likely reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent 60 billion dollars on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what's yet to come when they decide to take this step", said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks fear they will have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid of borrowing money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move by central banks contributes to the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the fall in the US housing market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change affects developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his views on the problem of global warming.
The criticism has now come with the closure of the UN's international climate change conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not a Green Planet, he commented that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
Klaus said it was unacceptable not only the conference structure that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There are hardly any structured debates, they are artificial fireworks, substitutes for the solution to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President underlined during the presentation of his book that this topic is very important to him and that he is therefore interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said "a lot of times I only find the caricature of my ideas".
Interested parties can now inquire about their various opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climate scientist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of closure he expressed his view that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence climate development are futile, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Moreover, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained to the audience that he was not against "reasonable environmentalists but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driving licence
Six hundred thousand drivers were overdrawn and therefore could not change their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can request the change so officials can give them until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be found on the roads without a valid driver's license.
According to traffic, the license has not been changed mainly by those who no longer want to drive.
While in villages the change of carnets is declining rapidly, the metropolitan offices are full of requests and interest in the new carnets has increased.
The city council calculates about 2,000 customers a day.
You've been in line for half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet been issued their new driving licence.
The issuance of a new licence lasts 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the licence within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their driving licence and do not reach the end of the year but will leave the roads without the valid licence will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the breach with a warning.
If it is an administrative offence, the fine will be 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine could be imposed on a person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of a thousand crowns, maximum.
According to the transport ministry's spokesman, Karel Hanzelka, the 1,000-krona fine does not threaten anyone.
According to him, a driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not the ID card that every person should have.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued in 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licence.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the licence issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence of Berdych's accomplices.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych, will spend between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided that the penalty should be reduced to one year and the second to two years.
Prague's organized crime detectives were initially to be sentenced to 14 to 12 years.
The decision of today is no longer subject to appeal, only by the Supreme Court's revocation.
Berdych is also charged in this case but he is expected first of all to be sentenced by the Court of First Instance.
Despite this, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years in other trials.
You can't get any more.
In January, the district court recognized involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the high court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' allegations were dismissed by the investigation as fabricated.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped members of a criminal group avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charges relate to criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the theft, its victims suffered serious health impacts but are also accused of abusing power as public officials and without a permit for weapons.
In the home search, police found some pistols, steel core ammunition, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The criminal group, the prosecution says, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for almost a dozen men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men involved in Berdych's case are still reporting other trials, and in some cases they haven't yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland awaiting final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account for changing a few kids: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home, the lawyer for the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million crowns of compensation from the hospital in Třebič plus the costs of the trial.
For each mother, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, is in principle not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We don't approve such a demand, it's too high", Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescissive value.
We are of the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all", Dostal stressed.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for every month they didn't raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The girls' parents, according to psychology and psychiatry specialists, suffered from psychic impact and stress of varying levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better endured by the men although they fought with recriminations over the change of the girls.
Women are worse off with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by nurses at the Třebič maternity home last December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový family in Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
Vysočina governor Miloš Vystrčil handed each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for the mistake made at the Třebič hospital that the region administers at the end of October.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liabilities for damages.
In case of errors they must be withdrawn from the reserve fund and may exceptionally ask the administrator for assistance.
The court has so far granted them a proportionately low compensation, the sums calculated according to the tables counting in the hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolekívka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom of Wallachia brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava provincial court he was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear for oral arguments today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone gets the image of the actor and comedian.
Harabiš has the same idea.
"We've been working for about ten years.
Money-seeking and inventing activities", he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something for it.
They want to live like parasites of our work", he added.
A profitable business
According to the court the brand Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polívka in her television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about guiding him toward the creation of a fictional realm.
A few years later Harabiš came up with the idea of editing the passport for the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From this comic origin came a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the company Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use her name and signature on passports and even offered discount to her owners to visitors to her farm and attendees of her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia", the judge said.
He added, however, that Harabiš and his team were in the spirit of the project and dedicated themselves to it.
The collaboration between the now-decomposed parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organised the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began to arise between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the forever chosen".
The leading role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, led to the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his company which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with his princesses, which Harabiš is already preparing.
He should be the new king.
He hasn't wanted to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're not in any hurry.
It's got to be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can come forward", Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: prejudices overcome
I've never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its gear characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuverability and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there's a successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and this one, it's much better.
This combi called SW is a little more advanced and I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, about the headrest space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I go in there quickly so I don't repeat too much.
It's an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here, the invention of design would be more valuable, although the car already looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and back-ups.
Also unlike the 206 model, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space, and here you can feel how the body dimensions have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned scarcity of space in the head disappears.
Bags in the trunk
But the main thing about this vehicle is its trunk.
I must assess this as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear gate) and well-allocated storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps which are an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can spread to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, it has a capacity of 428 litres as a basic product, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
But not in comparison with the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that Peugeot lags behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
From a vacation abroad or when placing the child's stroller, their value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I should mention the floor that is pretty flat after I knocked down the second line backs.
120 horses in four marches
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition on a 1.6 litre capacity and a power output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's what a 1600 should look like if it belittled the five-door family.
It's quiet, it consumes little and, above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the Skoda days of the day when it looked like the exhaust pipe was covered in a cloth, I can say that I can be impressed with this one.
Prices are right
The price of the car is not for everyone.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested a vehicle with a very good engine and a very elegant equipment.
The basic price of the car with the injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our officers put it at 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we'd still have airbags in the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield cleaners, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, it costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it's got the team supplements at the Fabia and it'll come up with a pretty similar number.
Now all we have to do is decide which of the two marks.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
English schools are attended by children from Eastern European countries and local people fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern town of Kent where conflicts between the natives and Slovak immigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and student-to-student protests have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the police in Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist language.
Police had to act also after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls beat him up with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"As we were walking home, a boy came to us at the bus stop and began spitting on us.
When I told him to leave, he made us throw apples and pears, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his ass", the mother of the Slovak student described another disgusting incident for The Times.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even referred to the conflict with Eastern European migrants as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show us how the atmosphere in English schools is starting to get rather tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks registered here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, provided you choose right.
Sandy, golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
The palm trees and everything included with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean island you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island is there much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo of the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew up in the late 1920s.
He had it built by one of the American mafia chiefs, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore, banned) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, and all that.
In Havana, tall buildings were built, and cars were running along wide avenues that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Gate, the stars of the entertainment world and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Abánense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, you can have your cocktails mixed up to your liking.
And those cars that were already a cult classic in the 1950s, they still run in Havana today, because those Lada and Fiat cars that came a long time ago have been rusted in these wet, salty winds.
Although Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating markedly, there are not as many marvelous colonial monuments around as there are.
Other places are transformed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railroad lovers.
Sugarcane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for decades were undiscovered and now they're there, machines that work and whose sister models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous place for most visitors doesn't change.
And for that, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not miss visiting.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
lush vegetation growing on limestone rocky land.
The valley's falls are steep, limestone pilons and steep cliffs, and in their caves, fertile land is acclimated, which gives rise to rocky outcrops that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco in Cuba is grown.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories can find your final product.
Perhaps it's interesting to some that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
The Trinity
Old Abolengo town that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the construction in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is so remote that even in the 1950s there was no road linking it to the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed either, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, it is worth visiting interesting places nearby such as Ancón Beach or the valley of the sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the morning.
Other, of a kind used for the manufacture of goods
A small town in the westernmost tip of Cuba, considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
That opinion is certainly already confirmed by the way.
The two roads that go there from Guantanamo must pass through high, broken mountains, as well as through nature that barely knows man's actions.
This eastern part of Cuba has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and which now has a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patroness of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, Santería, the African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of this could fill many pages.
But, as they say, it's best to see him sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, the Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment is what's influencing the mission's progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
As conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one solution.
The next step is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own", Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
The ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to US military data is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of whom are in the southern part of the territory.
However, for the United States, the Allies have reached the same limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
They're asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We're going to have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we're going to achieve them", Gates said.
In a similar vein, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not much", De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The countries that have been assisting in the past few months have been debating whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was passively criticized.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands for fighting there are not as high as ours, in the southern and eastern parts of the country", Gates said.
The sensationalist Sun newspaper this week called the German soldiers vague.
"Afghan rebels discover that Germans are playing while our boys are fighting", Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph of British troops playing a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The state debt will reach a trillion by 2009
For each Czech, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt in September was 842.7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement in the state budget's economic development.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In nine months this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has fallen to 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt from early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the State has borrowed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the one trillion-krona border by 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crowns", said Patria Finance economist David Marek.
The economist at Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, also says: "We could pass the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the political scene were to change and politicians could save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don't see such a change", he added.
Doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The State debt is paid by means of Treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z krones since June was reduced by 13.7 billion krones.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total interannual debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly by bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a reform of pensions", said Pikora.
Better than expected
The government's 2007 State debt management and payment strategy shows that it planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
In early December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement in the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget which this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13 300 million kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner for the financing of state obligations and 1.8 billion kroner in payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
He was comparing himself to Khartoum today in court for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Jhartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The Briton was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was punishable by a whip.
This 54-year-old British schoolteacher from Unity High School in Jartum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with Islamist attack and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her 6- and 7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear in her class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of children, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 out of 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear photo with the following legend: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that the representation of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that would be offensive to a religious faith, "I'm sorry just that I asked the kids to vote for a name", which he said was just an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many of the schoolteacher's pupils who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils" and "never speaking about religion in class"..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most common name in Britain, written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
It is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo have concluded a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach agreement on the statute", European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "on the line", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not anticipate violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period", he added, noting that "evident tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their final visit to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian, could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last round of negotiations since the Troika was given new mediation by the UN last August.
The United States and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said Botsane-Khartchenko.
The declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West considers independence under the supervision of the European Union the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim her unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in her favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached", Kosovo's autonomous authority president Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the Baden hotel where these 'last-of-its-kind negotiations' were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former Kosovo rebel commander and future provincial prime minister, has given some of his grievances.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations.
" The effect dominated "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise is always feasible, warning the majority of Kosovo's Albanians against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade says it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that compromise is impossible".
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia", said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council".
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the statute", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the West.
Bush starts an Israeli-Palestinian agreement
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he met himself on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations to the peace itinerary they agreed on in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority would seek "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including the central issues".
This denomination covers the three main acute issues of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and address all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things".
On his return to the podium, Olmert pledged to ensure that the forthcoming negotiations were "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them by the end of 2008".
Bush set the deadline for the implementation of his "two-state vision" of coexisting Palestinian and Israeli states at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose involvement in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a turning point in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saoud said in his interview with Saudi capitals.
The prosecutor thinks the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As with every such event, official versions and rumors are contradicted.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the French National Police Inspection General (IGPN), a police car was in circulation on Sunday, shortly after 17h, on Luisa-Miguel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not in intervention but on patrol, and he was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating light", a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "not approved, that is, not authorized to drive on public roads" (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was "all gas".
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the right-hand pass", police said.
Alcohol controls on the occupants of the vehicle were negative.
The condition of the car (the front of the car collapsed, windshields cracked, bumpers ripped) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation into "incidents of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance" to IGPN, in coordination with the departmental administration of public security in Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation at this stadium dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the police's version, namely that this mini-bike arrived relatively quickly to his left".
Yesterday, a sort of groove, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the footwear on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to come to a halt.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical examination.
Both victims' bodies were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing aid to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also disregard 'any serious wrongdoing' in this regard.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs further investigation, about which we must be very careful", a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness to these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that looks exactly at the scene.
"We immediately went down with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them", says this witness.
There was nothing to do".
Then he saw a completely scared cop, who was slumming.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone".
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to the witness, the rescue came "about twenty minutes after the police marched".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not assume that the police services did not bring assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The fire department came right up.
Everything has been done to try to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf's state of emergency was imposed two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting the emergency measures have been wounded by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter replied with stone shots, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the crowd.
Other demonstrations were reportedly held in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The law enforcement movement on Monday picked up the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced against the state of emergency and the waste to whom they swore before Musharraf".
" Musharraf 's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned with the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the coming days about the legality of re-election to the presidential election, on October 6, by indirect vote, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court", the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "no longer counts" after the state of emergency was imposed, he told information assistant minister Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to drop his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is unplanned, reveals a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5 to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has, however, allowed for a better "fecundity dominance", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little bit more or less a month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, the season judged to be the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his International Space Station (ISS) crewmates more than seven hours of space work to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that set records because of its length, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, instruments "chapped" by astronauts to perform repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts released the Harmony module from the Discovery launch vehicle, a thick cylindrical piece designed to soon house European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see framed).
This module is a type of landing pad for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5 ton solar panel electricity production module already present on the ISS to its final position.
After displacing it, the crew began reorganizing the module's solar panels that have a span of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which are deployed like accordions, has been damaged in a little over or under a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to damage the panel further.
The astronauts, who were initially to perform a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go scow at the end of the 30-meter-long remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to the station to perform the repair.
He's one of the best spacewalkers at NASA.
Tall, tough, very skilled, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained physician has been commissioned to "operate" the "wounded" solar panel.
After inspecting the damage precisely, he cut the folding cable and installed "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second spacewalker who had stayed close to the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts like Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution on the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "chapped" by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making inventory of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were taking advantage of a midday rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for their planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS securities sanctioned on the stock exchange
EADS' stock is currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aviation and defence group announced that it will have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS is currently losing 4% to the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The group has been forced to revise its forecast of the operating result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost of mitigating the delay in delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", the European manufacturer EADS's parent company announced.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without further encryption.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the EADS operating result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to delays in another programme, the very heavy-duty A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the ballot box: Russians will vote massively for President Putin's party, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a televised message to voters on public networks, already recorded but with secret content.
He is doing so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory turns out to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything go unnoticed by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of meddling - his theme of preference during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and open elections, elections without incidents", he added.
According to the opposition, we're far from the truth.
He's denouncing a campaign stained by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, even in the time of Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on last weekend's demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the Soviet homo mentality"
Behind these unexpected legislative elections lie two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to be announced.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek a third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in the legislative elections as well as the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel owners of their destiny", estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society in this Christianized country was lagging behind five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin reestablished the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disengagement", estimates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "willfully renounce personal responsibility" for those who had briefly proved themselves after the breakup of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the Russians not voting for extremists either.
The conclusion of 54-year-old Tamara Tcherednitchenko: "Why reflect?
Those in power aren't too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not available for "humanitarian" purposes only, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his right holders.
The eleven states responsible for its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open it to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process for this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow searches "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced labourers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the public disclosure of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
Records of the concentration camps or of the detention orders established by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or forced labourers and, eventually, to provide proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents", said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between the two countries is already at around 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's top trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union's foreign ministers had last April approved the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India's top trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly dop both economies" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", Peter Mandelson justified.
The European Commissioner said that Europe was the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India.The Asian and European giants trade for "47 billion euros of goods" and "ten billion euros of services" annually, said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential".

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current round of credit conditions concerns, and announced a £10 billion offer at the base rate of 5.75 per cent in five weeks, an unusual offer of duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period starting on 6 December as an open market operation for five weeks", it said in a statement.
The bank says 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, at the base index and until 10 January.
It is the first time it seems that the Bank of England BoE has put liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it is "prepared to take other measures to maintain the indices" of interbank loans up to date in line with its base index.
The interbank daily rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months was 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumours, supported by the evolution of the pound's exchange rate against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, to the more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties refuse to consider the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss articles in the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was included in a socialist "niche" (a session on the initiative of a parliamentary group), rejected a dozen measures adopted by the PS national office on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in surplus wages for employment, the re-establishment of the floating TIPP (internal rate for petroleum products), a transport check or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was called off at the end of the general discussion which resulted in exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming to light
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with someone who inspired, more or less, the current movement of festivals in America", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the running of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts around 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organising of the Glastonbury Festival, which now can hold up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he's ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as our marketplace and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we're stuck in low-level policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones chases.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional venue that will, ultimately, take place in Philadelphia".
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after having unfurled the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, whereas ours is more of an urban green", says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, one way or another, both formulas to give both a rural festival impression in the European way and an urban impression in the American way".
Vineland's about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life".
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very big", like the 80,000-person Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been issued to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
"Vineland will have a rock flavor, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators", says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3 members, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal:
Montreal is facing Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood movie sets into Montreal when nothing but Terminator is opposed to that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the " runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where you go.
If he finds conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our role, is to offer those who will judge the best", he says.
The race to the festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oscars is about to begin.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them value and make sure the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages got a good showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It's being presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the Santa Monica billboard and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival, in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Are there any end-of-year rallies?
Less than five weeks into the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in stock markets tends to have positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made on the basis of statistics alone, especially since uncertainties are looming in the markets today, at least in the short term.'
Although they are not supporters of the stock market taking a career in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values in both long and short terms".
They therefore believe that the stock market will behave more sideways, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulation by inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"There is no such thing as too much fun", the expert says.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the highs on 8 November when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be a little different this year as he believes the rally will be moved forward to the second week of December, after the Constitution Bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US as to the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree on the choice of values to take the Ibex to new highs.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year is about the big values".
The expert would include the two big banks and some manufacturers in the portfolio "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco says the increases will come from the bank and the industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they do.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC to follow their path", the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be the main player in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bear month only twice.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, when stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw a 6.68% rebound.
It will be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the time being the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and whether it can count on its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday through Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
The rest of the Spanish institutions, too, are the first to decide to make the jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 pm, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 pm.
Another group that has also repeatedly said it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to step in.
Meanwhile, he's about to close a deal with unions to close 75 percent of their offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive for other entities to take up this initiative, which is secondary to the trading schedules.
This is precisely the goal Popular pursues with the project.
Catch private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed and businesses from the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but a remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The commercial banking manager, Ángel Rivera, says that this restructuring is not a big investment, but a bigger recruitment of staff, as it has about six employees per place to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Angel Rivero.
The branches on the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others operate under the brand Mundocredit, which specializes in immigrants, also with very wide hours, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax locations, they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to make competition for our customers,' says Rivero.
So far, they've reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with outside staff at the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value of its competitor Antena 3 for the first time
We got it.
With that phrase he expressed yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect of his joy was stunted: 'It hurts me, not because we have grown more but because we have fallen less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54 percent advance.
That gain puts its loss on what we've been doing this year at 15.66%.
The value on the Stock Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488,88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday ceded 1.52% and accumulated a fall of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518,53 million for Prisa (five-day publisher) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenue this year, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising subsidiary.
If this figure were to become reality, the TV channel would see an increase of 3,6% in its advertising turnover this year compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
Net revenue of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net revenue of television grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is too early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in partnership with its Mediaset parent.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we can make our shareholders happy, who we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
Analysts say the market is showing signs of a certain tiredness.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
It is explained that it has cut its expected revenue growth from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the profit forecast of Antena 3 by 4,5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1. the number of days.
Ibersecurities: it recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
Caja Madrid: it looks better at Telecinco (accumulate) than Antena 3 (keep) for the 'multiple attractive' and business ups.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
JPMorgan: recommends that both cases be considered under consideration as they have 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to ensure investor protection and to regulate the activities of institutions in detail so that markets function efficiently.
The amendment to the Securities Market Law (Mifid) means the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (NMC) and encouraging cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new rules will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firm (ESIS), financial advisory firm (FCA), which will be linked to securities firms, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
It also expands the number of systems for executing transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The law also requires investment services firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management methods and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate monitoring by the CNMV.
The amendments to the Treasury's Economic Committee included a number of amendments, including the requirement that securitised debts be considered as a 'complex' financial instrument given their high risk to investors, as demonstrated by the US subprime mortgage debt.
The transposition of the directive was also used to legally limit the functions that graduates in economics and business can carry out 30 years after the actual decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
The Senate has also introduced new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide products marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonized CPI increases by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain developed during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with Eurostat and the European Central Bank's (ECB) policy of providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
'IPC will continue at relatively high levels'
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes has said that the rise of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he has vowed that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "even if the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential from monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%", the Minister of Economy said of the data presented today.
Virgin plans to raise 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen more than 50% to £12 billion since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, he was accumulating record deposits of over 25 billion pounds, a figure that has fallen gradually in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and that will remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rebrand the institution with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to collect about a quarter of the revenue in British banks deposited over the next three years to get those remaining £18 billion to the target of £30 billion.
The group of wealthy Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of Virgin's consortium, which includes three other companies, as its favorite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today at first hour of the morning the current mayor of the municipality of Totana Murciano (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the police chief of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then regitor of the municipality, and who according to sources of the investigation consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The police are still searching the municipal offices and the Urbanism department and no further arrests are being ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore, was stopped leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the subject of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban planning agreement with a Galician construction company to recalibrate 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and be president of the Congress in the event that the socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the secretary of the PSOE Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also pointed out that "it seems" that the manche politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono will replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for re-election and to abandon his career in active politics to fight climate change at the university level.
The former minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he takes office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not insults or screams".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunately that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and quietly is the Congress, the President of the Government at one time was interrupted in the Senate 26 times".
He also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not want to be seen already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, he said, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement mercilessly persecutes both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show an ironclad coherence.
And a leader of the movement who is the president of the government like Zapatero and believes that the fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in its failure to comply with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the breach, in what sectors it has occurred and why your government, the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
It also requires that it explain to the Spanish people with the utmost clarity what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences will have.
Which means who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have been and there will be no such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the penny of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero electorally that he hastened to deny it.
That is, it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it's limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and doesn't claim to be cycling or cooling off with the fan.
Mayor and police chief of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has detained the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local Police, the secretary of the City Council and a hostel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose dependencies he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urbanism and the municipal company managing the Industrial and Housing Soil.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalibration of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable so that the Galician company Nuaria build 4,000 homes, after paying illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which is instructed by the Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been brought to justice today.
According to sources, the former Totana regidor and now the PP's autonomous parliamentarian, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of an immovable agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former regidor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the Group cited, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is being carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Guardia Civil, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven registrations, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was arrested in Totana at the time, namely the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2,2 million square meters of land in Totana that was re-calibrated and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking lots near the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Piazza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that happen
1. the number of days.
If you like, let's just put the Book of the Month aside, see if we can think of another prize and other competitions in the meantime.
I'm already planning something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by far the leading PISA report on world education level), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that, curiously, Blackburn's book criticism appeared there:
"The content of the Philosophy signature has leaped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit, a bachelor's student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Education Councillor in charge of the Philosophy subject, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes".
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Penal Code of crimes on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a felony punishable by six months to a year.
If you steal discs in the store for less than €400, it is considered simply a failure (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to €1,000 from a store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still less than the charge for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than the discharge penalty (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to engage in a fight than to engage in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel is punishable by three months to a year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would be punishable by six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without authorization from authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague's right, someone's getting their hand out, a very long hand.
4 of the same name.
My GP gives me one of his rare research articles entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially when others receive less.'
That is, the feelings that the workers' monthly pay generates depend on what their colleagues earn.
The study was carried out by MRI at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and their partner failed".
The researchers observed that if when both of them were hit they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice, the activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor's office of the former Yugoslavia Criminal Tribunal, located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians were killed - former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on that list from which the Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach's documentary, 'Carla's List' (2006, not released in Spain) takes its title, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to chase the escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to close the siege.
How sure am I?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of an accident, is a significant expense which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Owning the car is just the beginning.
And it's that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of vehicle.
First, we have to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is made in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being liable for the obligation to pay damages in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, sex, age of the licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of the licence, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely you are to have an accident, the higher the fee to pay.
That is why both women and men over 25 must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk of injury due to prudence.
Also, by taking account of the numbers, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency and thus the likelihood of a crash.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurance companies take into account when setting the premium price.
The driver must therefore carefully consider the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will discuss here the most important variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 experience various disadvantages when buying insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and age of the car.
Although the ideal insurance is full-risk, there are other, cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a risk-free whole, so they get the coverage of an all-risk but at a more affordable price.
This type of agreement would require the customer to pay a part of the amount of the loss.
"The part of the amount of the loss that the customer contributes will be pre-established according to the premium value, which will be higher the lower the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, chief manager in Spain of First Europa, online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is protected against damage caused to third parties, but not to his own car.
Plus, he'd be covered for theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
I'll give you some advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the basic rate the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that basic rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses", explains Noguera.
After the age of 25, drivers have an easier time getting insurance, since the accident rate is reduced by accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire a full-risk franchisee.
"Normally young people cannot make use of previously acquired experience in the event of an accident, and even when driving", says the European company's Spanish director, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, after the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is preferable that he negotiates a full-risk insurance, as long as his financial situation allows, of course.
In addition, the insurance companies consider child marriages to be the lowest-risk public, so surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a one-off with a deduction (which can be 300 euros) or, where a high bonus level is available, a third-party insurance extended from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchisee", sentences Luis Noguera.
Retired persons are advised to have a full-risk insurance with a deduction of 150 euros or a third-party insurance extended when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, but also because it is a significant expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic are looking for a point worth eight in Milan
Milan and Celtic are meeting on Tuesday at the San Siro in search of the missing point to reach their respective goals in the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to decide their classification.
The Italians have scored 10 points and have already secured their pass in the fifth leg with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but they still need another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, and receiving Benfica, who has four, does not overtake them.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round is over, as Milan have to compete in the Club World Cup in Japan, where they debut on the 13th in the semi-finals in search of a place for the final of the 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although both teams will try to come out for a win, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic know that winning would stay first and ensure a better crossing in the eighties.
Gordon Strachan's team could even use a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't trust because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
The Milaners will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who are hoping to get into the eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal from Kaka in the extra time (1-0) after the 0-0 draw.
Waiting for the Rossoneri's victory will be Shakhtar who is only worth the win, in case he loses Celtic, both to get into the eighth and to stay in the UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a win, which would play UEFA.
20,000 people attend Vancouver's first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls have started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, before about 20,000 spectators since their dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their gig at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out tickets to attend the concert, which included a video that tells the story of the group that made a splash in the late 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincides with the release of a new album that includes their biggest hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of Spice Girls took to the stage wearing bracelets that were given to them by 'Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that surrounded GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had forbidden him days earlier.
In the preview of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "has not seen our dressing room, at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "by differences between us" led to the quintet's dissolution two years later, also expressed nervousness during a press meeting, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision", Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we all love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
Seven children are among the five.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over gas prices between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that Russia's fuel exports to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A dispute earlier last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge more to Ukraine, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks", Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine".
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "should test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, said a watchdog.
The recommendation by the auditor general Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was linked to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the number of foreign staff it has.
However, its report pointed to other controls being carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European Economic Area following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after he crashed a jeep into the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
The NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on applicants to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The auditor general's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should have guidance from the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review", says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information on the number of foreign NHS staff is available".
BMA Scotland president Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is", he explained.
The Scottish health authorities state that there are currently 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying employees with indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely followed.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the policy and guidance on the pre-employment of foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon says: "I had a great interest in this work being carried out in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the updating of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biographical film about the late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Best Film award.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast as Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for the thriller "Notes from a Scandal".
And Bond's lead character, Daniel Craig, won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - featuring the soundtrack to The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced for just £3,000.
But it was also won by Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, who won two awards - best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, which won the best documentary award.
The Best Actor award was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a London Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg's film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hardball, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The Fifty, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me", he declared.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor".
The Independent Film Awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants from terrorist cells who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
An eight-member cell of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the Abqaiq facility, the world's largest oil refinery, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by an "expert in missile launching", which has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis travelling to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants to fight allied forces and support the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered a heretic by the most extreme Sunni Saudis.
Al-Qaeda militants target many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by calls from Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to harass the country's pro-Western government - targeted government-associated foreign residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a major effort by the security forces, since five months of work", the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
The arrested also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose goal was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to militants.
Venus' climate can give an idea of Earth's future
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin Earth than had been previously observed.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and orbit similarly, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had similar conditions to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and it is eroded by hurricane winds and thunderstorms.
The results of the European Space Agency's Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a glimpse of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission says: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when two planets are so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to construct a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago".
Police seizing "enriched uranium"
A kilogram of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds sterling).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy of presidential candidates answering the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for broadcast among candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday afternoon, November 28, were more ridiculous than the one of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the Republican party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican Party in the run-up to next year's election.
It's not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to dial up when they heard ideas they liked: Broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The most violent word-of-mouth exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a leading figure in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing the illegal to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the say in being nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because both warned about immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and generally speaking, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China's toxic toys and other concerns about the outside world, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned uncomfortable when other issues emerged.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether diving into water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not believe literally in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent poll, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is rising in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns and his heated Wednesday debate statements.
They both have come out of the bottomless pit, because the two wings of the party have not come to an agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Labour sufferings
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but he still emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
They don't seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor are they sucking out extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour Party, worth more than £650,000 ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party has not reported him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls had no influence on his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The prosecutor's office lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative slam.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it's the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is walking irrevocably toward the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they find themselves incapable of governing.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he has no time left, that suspension is too much: public officials start to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press seeks bad news; and the government turns to the defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although I'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The Northern Rock problems and the authority registration tax, are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the exchequer.
And even if it's not directly involved in Blairish's counter-offenses - or "partner fees", the investigation into political party funding - voters can assume it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has been killed or directly defrauded.
And the remedy, painful though it is, is to give what Mr Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal over donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but he doesn't make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for big political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abraham's deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr Brown is so far not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but he is diluted in decision-making over a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as find a permanent and independent head for the Standards Commission on Public Life, which he has not had in six months, and he must also push for genuine reform of party financing.
This will require hard work by Labour in cooperation with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a party like Mr Brown.
But he has to face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is by acting with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural for a back fin to swim around excitedly.
Today, with the American housing market in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million in its U.S. consumer finance business, partly due to weak cardholders.
However, it's too early for panic.
The debt and crime rates are low.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third-quarter crime rate of 3.89 percent was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The decline in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represented a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of default) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty steady, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emissions volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to load credit card debt now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at liquidity flow than assets, so falling prices do not necessarily drive a change in borrowers' creditworthiness.
They can even work to outshine the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue to repay the mortgage decrease if the property is worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, paying off the card debt is on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions of mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or altering creditors' balances.
That should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid asset replacement.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reevaluate all loans", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a contraction in credit pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron
Three British bankers who were on trial for their responsibility for fraud with former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow were found guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found not guilty of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial transaction in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at Royal Bank, became a notorious cause in Britain for two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the Enron crash in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were that they had alerted Fastow in 2002 that they were the target of a government investigation into the downfall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed "NatWest Three" - alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of Enron scams, which helped their spiral of bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three British knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest for $1 million dollars.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the 20 million was left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers collected 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy to commit Enron's collapse.
The trio of Britishmen was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they needed to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide millions of dollars in debt or make its failing businesses appear successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than 60 million in market value and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were jailed last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers", says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for family private flights or for company presidents".
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millennium Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to lure new wealthy Russians into all sorts of products, from handmade mahogany yachts to diamond-encrusted car grilles worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks carefully at a bright orange Porsche at the stand next to his".
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us", he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets".
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialistic", says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
"Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's biggest consumers and spenders".
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the pie.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH's president, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires who make a total of $282 billion dollars, according to Forbes' list of richest people.
In addition, second-rate rich include 103,000 Russian billionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of personal wealth developments in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the living standards.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here", says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are perfectly prepared and men are very dignified".
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon attire, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a net carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract newly rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay for hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum plums, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
Tickets for the general public are 30 euros ($44.57 USD).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a Delft Royal Dutch porcelain stand in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, sellers said that wealthy Russians with a long history (from 10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited edition brands, which would not be displayed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people - cash millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists - fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress systems for $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold thread.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three chain-bracelet-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom, for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with beams embedded in Swarovski-coloured crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, will not necessarily drive on those wheels", says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars".
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity given the surge in real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash", he said.
"There's more of them than you think".
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with piles of fake one-million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors would stop to shake up piles of money, ask their friends to take pictures with their phones while resting on piles of money, or pick up a couple of million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", says Karryev.
"Capuce" surgery could be the cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance coming up White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police car showed up.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up", said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died".
Authorities knew the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by police, but works at the 212 West Scott Avenue home.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they're awaiting toxicology testing, although the results won't be available for a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death that has plagued the top ranks of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious", Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian".
She was protecting me".
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left behind two children, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the County Union Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities", Walsh declared.
"It's an ongoing investigation".
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
November 21 and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
It's been over a week and the authorities have said little about his investigation or the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh couldn't say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a marshy rose is located at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian is barking at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hanging from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
"She would say, 'You have to watch with this one or that one,'" she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing".
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were heightened by the reassuring comments of the US central bank's vice president.
Stock markets loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two at Ben Bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued financial market tensions.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid rising exchanges, Mr Kohn said the recent turmoil was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October".
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit record lows in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset losses from its investments in U.S. subprime mortgages.
Only 20 of those jobs are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13.289.40, while the S&P 500 broad index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at closing to 6.306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's top companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6%, and the French CAC40 was above 2.3%.
The report also highlighted the re-emergence of credit stress in the markets following a strong demand for a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which rated the loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Federal Reserve and the ECB's actions and to inject extra funds into the London stock markets strained credit and three-month "Libor" lending rates among British banks, the biggest increase since September, at 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara to court
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none of them is less important in the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the team that is on loan - with that particular title at least - is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, England manager, is starting to fill in offers to become national selector, and if not, part-time.
The one who doesn't get the sixth batting title will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It's not easy to pull what a man does to the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the bottom, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket is choice difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, were promoted to the board: there's only room for one of them.
Who's to say what's a good level for a cricketer unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a big influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time as taking a wicket and a batsman to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who is playing surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares for fit and bowls like the wind in the net.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 runs each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 on the same average, but they've both had their highs and can expect more of these.
Shah or Bopara's games at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a major player, and despite scoring a double century against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion in today's session at the Asgiriya stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greater experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There's arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early 88 in Bombay, 32 first-class centuries against only 6 from Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent track record against spin bowling.
But Shah made just ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lords, his home ground as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken some of his batting momentum from Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live on swords.
He gets caught up in nothing on the cricket pitch and his attitude was summed up as when he flipped his vehicle over at an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his team-mate who was staring at him from a distance, to say with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he's including his slippery pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, as he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean Shah doesn't stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work and fight Al Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, driving out the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and who were waiting for the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before 800 people from Damascus arrived in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned on private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that it's safe now".
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people", he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease for a moment.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa to Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped get Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and needed my support and that of my colleagues".
"That's why I came back today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were drawn to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops consolidated groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq", the Sunni said.
"I can't believe a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left it".
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, easing tensions.
There is a fear that a sudden surge in refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and start the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
As in the whole country, the Sarlandese only lack an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the 50th time to a non-Sarlandese that we are not French" - that was the ironic motto about themselves from the smallest federal state for its 50th anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a large role in the education system in the Saarland, which in a study by the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" came in fifth place.
Thus, the higher education institutions traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their university career here with two or three degrees.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than the average in secondary schools.
"The vocational education system is being used in the Sarre", says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than one in five young people graduate from a vocational school, so the Sarre is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for vocational-academic education is very wide.
The offer of dual racing, in relation to population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by one third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre forced higher schools to do more advertising for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we have made some reforms in general education schools", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative testing across the country.
To get children to start studying the final year of the Kita-Jahr project as soon as possible, it is free of charge.
Comparison with the upcoming studies will show whether students' performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students with school development delays fell from 29 to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saarland didn't improve as much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, students are better at calculating.
To the dismay of the Sarlandese, the PISA report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although they could achieve good results in this field.
Although the Sarlandese are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in secondary schools.
Chávez changes the time.
Soon there will be another time zone in Venezuela that is different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez allows the time in the South American country to be changed by delaying the clock by half an hour.
Currently, Chávez is staying as a comedian in Spain.
As the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State has reported, according to the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
This will give the South American country a time zone that no other country in the world has.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would impose an obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the action with hostage taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so", says Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas on the release of hostages.
On Sunday, Chávez said in a critical tone that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
In Spain too, much is said about Chávez.
A new tone of voice is causing a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuing interruptions by leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong downturn.
Experts present a plethora of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault is the weak wage growth, the rise in value-added tax and the tightening of food and energy prices", reported Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research.
The new burden of unemployment insurance may also be borne by employees.
Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from year to year is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the Labour Office does not have to get into a disagreeable situation again, asking for loans and subsidies from the Federal State, according to a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food and oil derivatives sector reached its highest level in 13 years.
Compared to last year, prices are rising by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of Earth.
Despite its atmosphere not being suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not been proposed before.
For three decades, researchers suspected that there might be lightning on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, the rays are silent from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, to the scientific journal Nature.
According to the famous Urey-Miller model of the origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms could have triggered reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
Venus is not like that: if there were ever life there, it would have to be in one of the first states of evolution", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Maybe Venus is a 'devil' twin of Earth, but she's still a twin", Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there have been no special missions since the 1990s, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for research of Venus.
The latest results of the research, which will be presented in many articles in Nature, according to the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that the neighbouring planets have more characteristics in common with Earth than we had previously thought", reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers have also discovered a vortex of clouds in the south polar region that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind currents in the high earth atmospheric layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the solar system has a mass almost equal to that of Earth and is almost as large with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers.
This planet, also called the Dawn Star or the Evening Star, orbits the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars, does not resemble Earth much, scientists assume that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets, water had clustered, which on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated itself in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus most of the atmosphere is formed.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the party-to-party fight over the Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for the Dalai Lama's reception.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation", Koehler told the newspaper Handelblatt.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the Dalai Lama's reception by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"While I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me", Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must act with great balance in meddling in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when pursuing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows it too", Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in China-Germany relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation from Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), Germany's Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources in the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians to welcome the religious leader of Tibetans to his official position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words demonstrated that he was trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that riots like those in France will occur.
Street fights with police, gunfire, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social discontent in Germany from taking to the streets.
Barricades were made, vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots by young people in France, Federal Minister for Internal Affairs Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must also make sure that the social problems of our country do not take the form of violence".
"We have to take that seriously", he said in the newspaper Neue Presse, published in Hannover.
Not all young people are developing in the constantly changing social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and the municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits".
It's still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same edifying and sociological problems as in France.
The youngsters were involved in serious riots on the streets with police north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of a mimic effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the performances are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 is above average.
We must see to it that more vocational training is provided.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control of families", greater than in France.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But despite everything, we have to be careful".
The aim is to "provide opportunities for young people to get jobs or vocational training faster".
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
Monday night to Tuesday about 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor's office, the deaths of the young people were not the fault of the police.
In the realm of Angela Wolke.
The actions far removed from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, show that the coalition as regards content has reached its final point and that nothing more must be expected from it.
But what country does the Chancellor actually live in?
After her desperate, indifferent and uncontained performance in the general debate in the lower house, she must say: she does not live in the country that should be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made against her for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy activities, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the lower house it was very clearly stated to all that this reproach was appropriate.
There was no interest or feeling in the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself this way: a very high-level policy that flies away from foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: climate change prevention: it praised itself very much for the decisions made at Heiligendamm, but it says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
Well, he's got a lot of expressions to get people to get a boost.
And so it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going for the branches.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, the inner problems are seemingly worthless.
Child poverty and worries about low-wage workers?
All he's doing is talking about that subject using subordinate sentences.
It's amazing how often you're wrong about talking about the childhood supplement.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It starts to stumble "as if it were in unknown territory", when it came to more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate over Republican presidential candidates on YouTube and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
Tensions between the candidates are evident from the outset.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a haven for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani responded to the former governor of Massachusetts by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: As the Republican group has so far not had a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, mostly to discredit their opponents.
The short 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to YouTube, also don't have much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power", was John McCain's reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam War veterans for refusing to recognize waterboarding as torture, a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown in a death simulation.
The public reactions in the St. Petersburg, Florida, room show that meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded loudly when they praised conservative values and denied raising taxes.
That way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong about that time", Romney explains, lamenting, and apologizing to people and television audiences for being an advocate for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, was unsure of what to say when asked what he thought about literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf rules without a uniform.
The day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
That's how eight years of military rule in Pakistan end.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after taking power with a bloodless military coup, the former general is now running the state for the first time as civilian head.
With his resignation as Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will very soon cancel the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the West.
Since the state of emergency was declared in the Supreme Court there have been many lawmakers who have supported Musharraf.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watyristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" took part in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written in the band's best era.
They were already very famous in foreign countries at that time.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has his box, his cables and especially his buttons in front of him.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is wearing a white shirt.
To your left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking out of the auditorium, is 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Rodelius, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes to its own sounds, including rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What's to be rebelled against here is this: The questions have accurately shown that the name of the band was echoing in people's minds, but it wasn't something so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misnomer Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to the members of the band Can 2003 from Cologne for their life's work, the room was filled with the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother would spend time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend.
Ignorance at home and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is difficult to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time I did not achieve a great effect on the audience, however, it was later obtained thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised much fame.
They were playing in the basement of the Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and later worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at the time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more like an artist's life full of surprises.
They say one day a harmonica song association banner appeared in the garbage, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages to using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just about getting to know yourself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griessem.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do occasional rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced their split.
Rother eventually got involved in esoteric issues and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since then has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album at Griessmer, that's thanks to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius' work, the band Neu! was rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized by public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
There's also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
So all the Krautrock influences to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was vacant.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by the special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future".
There are pictures of Harmonia with producers on a farm.
The story of the legend's development is shown in black and white photo projections, where you can see instruments with wires.
At the bottom are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach microphones to the organ and the drum so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects they had built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is what it should be.
Three people who are deep in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment she coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was always an English-origin term.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or by fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "68" here is right too, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On stage, you reflect very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music start and end?
That can break your nerves or give you a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere just needs more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But they both had little conviction.
Either the concepts are too much focused on action and shootings or both movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountains, but it was there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere was rediscovered.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and insignificant roles in women's films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is perhaps the most important argument to watch the movie "The Hunting Party - When a Hunter Becomes What He Pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and silly these days?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to show: basically, his role as a reporter in the war is a presentation of what Richard Gere could have done, if fate and the film industry hadn't been so merciful to him.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The film's meaning is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The movie is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another point, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two charges), the story about American war reporters going to spot a Serbian war criminal called "Avoid", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
So the stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountains twice to do something the army can't do, and each time it's a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we are introduced to Simon Hunt at the beginning, who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian who they're gonna kill later.
So "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters accomplish with impressive speed what NATO, the CIA and all the world's headhunters failed to accomplish for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to get their revenge in a fair way.
It's so bad, they're gonna want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, deeply human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, you can think of a very famous poem by Brecht.
This poem is about a mask of an Asian demon: "In the big wrinkles on his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be evil".
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not just the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently, he published in a newspaper that all the movies about Iraq made in Hollywood are flops.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always, a rule applies: when a star enters a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Across All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It's going to be at least a decade before Hollywood makes a good Holocaust movie, taking Schindler's List as an example.
Some movies already need more time. Classic works like the Vietnam War "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two television sets at home.
And that's because scriptwriters don't have the slightest repair (which is necessary to be able to) in telling good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" ended up being so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime was actually.
Maybe he shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Maybe you should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic, distant gaze from an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change".
The big cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally murdered and in Yugoslavia there will always be war.
Von Beust receives in response the negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue competing in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when you estimate the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that the resignation was "not good for the economic situation".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level".
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this draft but find a new long-term application "relating to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides", says von Beust in WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund, expected in early December, on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no opportunity".
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the comments made by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
"It is too early to let the opportunity slip away, if at this moment the plans are ruined", said Günter Ploß, HSB's director.
A waiver of the application is contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public High School Sports Federation (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for Universities for 2015 not as a "substitution" of the Hamburg Olympic Games.
Only last week the High School Sports Federation named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) group has condemned the Senate for not taking advantage of the time it has spent building houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the senate was delaying the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because it was in plans for the Olympics or the construction of houses", said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused a lot of excitement.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn't think of Andy Warhol.
Or did you?
Today, wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the 94 "type" Brillo-Boxs on this list are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, the Moderna Museet museum in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet museum, are fake, and nearly a hundred others of "Stockholm type", which are in circulation in the international art market, are also.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had soap powder cartons "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Museum Moderna Museet were exhibited hundreds of Brillo-boxes of cardboard.
These were not works of art, but exhibited copies (which were only objects).
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a few wooden Brillo-boxes, but they were not on display at the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses from that time now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered art history and auctions as the originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous museum director Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and displayed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hulten and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservators at the Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
The structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed plates.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet museum and adds that if the New York City "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission does not reach any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exhibits".
In July the Commission for Authentication formally announced that it accepted these "serious allegations" that they were soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers are surrendering in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the downfall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The head of the party, Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he couldn't answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial on Thursday for attempting a failed coup in 2003.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so suddenly he could settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
Apparently the military police who were supposed to watch over him had gone through their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blockaded the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President has called an urgent Security Cabinet meeting.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the soldiers' behavior.
"People are tired", Trillanes said.
"We call people to our ranks".
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The government's top critics called for a major demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months now, his government has been criticized for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that drew all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coups in the Philippines against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares in the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
You only have 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company's takeover.
There are also options for further increasing the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that it intends to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market with this step.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution holds the equity shares for a third party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day had a participation of almost 10 percent in the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17,4 million of the new shares worth 106,4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on marketing cooperation for DSL products.
"Let us strengthen our collaboration", the spokesman for United Internet explained.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet reported that initially, the two companies want to be happy with a ten percent stake in Freenet and are not exercising their right, meaning they are taking a 18.49 percent stake in Freenet.
That meant both companies kept all options, especially the stake in the anonymous company Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the holding company United Internet and Drillisch had a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
So they agreed that Drillisch would get the other 4 percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
