Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is now spreading, but it provides details that fossils generally do not, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the chestnut-brown color of this animal is on the surface with a carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery still provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-formed shaft, it was called a rachis, but there were other features of feathers  beards and barbels  researchers have argued that rachis were a late evolutionary development against these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for maintaining temperature or for sight. The researchers suggest that, even if this was the tail of a baby dinosaur, the sample shows adult hair and not a skin of a mouse.
The researchers caution that, even if it was the tail of a baby dinosaur, the sample showed adult hair and not a rabbit's skin.

In France, voting is a traditional low-tech experiment: the voter, alone in a booth, places a pre-printed piece of paper stating their chosen candidate on an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.

Candidates can bring their physicians to witness each stage of the process. At night, the volunteer votes are counted under heavy surveillance, following specific procedures.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services helped the driver to get out of the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was always in Edinburgh Sheriff Court being charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody pending trial, but any evidence found may be unclean because his image has been spread publicly.
This practice is common elsewhere in the UK but the justice system in Scotland has acted differently and the court has viewed the publication of the photographs as potentially disruptive.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "publishing pictures and other material of suspects is a sign that journalists are walking a dangerous line".
The Crown Office, which handled the cases, informed the press that no further comment would be made until at least the trial.
The document, according to the publisher, refers to border conflicts, which Palestine wanted based on the borders prior to the 1967 Mideast War.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel commanded a continuous military presence in the mountains for ten years at the time of the signing of an agreement while the PA agreed to abandon such a presence in just five years.
The organisers of additional pest control trials should be checked by the authorities, since the trials are monitored and their effectiveness assessed.
In cooperation with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected in the initial shooting operation received comprehensive rescue and training instruction.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) late in the evening.
This was Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the early removal of the CEP as part of a move to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's solution to the widespread protests against the regime that had begun in October.
Occasionally violent protests have been fueled by failed elections, some since 2011.
Some 60 cases of overloaded iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires that have caused four people minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it is aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company called "slightly less serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's unproven report "very likely"
The earthquake struck in the Marianas at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The emergency management office in the Northern Marianas said that no national disasters were reported to them.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman captured Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
A few prisoners were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead in the aftermath.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Soon after, the photographers switched places because the elderly woman had to use a washcloth.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began investigating premature labor during his free time.
His research shows that when the hormone is taken care of, it can accelerate the development of the fetus.
Xinhua reports that government investigators seized two 'black boxes' of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna still had the respect of fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the most beloved Extreme Queen. My favorite manager. Luna died on the night of the full moon. Just as different. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels comments that "Luna is as much a laughingstock as I am...but even more so...I love and miss her...and she is in a good place".
In addition to 1,400 people who voted in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Observer Prime Minister Julia Gillard admitted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share the view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the close of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic in the near future, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but her health was called into question because of her complaints.
He was unable to take medication needed to help relieve pain because it was banned from the Mulays.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number in the early hours of January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have originated by bringing water to the earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how the planets, especially the Earth, formed, since comets have been colliding with the Earth for centuries.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He describes the gossip as "political and absurd".
He is projected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system promoted by the FAA that will allow airplanes to fly short distances and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology in contrast to the older ground-radar-based technology that allows air traffic to control the pinpoint aircraft with great precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional vehicles will be installed and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be disused below.
Fears of lack of transportation raise the possibility that the households will be forced to live behind closed doors by unwilling supporters of the group.
A study published by the Huibes in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species evolve in just two generations, though this process is believed to take longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migrating cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into a variety of shapes. It can be ground into tiny shapes.
It can be woven on thin yarn, which can be twisted and stitched together.
It can be made too thin, and then etched onto other metals, and it can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make a mark with the red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen (the H at pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons named after their electrons (since Hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Bake the two dry powders and then, with clean, clean hands, grind them into balls.
The sound in your hands reacts with the outer layers, which become audible and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of the funerary system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared a common company.
If you were calling someone thousands of miles away, you were using a satellite.
The space satellite receives a call and then is quickly sent back down.
Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs some of our light and reflects it.
A giant rocket over 100 feet [100 m] in height is needed to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bike has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the bike has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below this is a just-sized herd of goats that have eaten just-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and one.
Eventually, many of the smaller goats (including the unrestrained female goats) eat smaller prey such as insects, worms, snails, and birds.
The secret to their success was the concept of local adaptation, a special function of each goat that would prevent it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all goats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride is completed by one to three mated males of the right age, along with up to thirty females and children.
Women are usually close together, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behaves like wolf or dog groups, lion-like animals (but not big goats) are the norm, and they are equally lethal to their prey.
A formidable athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and score five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four are the only cats that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not the same as the full sound of the lion's roar, but it is more like a sound of violent, shouting words.
The ocelots are predatory, preying on small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, lizards, and birds, wherever possible.
Scientists think that the ocelots follow and seek prey (victims) by sniffing, sniffing where they land.
They can see well even in the dark with night vision, and they still act in secret. The ocelots catch their prey by swarming around them and then luring them away.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the dominant population from which it came (as when it moves to mountains or rivers, or when it moves to a new island so that it cannot quickly move again) it usually finds itself in a different environment from where it was before.
This new environment has a wide variety of resources and a wide variety of competitors, so the new population will need a wide variety of qualities or adaptations to be a strong competitor to what they once needed.
The original population has not changed much, still needing the same adjustment as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to appear to be in decline like other populations.
In the distant past, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations would be different in appearance and could no longer be called the same creature.
Specialization, as we call it, is an inevitable process and an important part of evolution.
Plants can produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they can also take in carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., breathe out).
Plants derive their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, we eat mostly plants, and without plants, animals cannot live.
The top-heavy spider of its age, the mosasaur, is the only one of its kind.
Its long jaws are filled with a cluster of 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing can escape its path.
We cannot be certain, but it may have had a sharp tongue, and it ate along with the sea bass, the big fish, some mosasaurs, and perhaps even the cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
While we may be familiar with the exquisiteness of their food, the Romans had equally miraculous or unusual festive items, including wild boars, paboreals, breasts, and a type of worm called a dormouse
Another difference is that while poor men and women ate their food while sitting on benches, the rich preferred to sit on their sides while eating their food.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted pepper.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods that they considered to be the home of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was open only to priests.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes erected to serve as temples.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a home is not important.
Much of the Hebrew family life was outside.
Women cooked in the mill; shops were open on the street; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, so timber was very valuable.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on a journey farther west, Greenland was discovered and named Greenland.
Despite his discovery, however, the Eskimo tribes had already settled there by then.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have many differences in people, kings, customs, and history.
If you had seen the movie National Treasure, you might have thought that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a map of wealth.
Even if someone wrote on the back of the document, it was not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
While no one can be sure who actually wrote it, it is known that early in his life, a large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was hidden for storage.
Thus, the notation may have been added as simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles freed northern France, but not just the south.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for them rather than fight them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies occupied southern France, a conquest that became known as "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces had cleared southern France and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture that is shared by that vast mass of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and similarly describes the size of society.
A culture of civilization describes the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, a continuous cultural exchange and equitable distribution.
The greatness of the minor cultures disappeared without leaving a trace of history and failure to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government that Congress had composed itself under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacks any power to enforce taxes, and, having no executive or judicial authority, it relies on state authorities, which are largely unconventional, to carry out all its functions.
They still do not have the authority to regulate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the full consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states ignored the central government to the extent that their representatives were absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports became popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international and Olympic events.
Japan encompasses nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that comprise Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipel"
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when passing European explorers recorded the island's name as Formosa Island, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a revolution in the activities of native rice production and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and pipe plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it transferred control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Many of the buildings along the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they were like in the first place.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the closing years of the analog film era.
This is still done today, but its aspect ratio is more important than digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a confusing 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is thus said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are close to or approximate to this aspect ratio.
The grossly abused and misunderstood rule of thirds is a simple guide to creating dynamism while maintaining the measure of perfection in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the primary image is where the lines connecting the image to the third vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the states of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-powerful reach touched everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth will be used to alleviate hardship and poverty and that the church will spend money for that very reason.
The center of church authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years and that concentration of power and money has led to many questions as to whether this belief is being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a blockade of German waters.
The strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violates some generally accepted international law developed by some international intellectuals over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire sea section, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
With limited answers for this tactic, Germany expected a similar answer for its unarmed submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of the great populations and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his first job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different points of time; each Chinese state or ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
The most notable of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period that occurred over a 60-year period between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times fierce battles were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the grand palace of Xian.
Social and political effects have been numerous, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and willing to succeed.
The same is true of the military because instead of ranking by class, the ranks are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution has likewise inspired many other poor working-class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He regularly went to a cave that became known as Hira on Mount No (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knew of its existence, it would be difficult to find, and once inside the cave, complete isolation is possible.
All that is visible is the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains; very little of what is seen or heard in this world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures erected in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "up bow" mark is a V-shaped shape and the "down bow" mark is a staple or square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the end and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and raise the bow.
The up-bow makes a softer sound, while the down-bow is louder and more forceful.
Do not hesitate to paint your own marks, but remember that printed bow marks are for musical purposes, and they should be treated with great respect.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 years old Marie Therese and four years old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a disruptive group of women at the market.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open the window of their chariot wide.
On one occasion a member of the mob flagged off the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The costs of U.S. imperialism's war in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street bankers.
Of course, the huge profits from long-term exploitation of the Filipinos could fill the gap between the major beneficiaries of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars it was necessary to understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The age in which events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended in the 1500's.
Technological determinism is a term that carries the broad scope of concepts of function, from push-technology or necessary technology to the strict sense that human destiny is pushed under the logic of the law of the senses and their manifestation in technology.
Traditional interpretations of technological determinism follow two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology itself has effects on social characteristics, rather than social conditions.
For example, one might argue that the motor car must lead to improved roads.
However, the entire national network cannot survive economically on a few cars, since the new manufacturing process was designed to reduce the cost of ownership.
Car ownership led to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of a new treatment for body damage.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures associated with this geography developed, and these, unified in the sphere of society, prevailed against the invented platonic laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the underworld, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a hub of pride began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
His fortunes were boosted in the twelfth century by the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more expensive than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of the Capital of the World from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The style began to be heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, western style lingered for some 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to create its own style. One of the greatest achievements of the time was the use of buttons to fasten their clothes as a result of the crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is designed to produce food just enough to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, mostly organic, system that uses collected seeds native to the ecoregion mixed with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, farmers have been primarily engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures combine the same thinking as individuals who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of things.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and idioms.
One of the most common ways to show the importance of education is to take a few sad cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were cut off from adults as they grew up.
Some violent children are imprisoned by the community (especially by their own parents); in some cases this is child abandonment because of the parent's neglect of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Violent children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or on the run.
Some were thought to have been raised by animals; others were thought to have lived alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the aggressive child displays traits (within physical limits) that are almost identical to those of that particular caring animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based study makes studying easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a form of study but is a tool that supports individuals who are embarking on a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, i.e., the teacher is a form of scaffold but equally as small as the paperclip human-human in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in a software program and are designed to ask questions, interpret, and explain techniques that might be uncomfortable for the student to do on his own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many different reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to neglect.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that is uncaring, untrustworthy, and uneducating, but they are.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, reliable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care must be able to provide all the necessities that are lacking in the home where they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The peculiar nature of the internet has led to further escalation in terms of usage and techniques of giving pleasure.
For example, knowledge and communication have been suggested as important motivators for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal attachment and continuous relationship were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the reaction of website visitors.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the interpretation of small expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, points out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still understand sincerity accurately.
He even suggested that such a capacity to interpret human behavior might still be given to animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two classes of genetic variation: hidden and revealed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, which selection removes from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and repetition justify the repetitive variation between the two groups in each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino-acid requirements from extracted plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: slow growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant extracts are proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (chips, roots, and seeds) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high level of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that forest chimps do today.
Sleep apnea is a process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep time and falling asleep only once (1060 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent alarm clock to make you feel that you are not fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your bedroom, it may be moved to another part of the room, forcing you to work to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) and sleeping, which is forced by a sedentary act.
The amount of inner peace a person has is the opposite of the amount of tension a person has in body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive forces in life are available. Each person has the potential to find a peaceful, contented life.
The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is supplemented by the path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (light energy) is dissipated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of God. Through the visualization of various gods the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the perception of light is achieved.
Germany was a common adversary in World War II, spearheading the cooperation between the USSR and the U.S.A. After the war, the collapse of systems, processes and cultures led to the collapse of nations.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies had turned against each other and the Cold War had begun.
This would last for the next 40 years of actual warfare, with replacement troops, in the trenches from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were dashed overnight, as over 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way today to transport large quantities of people and goods across the seas.
The role of the navy traditionally is to ensure that your nation maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your adversary's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, in which the Americans tried to bring men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Britain might have been invaded by Germany just as the rest of Europe had been.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to kill them for the quick acquisition of milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Goats were often kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other pastures, often under the care of young shepherds, similar to the better-known shepherds, and this method of keeping is still used today.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although the wagons were made of the same wooden planks, they allowed the horses to beat them to achieve faster speeds and to push larger loads against the somewhat harder course of the previous era.
Crossties were introduced earlier to support local tracks, but it was gradually realized that tracks would be better off with a metal part on top.
This became common practice, but warfare caused even more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the past, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-steel railway was introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, which began two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (the standing man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, were unable to walk upright as they had been.
Bipedal specialization is evident in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can help environmental activists, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to eliminate them.
Clearly, human advances in science and technology have changed the world dramatically, and problems have been compounded by overpopulation and an excess of human life-style.
After this was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent several blocks away from John Dunlap's printing shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 The Dunlap broadsides is the oldest surviving copy of the document, and the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people did not think of them as dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
Yet, there are many aspects of birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They had legs with guns and knives, they were armed, and they walked on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information in the encoded form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, should be so general that a brief diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of indoor toxicity may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Look at the label for specific instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal term for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the familiar Sudlot, insects that are well-known parasites on man.
Both Assassin-bug and Sudlot are nidicolous, adapted to live in the host's nest or house.
Throughout the United States of America, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a neurological disorder of the younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In one adoption, the parents of the child withdraw their parental rights for the other spouse who may become the child's parent.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the universe came into existence in a scientific way, which has in fact guided most scientific research.
Although not isolated, an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations and still guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views have been adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge faded, the West found itself losing its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are largely dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue during the period of free-running cycling, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which DNA was marked on a phage with radioactive phosphorus or on a phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Mutations in the germ-line cells alone can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Mountain-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the sights, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and ecosystems.
One example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the organs of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplace and some find that the workplace is the same place they left.
This dynamic shuttle transportation, all seemingly connected, and supported, by a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science has now shown that the greatest economy of this carbon has removed the biosphere from one of the rigid states that have sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems.
In developing countries you rarely hear the same levels of complaints about water quality or bridges crumbling.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers incompetent, or is there something more?
Traffic Motion is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic behavior is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic behavior tends to have some reasonable similarities and can be mathematically presented.
To better represent traffic patterns, relationships are established between three key indicators: (1) pattern (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of street facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be transported by air, and their ability to fly enabled them to avoid enemies more quickly and to find food and mates more effectively.
Insects often have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back into their bodies.
This gives them more room in a small area to hide from their predators.
In ancient times, the only insects that did not fold their wings were the fly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Few people believe he is right but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, along with the Sun (and possibly other stars).
That makes sense, since it is inconceivable that the Earth is in motion, does it not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is still the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
The Amazon is responsible for 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The largest, the Amazon River, is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical sophistication of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egyptians was amazed at their earlier monuments, the older of which were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent nation in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its law and official communications.
Italian remains the everyday language of most civil servants while Latin is the most commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, since all of these are found in nature in their natural form and can be mined relatively easily with the latest tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he still theorized that these change into new elements to form what we see.
Alloy is usually a mixture of two or more metals, not to mention the many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
You can still have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter - all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the dot at the end of these words.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Sadly, as new writing techniques progressed, the pencil was moved to a shorter form and use.
People now text on a computer screen, no longer having to go near a computer monitor.
One can only imagine what a keyboard will be like when a newer one arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to power a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
As if driving a chariot up a mountain, the nucleus is reassembled and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that mean that they can easily decay with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and clay, the outer layer of which is called the crust.
The crust is nearly 70 km wide at the nearest point and 100 km wide at the farthest point.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the mountains.
There may be a nearby lava field because the crust is thinner, and the lava can easily rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what will attract people or what will attract them.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/ or desires that are applied while they are at the right age or maturity.
These theories see some people as having what makes them like the things they do and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In the overall story, both sides may emerge as managers begin to outperform their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the men" (or women).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people back.
At the other end of the spectrum, one may be an unknown individual who feels that he or she needs to change everything the group does and do it on their own.
After all, the leader is the one most responsible for the successes and failures of the group.
This practice often led to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are minor differences.
Members of a virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy against established team members because their team may meet in different time zones that their local manager may not understand.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a distinctive feature of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the governing body to which each member reports, setting standards for each member.
Why is an organization so eager to go through the time-consuming process of setting up an organization in learning? One purpose for training in organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in every productive department of an organization, creativity and wisdom can take place.
As a result, an organization's process of helping to overcome a difficulty may lead to a new, more refined process of providing what the customer needs.
Before an organization can flourish, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as the sharing of knowledge and wisdom in the organization.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive inquiry, thus narrowing the field of research and making it more accurate.
The connection between neurological pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that a wide variety of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Advances in new technology have allowed us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that were previously unseen.
This gives us a wealth of information to build simulations that can help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms one of the most important branches of computer science, involving behavior, cognition and intelligent adaptation to a machine.
Research in AI has included the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems have long been a mainstay in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they stand in some home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom, and a teacher often wants to take his students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual field trips, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Including a virtual field trip is still a good way to share a trip and experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital each year, the website is updated each year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience as a whole changes it.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to work on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be more aware of the world around them". The need to provide an audience with interest inspires students to be more aware and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and it encourages students to extend what is learned beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can give meaning to their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and is home to many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther south at Niagara Falls and further north is home to the unparalleled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more emphasize Ontario as what outsiders consider to be truly Canadian.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprised many: More African Americans live in the U.S. than in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and it is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the islets are independent nations, or dependencies of France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was adopted to a large extent in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wife: It is recommended that any woman who travels should say that they are married, whatever the actual state of marriage.
It can still be helpful to wear a ring (not just the expensive ones.
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment and unusual follow-up, arm-banging, and so forth.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to stand up (cultural differences or not, that won't be okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic outpost called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and gave it the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina it is easier to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tequila, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a full spectrum of geocaches, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the easternmost part of the country near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is still a safe area, any visits outside Goma are still to be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracks in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short trip.
Coupled with its relative unreachableness, "Timbukti" has come to be used as a metaphor for a strange, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a struggling town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger, because of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arabic versus African literature.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and lies just across the border from Mozambique to the north, with the Crocodile River as its northern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 diverse ecozones, each supporting a variety of wildlife.
It is a major attraction in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation and entrance fee for the park.
It may still be beneficial for one to purchase a Wild Card, which gives entry to any selection of South African parks or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and the place that tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glossy bar chart seen through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The great development of the Hong Kong Island province is part of the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the area that the British colonists took for their own and if you are looking for evidence of colonial passage through the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal plain in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested area within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just forests  they include some of the last remnants standing of the great forest that once dominated the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbands cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/crash area.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tiger ticks in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the crowds, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are usually crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get around nearby areas, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 232 feet [83 m], are 1,300 feet [378 m] long and have two lanes of 12 feet [3.50 m] in width.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres below the bridge, which was completed in August 2011, but not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important group of indigenous people living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic settlers still trained to make a living in agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by conquest, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of conquest that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has maintained many of its indigenous customs and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the most competitive teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year was held in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can still be seen here at other times of the year.
For news of the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklan pound (FKP) with a fixed value equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are still generally accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, even though British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to see what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland money outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, it is common for temperatures to rise to +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop in the cold, but air and moisture add up to make it colder against the thermometer's predictions.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife is also wild and should not be eaten or tampered with.
According to park authorities, bears or wolves are kept at a distance of at least 100 yards per meter and all other wildlife is kept at a distance of 25 yards per meter!
No matter how good they look, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all other large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting resulted in the assassination of the most important leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The three most popular beaches are the one that connects Auckland to the other.
The North Shore coast (in the North Harbour district) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is almost a sandy beach where it is safe to swim and is shaded by the many pine trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, just above the market towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
It is a family-friendly beach with many shops lining the beach.
The leading local beer is 'Number One', a non-sophisticated beer, but a delicious and refreshing one.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easily found if you are apprehensive.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee was foreign to Australians, with the shorter black being 'espresso', the capuccino being full of cream (not froth), and the tea being served without milk.
Hot chocolate is based on Belgian standards, and fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the falls are made throughout the year, and damage from any causes of the falls is rare.
Still, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to life-saving reminders.
Box jellyfish appear near the shores and near the river esters from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most shark-like creatures are afraid of humans and swim away.
The Saltwater Crocodile is an inactive marine life, with its main habitat in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to stay by the time they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have deals on specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages with breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even a combined flight and hotel package.
They can still hold the reservation for you if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests must first be made through the travel agent and not directly at the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp on the site, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you should get in early to get a campsite near the music.
Note that even after the music has been played in the main parts, some parts of the festival may continue to play until midnight.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, look for the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice will cause a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos often go to great lengths to save time and money, often without windows or clocks, and with difficulty finding the moves.
They often have special food, drink, and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood, and to keep them in place.
Similarly, alcohol impairs judgment, and all good drinkers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or beyond mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, the right amount of snow to hold you can fall in a matter of hours.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing fog or condensation or ice through the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, freezing conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey by land to see the beautiful wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are usually close to cars and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or going "footing") consists of hiking, which can be done over a period of hours or days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021 with some events being held at different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, hosting the men in 1964.
If you booked your flights for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in for a rough patch.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies had not been in place until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing close to ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a bed and an ironing board that can be used for ironing, even when no one is present in the room.
If you do not have a bracelet, or if you do not want to wear a plaster jacket, you may want to try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to become too hot (which may cause a burn, or in extreme cases, heat).
There are a variety of methods of water purification, some more effective against particular threats.
In some places, a minute's water is enough, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters have a wide range of effects, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water from a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit infections.
The infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death by force, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods free of duty and excise at certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on the highways of the land, your wisdom will remain with you: The steep steps, the narrow roads, and the steep curves will remain.
Speed limits are noticeably shorter against the front and rear - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/ h) - and strict adherence to them is more important against anything.
Surprisingly, though, mobile phone service is stronger here than on many other scenic routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather tasty, and in Bavaria, they are quite plentiful and varied, as is their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries, with apples cooked in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums showing during the summer are common.
Many German bakeries still offer almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you prefer a small but tasty pastry, try the so-called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on vegetables and spices, along with any meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "dry" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the Indian and Pakistani regions, yogurt is the most common curry; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, the peppermint is the most common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an expanded term that covers a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without additional qualifications, the term may imply that the dish originated in the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now widely spoken throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features simple dishes, the first spices known to the Javanese being peanuts, herbs, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The struts were the support for the rider's foot when riding under or alongside the saddle.
They provide more strength for the rider but may raise safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to squeeze on them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has one leg caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse runs further away. To minimize this risk, numerous safety precautions should be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, slightly short heel.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that give a leather bar a way to fall on the saddle if a fallen rider is thrown back.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with its diverse granite walls and cliffs.
Summits include breathtaking views from above, and visitors from all over the world continue to make new routes amid the endless potential of walls.
Low-snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many people taking part, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan a full holiday around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is ancient - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Low-level skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually not related to alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on rough terrain and requiring more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover a longer distance against walking -- but you rarely get the speed of cross country skiing with an unweighted backpack on good trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but is made up of many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means that you will have to go through many visa applications and passport controls many times.
The Schengen zone, however, seems to be a country worthy of it.
As long as you live in this zone, you can generally cross borders without re-entering passport control points.
