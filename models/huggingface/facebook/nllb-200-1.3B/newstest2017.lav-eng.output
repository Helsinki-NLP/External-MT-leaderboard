28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco supermarket.
This week, a 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the steps of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone who would want to hurt his brother, noting: "His life finally started to improve".
The body found outside a Westfield supermarket Wednesday has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a spokesman for the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
San Francisco police say her death has been ruled a homicide and an investigation is underway.
Upura's brother, Luis Galicia, tells San Francisco-based ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a security guard in Boston, but six months ago he landed his dream job at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were shocked and saddened to learn of his death.
"We are a small team working as a close-knit family and we will miss him very much", said the spokesman.
We are thinking of being with Frank's friends and family at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia relates that at first Frank stayed in hostels, but lately life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl", Lewis told KGO radio.
Luis Galicia claims he doesn't know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a big heart.
"He always helped his family by cooking delicious meals and preparing lunches", said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get into a fight.
He was the brother who adapted.
"For all the craziness in the world, he was like a rough diamond that sparkled every day", he says.

New doctors strike: call for new protests
Representatives of the new doctors are asking their unions to start a protest in a dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Young Physicians Committee (YCP) is set to ask the council to support wider protests in early September.
JAK considers that the Ministers have not succeeded in casting doubt on the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
The agreement was rejected by 58% of all members who voted.
In a tweet posted on Wednesday evening, JAK board member Ellen McCorta said the government remains silent on the issue and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said: 'In view of this, the JAK vote has resulted in the contract proposal being rejected in its entirety and a decision has been taken to request new formal talks to discuss more important issues.'
In response to the government's silence, the JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the drafting of a new contract, which would come into force in September.
The dispute led to six strikes by young doctors, including the first in the history of the NHS.
Following a vote rejecting the terms of the contract offered by LMA, which was recommended by the BMA, Dr Johans Malawana, representative of the new LMA doctors, resigned.
Before meeting the 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he told the BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that the contract would be awarded to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: The Alliance is Denied?
The gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to discuss and announce the end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at the St. Petersburg Palace, it was felt that Ankara needed this partnership more.
Yet, they both kept quiet.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked convoluted and did not express warm emotions, even considering his habitual demeanor.
Meanwhile, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has given Putin at least five times as his "dear friend", according to a briefing review.
I didn't get the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm is causing a contradiction.
But the rumors from Putin show that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the Russian plane crashed on the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted this time.
Putin accused Ankara of blowing up a bunker behind Moscow.
The infidelity was even more painful, considering that it came from a friend.
It will be very difficult, if not impossible, to regain true trust.
Since November, the public attitude in Russia has changed.
For months, government-controlled television broadcast aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame.
The most serious was the allegations that the Erdoğan family itself profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He denied it, of course.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting was that it was time to let go of the past.
In the end, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia might see it as some sort of victory.
The benefits to Ankara from the peace agreement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup attempt last month to assassinate him.
Countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, in particular the ban on charter flights, which normally provides an annual influx of several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts.
Tourist numbers have fallen by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights resume.
They're hoping to vacation safely in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
The national TV already predicts a decrease in fruit and vegetable prices this week as imports of fruit and vegetables from Turkey resume.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti put it: "Tours to them, tomatoes to us".
But there were other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Added to this is dissatisfaction with the protracted EU accession talks and the intervention of Putin, who is happy to take advantage of Turkey's isolation from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly gained extra points in Ankara's eyes by expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
You should note that Moscow understands this well, because it has a deep-seated fear of regime change in the country.
The summit at this quaint seaside castle gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present what one analyst called a "distant alliance", two nations that feel alienated from the West, joining forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreement is over Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite side.
After more than three hours of initial talks, both presidents, unwilling to disclose information, announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries can find common ground on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostilities and potential disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
Zimola SKB will continue to play a supporting role, the bank's CEO announced.
The GNI for Scotland outside the EU will no longer be available.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank was close to bankruptcy and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, trademark experts have used the SKB trademark to protect other consumer financial trademarks.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the Six Nations Rugby Union and ending with the Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided to put other national symbols in the foreground.
The Royal Banaka of Scotland will be available to customers in Scotland, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, other than the head office and the official list of exchanges, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also be in focus.
Mr. McEwan was interviewed on a trip to Invernessshire with clients and staff.
He told the BBC Scotland: 'SKB will become a brand for our investors and for our employees, because we are now more of a brand bank.'
In time, the bank became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these signs will represent something unique in their industry, and our people will work with clients under these signs.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and will engage in sports sponsorship of various brands.
'It is high time to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers,' says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to announce that we would be a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But by working hard and focusing on the needs of the customer rather than our own needs, we've obviously made a big difference.
We can revive these marks again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detory scored his 3,000th win, taking first place at Newmarket with the Predilection horse.
Detroit is cranking up champagne for its 3,000th win by finishing second in the first race at Newmarket.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Detory claimed his 3,000th win in British history by taking first place at Newmarket.
He achieved this by winning his second race in his hometown, riding a Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a feat in the sprinting events.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Adery and William Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who had previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special".
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that it was in Newmarket, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not Royal Ascot, this is a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I was relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have set the record in the hurdles, Richard Johnson, the reigning champion, and Sir Anthony McCoy, the 20-time defending champion, who has set several records in his career with more than 4,300 victories.
Lester Piggott, the ninth-time Derby winner, has 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the greatest comedians of our time, and it is no surprise that he has achieved a feat that is rare.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactics made him feel different from other jokers.
He's a fantastic storyteller, and his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago at the Epsom Race, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 races if he hadn't just been in the weekends and the big races.
But seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning races in the United Kingdom regularly for the past 30 years.
He's a life-long enthusiast who's a great fit for British racing, and he's a great joker.
Frank Dettor celebrated this achievement with his signature flying saucer.
From finishing in wind speed to flying a kite, Frankie Dettor has been the face of British horse racing for 20 years.
It's been an adventure.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 Grand Slam in Ascot, and he survived a plane crash and a drug disqualification.
Three years ago, he had a hard time coming back from a six-month suspension, but he showed the strength of his character by challenging those who doubted him by returning to his best form.
And he could be in the race for a while -- the Detroit Tigers have said before that they'd be happy to keep him in the race until he's at least 50.
Russian President Putin fires head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the inner circle of Putin's inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old politician has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration" without giving any reason.
Mr Ivanov was replaced by Mr Anton Vaino, who has been his Deputy since 2012.
44-year-old Vaino is a formidable diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
According to the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later headed the Presidential Protocol and Administration of Government Personnel.
After his inauguration, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust".
I think the main job of the administration is to support your work as president of the country, making laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian news outlet on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Does your smile convince you?
This step has shaken Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is a long-time and close associate of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked for the Soviet Security Service of the VDK.
In this capacity, he was one of the most powerful men in Russia.
In a hearing broadcast on state television, both men announced that Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, it's rarely convincing, especially before a parliamentary election.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows that.
However, the official claim that a man who was considered a possible president suddenly wanted to become the leader of Russia's environmental policy is met with great skepticism.
In comments posted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov tells Putin: "It is a fact that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult, I might even say problematic, job for four years.
It turns out I've been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service of the DPRK, like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, the successor to the DPRK, and Ivanov took over as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the Russian presidency, as Putin's re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin became president, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years, he returned to the presidency.
A small fish in a Banff garden
A man asks Banff for help in determining the circumstances of the fish species that appeared in his Banff garden.
Kevin Bean thinks the 75 fish could be sand lizards that have been transported by a water rod.
Mr. Bean, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the fish on the website Periscope, hoping that someone might know how this five-centimeter-long fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Junction: the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
The project, currently valued at RM1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern section of the Queensberry Junction to the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
The first of the four connecting sections is complete, which means that the bridge is nearing completion.
The construction of the Faifa Bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
The project, currently valued at RM1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Secretary of the Treasury Keith Brown arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the building of the Queensbury Bridge".
In this project, we see an unprecedented engineering solution, where more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel were used in the construction of this section alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, the connection of the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process requiring enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge's span has been completed and the final leg connecting the bridge to Rosita will be loaded today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for load.
Michael Martin, project director for the fourth bridge, says: "The first connection is a very important point in any bridge construction".
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the highest level of engineering.
After the final road section was installed and connected to the support of the north tower, we had to connect the north road section to the land section or viaduct.
This was done by scaring the northern approach part of the viaduct 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a huge operation, but at the same time a very delicate one.
The giant, 222 meters long viaduct weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be towed by about 3%.
Delicate, because the two-way radius the team was working with was only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, it all worked out.
Simone Bails wins gold in the women's gymnastics.
Forget the phrase.
Forget the stress.
Simon Bales doesn't seem to care.
Dynamic currents
The exercises are performed effortlessly on the beam.
Unbeatable on the floor.
Totally innocent.
And finally, an Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was a head-to-head over the result of the silver medalist and her teammates Aliya Raisman and the bronze medalist Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simona Bailsa performed the final round of the women's individual all-around at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bails became the fourth American to win the multi-sport championship and the fifth-best gymnast, gradually cementing his reputation as the best gymnast of his generation and perhaps the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, for the long journey to that moment was over.
This accomplishment put him alongside such unbeatable athletes as Michael Phelps, who took his sport to another level.
Bailsa has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing combinations of exercises so brilliant, precise and ambitious that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Reton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen".
In Brazil, she faced her final test, which was largely based on the expectations placed on her rather than on the other athletes.
She'd be disappointed if I went home to Spring, Texas without a gold medal.
U.S. athletes Simone Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane shine after winning gold and silver medals, respectively, in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bails won his first gold medal on Tuesday, throwing a farewell party for special teams coordinator Martha Carol.
While Bales claims that he never expected this on his long journey to fame, that is not true.
Some of her performances, including her distinctive acrobatic movements, are accompanied by Latin music that would fit nicely in the streets next to the Rio Olympic Stadium.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was a baby and discovered by coach Amy Boorman's mother on a trip to the gym where Boorman's games were held has become a force to be reckoned with.
She hasn't lost a pole vault since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak can go on as long as Bails wants.
Although Mustafina had a bit of a lead in the two rounds, it was only an illusion.
The balance ball and free-kick portion of the competition, where Bails will defend his championship title, is just ahead.
She took the lead with 15.433 on the ball and cemented the lead with 15.933 free throws
Raisman gently examined her as she waited for the results, which were only a formality, and she burst into tears of joy as the dream she had once recorded in her notebook came true.
Raisman's result was a slight reminder of the four-year-old event, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the bronze medal match.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, known to Americans as "Grandma", emerged as a convincing leader.
After a performance in free movements that raised doubts about her return, she could devote herself to the effort of air kissing.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old Bail's viral Twitter post, which she posted this week, has taken on a whole different meaning.
Six-year-old Mahai Brown, a "locked-in" survivor of a shooting in Philadelphia, is on the run.
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, making this the second 6-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the children have confirmed to CBS Philadelphia News that it's Mahy Brown.
Parents say Brown was shot multiple times, including in the torso, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, told television: "Her little body was just a bunch of sticks".
I can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
His family says he'll be fine.
He had to start first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are stable.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of a car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car, and police are investigating whether any of them were the gunmen.
An investigator told CBS Philadelphia that multiple shooters were likely involved in the shooting.
We found several gun cartridges at the scene, belonging to different weapons.
It looks like a long gunfight.
The two walkers had capsules on their sides.
"It looks like there were several gunmen involved in the shooting", said Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginald.
Several homes and cars were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly checking surveillance footage.
During the shooting Tuesday, a bullet went off in the hand of a six-year-old girl as she was playing outside her home in the Westukline neighborhood.
She's slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gabias, and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Swim Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been better.
Second, there are three track and field athletes on this team, Simone Bails, Gabi Douglas and Lauria Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that the team includes Alija Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic.
After all, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latino athletes in the sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabi were ranked first and second.
These are impressive results.
At the previous Olympics, Gabi Douglas had become the surprise Olympic champion, and America could shine.
Now the world has seen the incredible exercises of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unpredictable but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win the gold medal in women's individual all-around.
Her teammate Alija Raismane won the silver medal.
We have seen the best of the sport, but the rest of the country is a different story in terms of exercise.
Simone, Gabi and Laurie were selected for the Olympics, as were Ali and Madison.
They're called the "Olympic Squad", because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is coach Martha Carroll's last year as coach.
In fact, it is an expensive sport, with athletes trained primarily at private athletic clubs and supported by parents who pay for training, facilities, travel, uniforms, hotels (for coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in urban areas that can afford the sport.
These clubs are where athletes conduct all their training, and are an expensive and long-term investment for athletes' families.
The coaches of Amy Bourneman - Simone Bails and Maggie Heinija - Laurie Hernandez have been training their athletes since both girls started athletics.
We need to provide the young girls who are inspired by Simon, Gabi and Laurie with less expensive exercise training.
I started my athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organization is based in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Hispanic) free or low-cost physical training.We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch office in my hometown of Detroit, to provide local youths with an opportunity to experience this wonderful sport.
Athletics develops strength, agility, and body coordination, as well as hard work, discipline, and perseverance.
This combination guarantees a long life with good health and success at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics, and that's fantastic.
It is very important to participate in this sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simon, Aliya, Gabi and Madison for the amazing demonstration of Girls Power, winning gold medals at the Olympics and motivating countless young girls from diverse backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the junior doctors are planning to go on strike.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to a change in the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude the contract, stating that the NHS was in an unstable state and that further delays would only harm staff and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in the conditions for working night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, the BMA's representative for young doctors, Dr. Helen Makourt, announced that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will exacerbate the labour crisis and that it does not provide a level playing field for all doctors.
We're eight weeks away from the first group of new doctors signing a new contract, so we need to make progress, because there's not much time left.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the problems through negotiations have been met by the government's reluctance to intervene and in some cases by complete silence.
This is despite the fact that as recently as last month, Jeremy Hunt made the statement that his door is always open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, end the layoffs, and work with the new doctors.
If he doesn't, the young doctors are ready for another protest.
During the last strike in late April, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were delayed as nurses and counselors tried to replace doctors who had been on strike.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to a change in the contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the weekend rates for the 54 000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
The NHS's chief executive, Daniel Mortimer, has called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything but increase the pressure on the overworked workers and create stress and delay for patients, caregivers and their families.
We've been talking to the new medical committee for the last two months and we've been working with the Ministry of Health and other agencies to answer their questions about the informants and the informants positively.
Employers expect that active cooperation on other important issues such as placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, tuition fees and gender pay gaps in medicine - shows that employers, the NHS and the Department of Health are serious about the agreements reached with the BME in November, February and May.
Two doses a day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with 2 doses a day, as officials recommend that it be used in more people and for longer periods of time.
The anti-inflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a recurrent heart attack in people with heart disease.
These medicines are prescribed 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of a repeat heart attack.
The NHS representative, NICE, recommends that this medicinal product be used for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE, which is currently in charge of the NHS, recommends that this medication be used for four years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
Each year, about 140,000 people in England have a heart attack, and a quarter of them have a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the heart walls, forming blockages.
If the blockage spreads, it can cause a clot, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
If a blood clot separates from the blood vessel wall, it can travel further into the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca in the UK and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
New NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor twice daily for 12 months and another 3 years with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, director of health technology at NICE, explains: "Despite the availability of drugs to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will have another heart attack or stroke, often with serious consequences".
Fear of having a recurrent heart attack can have a negative effect on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of a recurrent heart attack and stroke in people who have already had one.
By recommending Ticagrelor provisionally, we are pleased to be able to extend the treatment to thousands of people who are thus benefiting.
Given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend its use beyond this period.
A culture of political correctness promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, the former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahman, was dismissed for corruption.
A government report reveals that a culture of political correctness is opening the eyes to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticizes the police, election officials and city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the election process because of "the fear of prejudicing ethnic and religious interests".
A former community secretary who has become the head of an anti-corruption organization says that religious intimidation of voters is so widespread that police should be allowed to station guards at polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He also suggests that voters should show their identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Now, all voters have to do is give their name and address.
He even suggests that the voters' fingers be marked with special ink to prevent double voting.
Sir Eric says that journalists also need to be given greater protection.
He believes that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraudulent elections but also to protect local governments from the broader culture of corruption and fraud that goes along with it".
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following the scandal surrounding the Town of Tauerhamlet's election.
Last year, a special election court decided to remove the city's mayor, Lutfur Rahman, from his post due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically eroded" the religious views of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman campaigned on the premise that it is the religious duty of believing Muslims to vote for him".
About 300 votes were falsified or questionable because the same person had voted multiple times.
Sir Eric also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He said that the fraudulent mail-in voting, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their favourite candidates, was particularly troubling.
Sir Eric suggested a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of identity documents to establish a person's identity.
Her report states: "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and youth, are being forced to vote for the most senior elected candidates of the community, especially in communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan".
"There is a concern that the local authorities will not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, which could undermine ethnic and religious interests".
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, including a ban on political activists working with mail-in ballots to prevent "vote-picking".
The report, which is being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough registration checks to prevent the use of voter rolls for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility of requiring voters to produce identity documents before voting.
To mark the fingers of voters with a special ink to prevent double voting.

Sir Eric Ashe criticises the Metropolitan Police, expressing his dismay that no charges have been brought in the Tower Hamlets case.
He relates: "The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud".
He was convicted conclusively by the standard of evidence in criminal law, based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the ineffective "checks" of City Hall voters at the polling stations.
"Last year's court decision is a wake-up call", says Eric.
Our country is known as the home of parliament, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the institutional pretence that fraud does not happen threatens this good reputation.
Bicycle Obsession - Kate's Companions and Other Companions of Rio Olympic Fame
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics were thrilled by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevoet, whom fans recognized as an extreme likeness of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete competing for gold this summer, and the media is reporting that she is bragging about her celebrity rival.
So in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces you see on our screens right now, FEMAIL has put together a list of Olympic athletes who are very much like Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. archer Brady Ellison, left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Aside from Keith's bike-racing counterpart, many people on the Internet suggest that this shooter may be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. men's arch-shooter Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter when he posted photos showing him looking very much like the Wolf of Wall Street.
The athlete himself noticed the storm on social media and acknowledged that he had been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much similarity except for the beard", Brady tells the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I take that as a compliment".
This year, there is no doubt that even more attention will be paid to one of the most popular pairs of London 2012 Olympic Games teammates: the striking similarity between British figure skater Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian actress Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been compared to Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
When it comes to swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to "Creature Scene" star Matthew Morrison for years.
Changes: this user has noticed that Nathan is the athletic version of the actor from the movie "Inception".
Also similar artists are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar faces and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova and actress Annaline McCord not only have sun-drenched skin and blonde hair, but fans also see the American athlete Nathan Adrian as a likeness to Joseph Gordon Levy.
Women in hair: The faces and eyes of soccer star Huppi Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) are similar.
Not one: a Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to find that others were seeing the similarities.
Theory: this user thinks there might be a reason why they look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user reported with great excitement that "other netizens were in agreement that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look the same".
The American football star and the "Dexter" actress really do have a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medalist gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts a beautiful, broad smile similar to that of "Bring It On" star Gabrielle Union.
A CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer "finished like a pig".
Byron McDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanha's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay has caused a firestorm in CBC viewers.
Canada's CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "flown out of the competition only to stink" and "end up like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he gave his personal opinion at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
McDonald, who was part of the CBC commentary team to give the commentary a bit of vibrancy, said: "That little 14-year-old girl from China can't keep up".
"She ran out of the race too early, "and she got so stinking, she ended up like a pig".
Thank you so much!
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana's time in the second round was 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds slower than that of Teodoro Ruck of Canada, allowing the Canadians to overtake China.
Viewers across Canada reacted instantly online, shocked by the tone and expressions.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC live commentator just say that 14 year old swimmers from China 'finished like pigs'????".
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.
Ai Yanha of China in the women's 4x200m freestyle final was called "the little 14-year-old from China who doesn't have a ride".
The criticism of Byron McDonald quickly took hold, as many demanded explanations.
Twitter users couldn't believe it when they heard the uncomfortable comments from Byron McDonald.
Twitter user Sarah Parady wrote: "Ooh, #ByronMacDonald. I'm not going to be the first person to say that.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like racists. #crazy.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was then the CBC's live anchor, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologize that the commentary on the swim score was played live".
It was a poor choice of words, and we're very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to the Twitter comment.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
The CBC then collected an apology from over 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly issued an apology and a statement.
We are deeply sorry that these comments were made and that they were aired live.
Yesterday, we reacted immediately and apologized to all our live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were made on the swimmer's performance and not addressed to her personally.
But in any case, those were unprofessional and poorly chosen phrases, and Byron deeply regrets what happened.
On Wednesday afternoon, McDonald apologized in person on live television and tried to explain that he did not think his comments would be taken as a personal attack.
On the CBC Olympic Live broadcast, he said, "I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for my comments yesterday after the women's freestyle competition".
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not her personally.
I don't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm really sorry that it happened.
Primark shoppers are shocked by a woman who shamelessly lingers in the middle of a lingerie store.
The shoppers were uncomfortable when a woman began to dress up to hang her pants in the middle of the store.
To make matters worse, she tossed them to make sure they would fit, and then she pulled out, putting them back in the shop's washbasin.
She continued to look for clothes at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone and ordered four more pants.
Primark Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone is where this woman pulled her underwear and then dropped it back in the wash.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, was at the store at the time, and she said that after a lingering lingerie, a woman she did not recognize put on her clothes and left the store without making a purchase.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took off her underwear, took off her jeans and pants, and measured them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just put them there.
Everyone was watching her take off her pants, and she obviously didn't like them, because she just put them back in her hair.
She weighed three more pants before deciding she didn't like any of them and leaving the store.
She did not seem to care if anyone looked or thought about someone who would buy the clothes she was wearing.
Davidson, a 33-year-old from Kent, says: "It's a thrill to think that someone will buy clothes that have been worn by someone else and then not worn".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I assume that the shop staff took the clothes out of the store's trash after she left", adds Mrs. Davidson, "which is reasonable".
I can't imagine buying new underwear and finding out that another woman has been wearing them and then not washing them.
A representative of Primark stated that Primark was aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August.
The specific clothes are taken from the store's hair.
How to Protect Yourself From Guns by Using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little bit safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves from assailants with a rifle at close range, we spoke with Ron Mizrahi, a Krav Maga grandmaster in New York City.
Whether you're being attacked from the front or from the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and get a head start on the attacker.
Mizrak points out that if an attacker attacks from the rear, then you must first turn around to clearly see the attacker and avoid his trajectory.
Then, the weapon must be held between the forearm and shoulder and the opponent must be struck in the face with his free elbow.
Then, while the assailant is in pain, take his weapon, strike him in the face with the blade of the weapon, and retreat, continuing to point the weapon at him.
If the assailant approaches from the front, the situation is similar - you must avoid the assailant's trajectory, lock the weapon, and position it so that the assailant cannot fire.
At the same time, press the weapon and press the opponent's chest, and finally, take the weapon away from him and retreat to continue aiming.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how Mizrakis do just that.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, it's safer to give your money back to the thief.
A Vandal family demolishes a social housing in Salt Corn and is thrown into the street.
A Vandal family has been evicted for terrorizing neighbors, causing damage to a social housing project worth 50,000 marks.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilcox, were banned from their property in Salt Lake City because of a number of complaints against them.
When they were forced out of the property, the housing authorities were shocked to find that the property had been completely demolished.
Holes were drilled in the floors and walls, garbage was dumped everywhere, and graffiti was painted on the walls.
The family is now off the property and probably living on some private property.
Donna Makevois, manager of Cornwall Housing Authority, says there are concerns that the housing will not be able to be restored.
She says that it was extremely difficult for people who lived here, and she feels that people cannot live like that.
In this case, several factors must be considered, as the property will not have a good reputation in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The others had three sons who periodically stayed on the property, and police say their terror manifested itself in violence, running around the streets with baseball bats, intimidating local residents, drug use, drug dealing, and loud banging and breaking.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, whose name was on the property, was sentenced in June for anti-social behaviour.
The rooms of several demolished houses contained discarded waste.
The house, where drugs may have been sold, also has several floors.
Neighbors say they regularly fought in the streets and constantly called the police.
Cornwall Housing Authority forced them out of the property after they had been given 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy to be saved, for their lives had been a complete waste.
One said, "They didn't care about other residents".
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
It's amazing how many times we've seen cops in here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet - we were not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, this place is gonna be great.
Adams Fitzpatrick, who is the head of neighbourhood protection at Cornwall Housing Authority, said the family had not been cooperating with local law enforcement.
The family has lived here for 20 years and the police are called here regularly.
Various old and unsuitable items were found in the garden of the house.
He added: "It is a pity that the Irish have not shown any responsibility for their behaviour, as eviction is always the last step taken by the Cornwall Housing Authority".
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and the neighbors had a hard time noticing their behavior.
I appreciate the work that my entire team, Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members have done in this case, who have been brave and cooperative in providing us with the information we need.
I hope this event will make life easier for the neighbors and show that antisocial behavior is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of his sons lived here at different times, but they were all in their early 20s.
A dirty mattress that was left on the floor in one of the rooms after it was removed.
The staff will now have to clean up a pile of trash left in the house.
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, pounds, appliances, and 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldone was only found guilty of possessing class B drugs with intent to distribute them.
She claimed that the money was intended as a memorial to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It turns out that they're renting a private property in Plymouth.
Many houses had graffiti on their walls.
Police say they'll continue to detain tenants who violate their lease.
Devon and Cornwall Police spokeswoman Angela Crowe said the move was a clear warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
She also said: "This is a warning to those who think they can do as they please and have no consequences".
Devon and Crownville Police have no tolerance for criminal and anti-social behaviour, and they will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The willingness to spend can give the economy a boost.
Akropolis LT, which manages the Acropolis shopping and entertainment centres in Vilnius, Klaipėda and Šaul, will be merged into the Acropolis Group, retaining all existing liabilities to Acropolis LT's partners and employees.
The merger of Akropolis LT and Akropolis Group is planned to be implemented by 1 October this year.
We are entering a new phase of development, during which we will implement large-scale projects, and we are therefore seeking to simplify the company structure, which will allow us to create a more efficient team of professionals within Akropolis LT and the Akropolis Group.
We are currently implementing the largest Acropolis development projects within the decade - the construction of the Acropolis multifunctional shopping centre in Riga and the development of a multifunctional facility in Vilnius, on the former site of the Velga Plant.
'The new company structure will allow the experience and expertise of the Akropolis LT team to be used more effectively in the successful development of projects and in the operational decision-making process,' admits Saule Zabulionytė, member of the Board of Directors of the Akropolis Group.
The Akropolis Group is a group of companies that manages real estate development, shopping centre rental and management companies in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Bulgaria.

The mayor of Cannes has banned burkin swimsuits from beaches.
The mayor of the southern French coastal city of Cannes has banned the wearing of burkini swimsuits on the city's beaches, which almost completely cover the woman's body and look very much like hydrotherapy, local officials said Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linares, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who does not have a swimming pool, which respects good manners and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"The wearing of clothing that reveals religious affiliation in a way that is not acceptable at a time when France and religious sites are the target of terrorist attacks, may pose a risk of disruption of public order (clashes, clashes, etc.) that needs to be prevented", says the order.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about the bizarre clothing that is associated with loyalty to the terrorist movements that are fighting us", explained Terii Migul, the head of municipal utilities.
He added that the burkin swimsuits had not been seen on Cannes beaches since July 28, when the right-wing center-right Republican Linares signed the order and it went into effect.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseille cancelled a private event for Muslim women wearing burkini swimsuits, after a wave of protests from both right-wing and left-wing politicians.
In France, the wearing of face-covering Muslim headgear is forbidden, but religious symbols or clothing are not.
On July 14, a terrorist attack in Nice, a port city near Cannes, claimed by the Islamic State group, killed 85 people.
On July 26, two gunmen who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State brutally attacked a priest in a church in northwestern France.
Last year, Jysk increased its turnover by 5%
The Commission notes that the Commission's assessment of the compatibility of the aid with the internal market is based on the information provided by the Icelandic authorities.
The company's turnover in 2014 was EUR 22,57 million.
The company's profit also increased slightly, from EUR 781 235 in 2014 to EUR 785 896 in the previous year.
The management report stated that last year the company reconstructed the existing stores in Riga, Slokas Street, and closed the stores in Riga, Kurzemes prospectus.
This year, as in previous years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
In the meantime, it is advisable to keep the profits from the purchase undivided.
Jysk is an international chain of stores offering home improvement products.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted in the form of a loan from the State to the Land of Thuringia.
The share capital of the company is EUR 3 500 264.
The company is owned by Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC, a company incorporated in Iceland.
I'm going to make the fried chicken fries simple, with a little white meat.
Eat them as soon as they're cooked, and they'll be the best.
Fish fillets and white meat are mixed together in a meat grinder.
The massage is made by adding milk, salt, pepper and then stirring or mixing again.
The butter, kept at room temperature, is then added to the dough and carefully mixed to form medium-sized cutlets.
The pancakes are then rolled into a bread roll.
The oil is heated in the pan.
The cutlets are placed in a pan and cooked for 10 to 15 minutes before eating until they are golden brown on both sides.
Serve while it is still warm, with a layer of minced butter or some other sauce.
The festival "Cuba" is opening in Lucassol.
On the evening of Thursday, August 11, one of the last festivals of the summer was kicked off in Lucca, where "Cuba" will be held until Sunday night.
The first night was filled with such bands as Enter Shikari from the United Kingdom, who had been expected to appear last year but had not made it onto the show, American punk band NOFX, DJ Maxim from The Prodigy, and others.
The following days' program will also feature the names "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", punk legend "Ramones" drummer Marky Ramone with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian punk leader Sergei Mihalok, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainian "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full program of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year that the festival "Cuba" is held in Latvia.
It had previously suffered financial failure and huge losses, but this did not deter the organizers from repeating the attempt - they added a long note to the name, included a Latvian group in the program (on Friday evening at 19:15 on the stage the song "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "closer and gained local coloring similar to the symbols of Riga such as its panorama and cats".
Whether this effort is justified is yet to be seen, for the festival is only a matter of time, but as Delphi Entertainment observed on the first night, at least for the time being, it has failed to attract the huge crowd and the number of visitors has remained the same as last year.
The British cycling team has twice improved the Olympic record and won the sprint.
The British track team on Thursday beat the Olympic record twice and won the men's sprint.
The first Olympic record was set by the British in qualifying, but it was broken by the New Zealanders in the first round.
In the sprint final, Great Britain faced New Zealand, and the British stripped the New Zealanders of their Olympic record, leaving them with silver medals.
In the final, the British team won by 42,440 seconds, beating the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the bronze medal match, the French team beat Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also improved in the women's qualifying race, with the British team improving the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
The president who stayed in the shadow: Gustav Zemgalan - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustav Zemgal.
Zemgals proclaimed Latvia a state, but has not earned the respect of the widely described first Latvian president, John Chastain, and the last president of the pre-war period, Carl Ulman.
No other national hero has been as strong a defender of democracy and the rule of law as Zemgal, writes Arnold Auzijn in a book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal published ten years ago.
In an interview with the Delfi portal, Auziņš points out that Zemgal is one of the few high-ranking politicians who has had a sense of humor.
The rest of the time, it's always right.
He was taught not to be, which today would be similar to what Raymond Weyven is.
"He was a man who was close to the people", says Aubrey.
Modern politicians know little of history, they refer to Carl Ulman as a leader of good, but few know how bad he was.
The only person in the cabinet he didn't yell at was General Balod.
Even though he's kind and smiling in the pictures, he was naturally hysterical.
"The land, with its sense of humour and democracy, gives the exact opposite impression", says Auziņš.
Professor of the Faculty of Literature and Philosophy of the University of Latvia Aivars Stranga agrees with Auzi's assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and quiet state.
He also notes that Zemgal is known for his respect for minorities, regularly inviting Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"It was not a common practice at the time, and it was taken over by Albert Quesay, the president of the Continent", says one historian.
He was such a quiet, self-absorbed man that he had to be talked into becoming president for a long time.
He didn't want to do it, he just didn't get the credit.
He also was quite critical of himself because he did not speak French, but he felt that the president must know it.
"He learned the basics of French during his presidency", explains Stranga.
Zemgall was not afraid to be asked to run again, he didn't like the position that was so high.
In any case, he is a very respectable figure in the history of Latvia, even before entering the presidential palace he was in a serious position - he was a very sought-after notary.
Zemgal also ran the famous Zemgal cashier in Suvorova Street 3, where the association of the scrappers and thefts was located, and in which the Latvian state became a part of the government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
He wasn't much of a fan of Ulman, but he didn't speak publicly either.
"In private conversations, it has been said that he does not really sympathize with Ulman's actions", Stranga says.
He lived a quiet life, no suspicions of lawlessness or corruption.
How is the underworld remembered today?
Unfortunately, most of his associations are with a street in Riga.
He was a true democrat, a centrist.
"There were no major shocks during his tenure, which meant he could be associated with a truly stable presidency", Strang summarizes.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, Latvia also made a state visit to Sweden, which indirectly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighbouring country and its inclusion in the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgal arrived in Stockholm for a state visit.
The visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second Latvian president was born in 1871, but died in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child deal with anger.
I often find that the parents view a child's display of anger and resentment as wrong and abnormal.
When a child expresses his anger openly, we do not know how to react, says psychologist Ekaterina Kess.
The specialist encourages a small discussion about these natural and human emotions - the anger and resentment that everyone experiences from time to time.
Aggression is a physical act directed at another person, and it usually occurs when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, upset, we usually know what's happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, suppress, conceal, keep, tell our friends or other relatives, blow up a couch in anger, smoke cigarettes (not the best way to calm our anger!), shower, put a head covering over our neck, and do other things we normally do not do.
We don't turn our aggression on others because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
When anger is felt, children do not know what is happening to them, what to call it, or how to deal with it.
They can say, "Get out!" You're a fool!" "You're a bad mother!" "I don't want to see you!" "I'm not going to deal with you!" And very rarely can they say, "I'm mad at you".
Children literally live, they are fully present right here, right now, they are spontaneous and real in their expression of feelings, and they are often also in the grip of various emotions.
It is vital that parents do not deny, shame, or reproach their children for expressing their feelings, including anger, but, on the contrary, help them.
Do you need a break in your relationship?
A long day at work when things don't go exactly as you'd like, or a bad mood - there are so many reasons to want to "lock out" for a moment, a day, or even longer.
Can we take a moment to look at relationships and take a breath?
Does this mean that each partner has his or her own path?
The opinions of gentlemen of different ages are divided.
John (23) is short and to the point: "If you need a break in a relationship, it's not with the right person".
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a pattern that may help someone.
If you feel that your mate is getting on your nerves about every little detail, then surely this is the time to explore other areas to see if you miss her or do not think much of her or even want to see her again.
So the answer is, yes, pausing can help you save time and realize how important the other side is to you.
Caspar (29) reveals his theory.
I think that relationships need to take a break from each other every day, because when you're with someone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then arguments are inevitable.
It's caused by you noticing every little thing the other person does, and it starts to get on your nerves.
People start to hate each other, especially when there's nothing left to talk about but what you did that day.
My personal experience suggests that, which is why I haven't had a relationship for more than a few months.
If you ever think that somewhere else or with someone else is better, then why does this woman you're with deserve someone who can think that it's not good enough and that beyond the mountains are fields of paradise?
Thinking is a little treachery.
If not, then not.
"I have, so I'm a little bit judgmental about those who don't", says Edmunds, 46.
Karl (33) has almost the opposite view.
I think everyone needs a break.
You can't look each other in the eye every moment, all the time, from morning to night, and gloat about undying love.
Get back! Get back! Get back! What are you doing?
There's so many things - friends, work, parties.
There's a time for everything.
Of course, so does a girlfriend or a wife, but if both manage to maintain their balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live on to the grave.
That's it.
Says Martin, 27, "It's hard to say whether you should or shouldn't, whether you should or shouldn't take a break, but one thing is clear: There is something missing from the relationship".
If this question is asked, then it is up to you to calculate whether there will be any changes in the near future, for better or for worse.
I mean, as long as you're young and crazy, you need a break, like, all the time, but when things get serious and the relationship goes into a whole new phase, then there's no such thing as a break.
You're going to spend the rest of your life together!
"If you can't stand each other's company now and need to get some air once in a while, what about when you're retired and you're talking about how cats bark or arguing about which day to clean the garden?" explains Christaps (19).
All the Lord's words have been changed.
With his emotional and exciting personality, Rozentál was the first to arouse the Latvian people's interest in the visual arts.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable", wrote Roman Suta about the Latvian master of painting Jani Rozental.
Also in 2016, when the grandmaster's extensive retrospective exhibition was opened in the main building of the Latvian National Art Museum, it is clear that Rozentál is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but has been open to the public since 13 August and will run until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with a large retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall pays tribute to the painter Jani Rozentál (1866-1916), whose 150th birthday is included in the UNESCO calendar of celebrations.
The retrospective exhibition, which will showcase more than 150 works, is one of the highlights of the annual programme for the Jubilee of Jan Rosenthal.
The selection of artworks is mostly made up of the collection of the Latvian National Art Museum, which convincingly represent the main phases and genres of classical creative activity, stylistic changes and the diversity of techniques.
Additional exhibits from the Akseli Gallen-Kallelas Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Museum of Liège, the Museum of Tukum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland were used.
The light of the centenary is revived by the presence of a photo image, and the exhibition's mobile application reveals links between individual works of art and photographs taken by the artist himself with his camera for the needs of the younger generation.
The Finnish-Latvian association "Rozentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classical artist, is offering the first exhibition of a small informative traveling exhibition "With a Look in Finland, with a Heart in Latvia" at the National Art Museum of Latvia.
A similar exhibition with a presentation in English, Swedish and Swedish will open in the autumn at the Virka Gallery in Helsinki.
Matt Leblanc is looking forward to returning to Top Gear.
TopGear host Matt Leblanc has said he is looking forward to returning to the car show for season two, but admits he doesn't know what the future holds.
Nothing's official yet.
"If there is, they will tell the BBC", Leblanc revealed in an interview with television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gas on the Floor!" arose in July when Leblanc's manager Chris Evans announced he was leaving the show.
After the departure, Evans admitted that Leblanc and "Gas in the Floor!" were "just right for each other".
Evans describes the former Friends star as a "real and decent man", thus raising the speculation that the two's friendship had died during filming.
When asked what he liked best about the show, Leblanc said that he liked to travel to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC reports that there are no plans to replace Evans in the new 24th season.

Meldonium in the drug Mildronat, produced in Latvia, could be excluded from the list of substances banned by athletes this year, said Ivars Kalvinš, director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, on Friday morning's LNT programme 900 seconds.
He said he would travel to Canada in September to discuss the meldonium issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist hopes that Mildron will be removed from the "black list" this year.
Two cyclists were taken to hospital after a collision.
Two cyclists were involved in a collision in Siguld, Switzerland, with multiple injuries, according to the state police.
The accident involved two men, born in 1987 and 1990, who were both admitted to a medical facility.
A cyclist also fell in Koknes.
A man born in 1989 has been taken to the hospital.
A motorcyclist born in 1989 in the town of Dobel, in the province of Nauvoo, tried to avoid a dog that had run off into the road and crashed.
He's in the hospital, too.
On the previous night, 71 road accidents were recorded in Latvia, with 16 people injured.

However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
Behind the scenes of the American modeling business, his performance won him the glamour of perverted shredded photo shoots and the impatience of horror movies.
In essence, a very provocative work, balancing the exaggeration and the banal vulgarity, which makes it difficult to draw the line between the European art house film and the territory of the Hollywood genre product.
Starring Viggo Mortensen, the film focuses on the question of whether the conceptual lifestyles of parents (ecology, vegetarianism, alternative life and a departure from the stupidity and values of the consumer society) are a blessing or a destructive one for their children.
An idealistic father of six is confronted with questions about the correctness of his choices and his true values after the death of his wife.

Of course, the shark does this as an attack on the good ones -- in the Joker, it was a swimmer, in this case, a brave surfer, portrayed by Blake Lively.
The job demanded her basic heroism.
This survival rate is comparable to James Franco's acting performance in 127 Hours and Ryan Reynolds' performance in The Sea Is Alive.
Perhaps the main character Mila Kunis is also to blame, for her transformation from a model mother to a creative perpetuator and a near-mocker of family values seems to be merely the product of the fantasies of a desperate Hollywood screenwriter.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Fighters from the Islamic State group fleeing Menbij in Syria's Aleppo province have taken hostage some 2,000 civilians who are being used as live slaves, the US-backed Kurdish-Arab Alliance and Observers said on Friday.
"We did not shoot them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerabulus", a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij military council said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbij had been liberated from the jihadists.
Menbij was captured by the Islamic State in 2014.
QSD killed most of the Islamic State fighters from Menbij last week, but some have held out and resisted.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking prisoners with them.
The Islamists are heading for Jeraboulou, which is on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that ISIS had abducted some 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that the Islamists had hijacked the cars of the townspeople, forced people to get into them, and then took them to Jerabulus.
Islamic State militants have carried out mass abductions in the past.
In January, Islamists captured areas in Deir ez-Zor province in eastern Syria and abducted more than 400 civilians, including women and children.
Later, the Islamists freed about 270 of the captives.
It is not known how many Islamic State fighters fled Menbij.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij Military Council reported that the QSD had managed to rescue 2,500 people held hostage by the Islamists in Menbij.
The SOHR has compiled information indicating that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have been killed in the fighting over the Menbij.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists killed.
Kolegaova withdrew her candidacy for the post of Director of the VIS.
The Director of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegava, decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the Latvian Agency for Economic Cooperation and Development (LETA) informed the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegava points out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the tension between the parties of the ruling coalition.
It seems that the real reasons for the debate are related to the visible, but more often, invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with my assessment of professional competence.
"I don't think that's acceptable either", says the former candidate for the post of EU President.
If her candidacy were to be confirmed by the government, it would be clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the EU to fully operate and implement the necessary changes with the full support of the government.
Without it, the full-scale work would not be possible, concludes Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly stated publicly that I do not want to be politically independent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is overly politicized", the official explains.
"Thank you for the trust and support you have shown me, it is an experience that I consider to be an advantage", Kolegova wrote in her application to Reznets-Ozolai.
The unit revealed on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegav, 'substantial discrepancies' were revealed between the candidate's explanations and the information available in the public registers on the dividend costs of SIA Pallogue, as publicly available decisions of the Pallogue members' meetings provide for no profit sharing.
The current Head of the EUSR is Deputy Director-General Dace Pelékka.
The Latvian police are involved in the rescue of two small children who were left without supervision, the Latgale Regional Department of the National Police informs.
A report of unattended cats with babies was received at about 7:00 a.m. on Friday.
They were found in Lebanon near a former department store.
Both girls were immediately turned over to medical help.
A briefcase of documents and a mobile phone were also left in the car.
In less than half an hour, the guards tracked down the parents and went to the scene.
When police arrived at the home of the woman, they found her asleep, under the influence of alcohol.
According to initial information, the night before, a woman born in 1992 approached a friend, where she was drinking.
On the way home from the meal, the woman decided to leave the children at the store under unexplained circumstances.
The police immediately informed the nursing home, which will also decide the child's fate in the future.
The Riga Freeport has submitted all the recommendations of the VC on the Crimean Island project.
The management of the Riga airport has introduced all of the five recommendations of the State Control (VK) regarding the project Infrastructure development on the island of Krievius for the transfer of port activities from the city center implementation, the Diena.lv portal informed the company.
The approval of the project was planned at the next meeting of the Board of the Riga Freeport.
In order to implement the recommendations in line with the opinion of the VC, the management of Riga Airport also followed the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte under the management of Riga Airport and the recommendations made for improving the project management in the subsequent phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations was also sent to the HR today.
Although the management of the Riga Freeport does not agree with the opinion of the VK on the feasibility of implementing the Crimean Island project, we are very responsible towards the implementation of the project and the European Commission (EC) as the funding provider.
I would like to stress that all the construction works planned under the project have been fully completed within the deadlines and the planned volume.
"To demonstrate to all involved in the project, including the EC, the VC and also the stewards, that the main objective of the resort is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the VC recommendations on project management and monitoring issues", says Sanita Kaire, the project manager of the Crimean Island.
The existing long-term operational plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project objective was supplemented by definitions of the main activities planned by the parties concerned and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, instruments for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as definitions of the main milestones.
The approved action plan for achieving the project objective by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the HR, is complemented by performance monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the timing control of the activities of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the Riga Freeport.
To improve project management and mitigate potential risks, a project management plan has been re-developed, defining the areas of project management and specifying the documents developed to provide control and monitoring mechanisms for each of them.
A project management structure framework has been developed to increase the project capacity, reflecting the structure of the planned project management team, the qualifications and functions of the staff.
In order to improve the communication between the Riga Freeport Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed for the project stakeholders, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the principles, types and periodicity of the exchange of information between the stakeholders for the successful completion of the project.
In order to improve the control of the use of funds, further details will need to be provided on the need to conclude or initiate a service contract and on the legality of the procedure.
The project has built world-class port infrastructure on the island of Krievius, including four new deep-water docks, railway lines and engineering communications.
The buildings co-financed by the Cohesion Fund were completed and put into operation in late last year, resulting in savings of EUR 10,6 million in funding.
Security at airports in Slovakia has been increased due to the threat.
Following non-specific threats, Slovakia on Friday stepped up security at several airports, the Ministry of Interior announced.
"In view of the threats, we have increased security at the international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice", a spokesman for the Slovak Interior Ministry told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analyzing the information we have received", he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will be held in the Slovak capital on 16 September, with the participation of all the countries of the bloc except the United Kingdom.
The event will discuss the consequences of the UK Brexit referendum and the future of the EU without the UK.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers are debating the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
A new study suggests that the death toll at the former East Germany border in the Communist zone may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts remain about the true number of victims.
According to data released Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum at Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 the West German Communist authorities abducted 1,841 people at the border with the Western Socialist Zone and later the West German Communist authorities who tried to escape from the territory they controlled.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years, and it's adjusting the death toll every now and then.
This year, 11 more deaths have been reported, including a six-year-old boy who drowned while his family was trying to reach West Germany through what was then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall were Soviet army deserters.
"The full extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented", admits museum director Alexandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to flee from a Communist-controlled state are collected and preserved", emphasized Hildebrandt in a statement circulated by the newspaper.
However, other researchers have questioned the new figures.
"The number 1841 is inconclusive", says Johannes Staat, an expert on East German history at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have only been able to confirm 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that 138 people were killed by the Communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
Given the number of people who have died trying to escape across the Baltic Sea or to reach the West through neighbouring territories, the State estimates the number of victims could be as high as 1,000.
But it's still significantly less than 1841.
One reason for the different casualty numbers could be due to different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all suicides of East Germany border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records deaths that are not directly related to violence.
"If seniors in their 70s and 80s die of heart attacks after crossing the border", Hildebrante says, "it must be the result of this 'cold border'.
However, the State is convinced that a distinction must be made between the elderly who may have died as a result of their experience of wandering and those whose deaths were caused by prolonged waiting in the hot hours on a bus at the border.
Regardless, it is not easy to count the victims, since the Communist authorities in East-Hungary did not record such statistics, and researchers have to dig up documents in various scattered archives, the State says.
However, the State Group has recently acquired new documents and may therefore issue a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
The LPF president Pone is going to Rio with a coach accreditation; he is surprised.
Recently, the infamous Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) president Kaspar Pone arrived at the Rio Olympics with a trainer's accreditation, but he feels surprised by it.
The public outcry on Wednesday came after German Jakubovsky, the coach of Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakov, revealed that at the last minute, Pone decided to go to Rio de Janeiro while the coach had to stay home.
The initial list of confirmed riders included swimmers Alona Ribakov and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovski and Dave Collins, as well as the federation's president, Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation has nominated five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before the flight Aldón Vrubljevski claimed that Germans will be there and he is looking for tickets.
"But obviously for objective reasons he didn't", Pone said, expressing the opinion that it didn't affect Ribakov's score.
Uvia's coach offered to help her at the request of the Federation.
Mr Pone, who is himself a member of the Executive Committee of the Olympic Committee, was particularly critical of the activities of the Olympic Committee, blaming the organisation that oversees the Olympic sport.
I think it's unethical for the LAC executive committee to approve five people and not bring any of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't get the seats", Pone said, pointing out that the federations and their presidents' work had not been appreciated by the public, noting that the presidents of the federations do not receive a salary.
Pone also criticised Jakubovski himself, pointing out that before the London Olympics, when Ribakov was not confirmed among the participants, he complained to the International Federation of Aquatics (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
The boss couldn't explain why he's in the Olympics with a coaching credential that was probably going to be given to Jakubovsky.
"I was signed as a team leader, but for some reason I got the coaching accreditation and now I'm not going anywhere".
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment, I thought the Germans would be there, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to LETA, a few days before Ribakov's start, she had a face-to-face conversation with Poni and after the swimmer had tears in her eyes, but the LPF president himself revealed that it was an everyday conversation with the desire to cheer up the athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF supervises five sports in the Olympic programme, four of which also provide training for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation pointed out that the issues of repression are also very important in Latvia and he also spoke about such programs while staying in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and expressed that the World Cup stage could be held in Latvia in 2018.
I'm not here on vacation, I'm here working, spending my time, trying to implement a four-year program.
600,000 baby salmon will be released into the river.
The launch of salmon and halibut calves in the fisheries recovery programme of AS Latvenergo is taking place this week in Davao, near Mangalas, and this year it is planned to launch more than 600 000 one-year-old salmon and halibut calves from the Bior Tomes and Dolé fish farms of the Scientific Institute.
Latvia informed the Latvian Energy Agency that the fisheries will continue to be introduced in the coming months, with a total of 6 300 000 young fish and carp of different species being introduced into the waters of the Danube basin each year.
The spring and early summer 2016 will see the release of the lark and the nectar, the seeds in June, the spring salmon in July, the sander and the wimps in August and September.
In the light of the above, the Commission concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
'Every action in the conservation and reproduction of fish resources is directed towards environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the Bior scientific institute, both in the breeding and introduction of fish in the Danube basin and in other activities,' said Kunicki.
This year, more than 600,000 one-year-old salmon and buffalo calves will be introduced into the Daugava basin.
For the second year, the young fish are marked by a fat strip before being introduced.
Today, the cargo holds 25,000 young salmon, with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, the scientifically substantiated species composition and numbers of fish in the Danube and its basin waters are introduced to the fisher-fisher population.
The fisheries resources in the Danube and its basin are reproduced by Bior in accordance with the regulations, based on the expertise of the losses to fisheries resources caused by the economic activities of Latvenergo and providing a conclusion on what compensatory measures can be taken to ensure the diversity of fisheries resources.
The State Environmental Service, on the basis of the expertise, decides on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual compensation for Latvenergo under the fisheries recovery programme shall be EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, in cooperation with the association "Mex for Fish", Latvenergo set up 400 artificial fish hatchery nests in Davao near Kaibal and Ikspiele for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the Association in promoting the natural heritage of fish is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo under the Fish Resource Recovery Programme.
The placement of artificial fish nests in the aquarium is an important measure to promote the conservation and reproduction of fish resources in the Danube.
The Sansusī Festival Concert Hall is a country courtyard, a forest, a meadow.
Sleeping in a tent, eating like a restaurant, walking around and listening to researched chamber music while enjoying the quiet nature - these are the combinations offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansouci, which is inviting visitors to Akniste district for the third summer.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of a former farmhouse in Susie, a village that no longer exists, and in the nearby woods and grasslands.
For three days, from 12 to 14 August, the five stages combine the carefree enjoyment of nature with the exquisite music of academia.
Here music meets theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its more recent forms, find new audiences in a free and open environment without the constraints of concert halls.
It is about 90 miles [150 km] from here to Riga, but it is only a few minutes' walk to a smile on your face and a lightness of breath.
"Please do not ask for the program, because we deliberately chose not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to a particular event or artist, because the true taste of Sansusi can only be determined by spending all three days there", invites the festival's initiator and host, the opera baritone Armand Siliņš.
The festival opens its doors on Friday at 5 p.m. and the first concert is at 7 p.m.
Of course, there will be software on the ground with all the information.
For those who need to choose a day, we recommend Saturday, since it is the busiest time of the day - from 9:00 a.m. to the next day.
"The names of the candidates are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armand Siliņš.
The beautiful artists' bouquet includes, for example, the violinist Eva Binder, the cellist Kristina Blaumane, the opera star Inga Kalna, the clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, the trumpeter Jānis Porietis, the pianist Reinis Zariņš, the quartets Quadra and RIX and even the Icelandic air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Erik Kirschfeld, Martin Zilbert and actress Anci Straddu created the contemporary circus performance Confines about the inner struggle of the artist.
Special events for young people were also organised.
The children will be shown "Kukinis", which according to F. Kafka, composed by Olėsija Kozlovska and Jakub Neimanis, along with Armand Silinis, musicians and actors, will be attended by the entomologist (chicken researcher) Ugi Piterāns.
Oskar Herliņš wrote the first String Quartet, while Anna Kyrse - The Cook's Opera, performances whose main characters in the direction of Andra Kalnozo with video projections by Katrin Neiburg and scenography by Andra Eglis will be three small trees in a three-hectare square of woodland.
Sung by Lady Gaga, Dinara the Red and Sigmar Grah, they will be romantically involved, much like the Enlightenment Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his study of the Cock Marriage (1729).
The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are starting today with one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation, the seven-man athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa will start the 100 metre hurdles at 15.35 Latvian time, and the high jump at 16.50.
The first round of the 200-meter sprint will begin at 2:35 p.m. on Saturday.
The sevens will conclude on Saturday with the long jump, the javelin throw, and the 800-meter run.
Before the Olympics, Ikauniece-Admidi, who won bronze at the World Championships last year, was mentioned as an Olympic medal contender.
In May, the Latvian set a new national record (6622 points) and finished second in the prestigious seven-man event in the Austrian city of Gæsa.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, where she finished ninth with a repeat of the Latvian record.
In the last year and a half, she has broken the national record four times.
Today, at 16:00, Latvian judo boxer Artura Nikiforenko will start in the 100 kg weight category, with the first match against Azerbaijan's Ushangi Kukauri.
For Judy, this will be the first Olympic Games of her career.
Latvian judo fighter Yevgeny Borodavko lost his weight in his first fight on Thursday in the weight category of up to 100 kilograms, LETA has already reported.
He was followed by the Japanese Hagu Ryunoski, who went on to win the bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolod Zeļoni brought Latvia the Olympic bronze medal, but in the next four Olympic games Latvian judoka in seven fights won only one victory, which was achieved in London by Borodavko.
At 16.30 p.m. the Latvian time qualification competition will start with the shooting of the stand by Dainis Upelnieks, but the selection will end on Saturday.
Upelník received the Olympic tickets only on the day when the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later revealed to LETA that he had been quite confident about the trip since April.
The athlete arrived at the Olympic venue as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities at the shooting competition.
Plkst.19.05 after Latvia time will be the Olympic Games debutant 17-year-old Latvian magician Ketija Birzule, who has experienced in the magic of the swords in the RS:X class.
After three days or nine races, Birzule is now ranked 25th in the overall ranking among 26 athletes.
The final medal round will be held on Saturday.
Today, the competition is finally scheduled for the academic airing, with the participation of the Latvian representative of Ireland, Sanita Pushpura.
Wednesday's race was cancelled due to inclement weather.
The Pushpurs will compete at 7:10 p.m. in the C/D semifinals of the women's singles to fight for 13th place at the Olympics.
In the second quarter-final, she finished fourth, from third, to continue the medal battle, 0.65 seconds behind.
Pushpure finished 13th in London four years ago, when he also represented Ireland.
Today's Olympics will feature 24 medals in archery, athletics, track cycling, jumping, diving, trampolining, judo, academic airing, shooting, swimming, tennis, and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected to the presidency, she will appoint Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid is confident that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merrick Garland for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's nomination since March, when President Obama nominated him.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the next president will be chosen to replace current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
During his conference call on Thursday, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reed's spokesman later announced that he had not spoken to Clinton personally about the matter and that it was all speculation.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to "screw the ship" with another option.
Garlands is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid has said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "evil" and acting in the best interests of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not fit to be president.
The Treaty announces a calendar for nude photographs for women and men.
Treat magazine will partner with photographer David Belmayer to create a 2017 calendar in the style of Pirelli's 1970s.
The 2017 UN Muse calendar is set to showcase new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
Earlier this year, Treats magazine president Steve Shaw announced that his erotic arts magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
It seems he's talking about the calendar, too.
In a press release on the calendar's creation, Shaw said: "We must return to the unfathomable and classic depiction of nudity, where the female body is not stimulated but inspires both women and men".
Women will want to participate in this project because it's a great work of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person to boxing sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
A shopkeeper in a garage is testing his motorcycle and stops.
On August 10th, at 10am, an unregistered Yamaha YZ250 was stolen from a house in Rembat, according to the state police.
The owner of the motorcycle had tried to sell the tract through the witnessing work.
At the appointed time, a potential buyer arrived, got on the motorcycle as if it were a custom bike, and left.
The staff of the Ogre Police Station of the Riga Regional Police Department are asking for the recall of anyone who can provide any information relevant to the investigation in connection with the criminal offence.
Please call 65002403 (during business hours) or 65002400 (all day).

The Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, a fish researcher, says that the record-breaking long-lived female may have lived to be 272 to 512 years old and 5 meters long.
A French court has rejected a request to tear down the shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
A French court has rejected a request by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to several thousand refugees.
At a court hearing in Calais this week, the authorities said the state should demolish 72 self-made shops where people sell various goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing, 50 cents (40p) tea and simple meals for a few euros in self-made restaurants.
The prefect's office in Kalua stated that these self-created enterprises should be demolished because they constitute a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as pose fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small enterprises are important because the food supplied by the government and the support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of inhabitants continues to grow.
They also pointed out that home-made shops and restaurants often offer free accommodation and food to those who need it most.
The Lille Court has ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have set up 72 self-made shops, but that understands the concerns of the prefect of Calais.
Justice Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee, and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people living in "extremely poor conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of being displaced is the camp's café, Jungle Book Kids, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French classes, and provides asylum counseling to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's coffee shop.
A letter to the Guardian said that the closure of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
On Friday, two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants, reported that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to 9,000, the highest since the summer's influx of migrants.
Great Britain wins silver in the Rugby 7 series, with Fiji's national team masterfully winning gold.
The impressive performance of the British national team in the Rugby 7 series came to an end on Thursday when they were conclusively beaten 43-7 by Fiji in the thrilling final at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.
Fiji demonstrated its mastery in bomb handling, ball-playing, supporting play, and brute-force play, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The fight brought a respectable consolation prize, a silver medal, which was Britain's third medal at the time. Britain's selection can boast of its success in the first Olympic Rugby Sevens tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The heavy semi-final battle, in which Box suffered a 7-5 defeat in the first half, was likely to be a draw for Great Britain in the final.
But in any case, Fiji's selection is in its best form to win the 15-man squad.
Little-known, but certainly comforting to the British, is the fact that at least one Briton has won a gold medal, and that is head coach Ben Ryan of Fiji, the former England coach at Wimbledon.
For Britain, it was an exciting adventure.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Rugby 7 series in Adelaide.
This time they only lost one game.
Death is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji had a spectacular start to the game, evading the tactics of British power for the fun of it.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like a collision with several buses on the opposite side of the road, and the World Series champions were leading 5-0, when Osea Collinisai got the first touchdown.
In the final four minutes, Jerry Tway added to his lead by landing on the right wing.
The score was 12:0 and the British team hadn't even really touched the ball.
Michel's powerful technique prevented the usual Leon Nakarava from scoring three points, but it had little effect on Fiji's result.
In the seventh minute of the game, Yasa Veremalua scored on a right-handed pitch, cementing the lead over Great Britain to 17 to 0.
After the game, Nakarava increased the lead even further and there was more than a minute left in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some ineffective British force tactics and crossed the line scoring points.
The score was 29 to 0.
It seemed Fiji was born to play rugby sevens while the British were still learning.
In fact, that is true.
The British team made a fundamental change in the half, crossing the Fiji line... for a full four minutes, which was good by first-half standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team performance, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing on the left-hand corner and making the score 36 to 7, but the game was already lost as the South Islanders' fans sang, waved their flags and danced in the stands.
Fiji's life-giving spirit is not without reason.
Mata Williams made Fiji's win even colder with another touchdown at the end of the game.
The final game was played with the bat, and Fiji could celebrate, but the British could only sit on their laurels after the massacre.
In the first half of the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where the two teams battled hard on the ground, with South Africa only a few points behind.
Kyle Brown led the Box in the first half, but in the second half, Dan Norton, with his brilliant skill, crossed the line and passed the ball between the stables, securing the British victory.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony, a member of the England rugby sevens team, used a powerful technique at the end of the game to secure the team's victory and another silver medal.
The coach's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win air races.
It's going to be the most emotional gold medal in this competition, and that says a lot.
From the first to the last, the golden moment of Helen Glover and Heather Stanning was of particular importance on the Estacio da Lagoa route.
Although only two athletes were on board, they were accompanied by the support of Robin Williams, who inspired them to win their second Olympic gold medal in the women's pair event, becoming the first women in British sporting history to achieve such a feat.
They were undoubtedly dominant, for the 39th time they won a matchless, unprecedented victory.
The elegance of the two great athletes in their balloons gliding on the water does not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal is a healthy team working hard to ensure that athletes continually improve their performance, and the greatest contribution to their success came from a coach who, 30 months ago, was diagnosed with cancer and did not know if he would live to see this day.
He said it disappeared as fast as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and it happened.
If I didn't, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would get out of control.
It changes your perspective a little.
William was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The trio succeeded in getting William to start the recovery process at the start of the 2014 off-season and to reduce the length of the suspension to a minimum, so to speak.
I needed income, so I needed to get well quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked 6, 10, and even 15 meters, even though the doctor said I would only take a few steps.
That's how it all started.
Airing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first thing that came to mind was Williams, who had been very upset all morning and had spoken more than usual because of his anxiety.
"It was an emotional week", says Stanning, who served with the Royal Artillery in Afghanistan, "but it means a lot to me".
It just confirms how much this means to us and how much Helen and Robin and I have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have made it, so thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't think of a better trainer or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair are reaching a speed that is so enormous that no competitor can compete.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover were too far ahead.
We felt every moment.
Helen's motto is "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm".
It is really important to keep your focus.
We got off to a good start, but at the same time, we didn't have high hopes.
We didn't set out to break records that day, but to get good air and win the race, and that's what we did.
They'll take a couple of years off to figure out what to do next.
Next month is the wedding of Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very upset.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "It feels fantastic".

The beautiful and energetic DTLA pups are experiencing a change in their home,
Celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Los Angeles Central Library with what?
The role of the EUSR will be "to the end".
He said that now it is "essential" for Minister-President Mari Kučinsky (Green and Farmers Union) and Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers Union) to confirm the candidates led by the Finance Ministers for the post of leader of the VP.
Rajevski read that the confirmation of both Kučinsky and Reznets-Ozola as the head of the VVD in this government is the "first big decision" that could affect their future as politicians.
If the choice of candidates for the post of head of the VP is now changed, it will have a negative impact on their image in the state administration.
The agenda of the next cabinet meeting is the transfer of the head of the VVD, Kolegov, to the post of Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to the government's agenda.
Mr Kolegov was appointed Head of the VIS by Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola after the resignation of Mr Inara Pettersson and the unsuccessful bid for the post of Director-General of the VIS.
In an interview with Latvijas Radio on Thursday, August 11, the acting head of the UNDP, Dace Pelēka, admitted that if she were offered the position of head, she could accept.
The Minister of Finance later acknowledged that no other candidates for the post of Director of the Ministry of Finance were being considered.
The head of the National Union parliamentary group Raivis Zintar also acknowledged that NA still supports Kolegav in the leadership of the VP.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit was not threatened by the possibility of forming a government.
On 12 July the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the budget deficit to the 3% of GDP required by the euro area.
Estimates show that despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit stood at 4,4% of GDP at the end of last year, compared with 5,1% in Spain.
The European Commission has, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the near term.
One of the reasons why the EC has not yet imposed sanctions on both countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many EU countries.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative sentiment.
Critics point out that the EC is inconsistent in its decisions, agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, has pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself by creating the impression among citizens that EU rules are advisory rather than binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for the budget deficit to the end of this year for Portugal and to 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission intends to review the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while indicating that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce further austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial forecasts suggest that Portugal could reach its target in time and that the budget deficit could fall to 2.5% of GDP this year.
This means that the government of that country has to implement a saving of 0,25% of GDP this year under the Stability Programme.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention to controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
The budget deficit should be reduced to 4,6% of GDP this year, to 3,1% next year and to 2,2% in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures should amount to 0,5% of GDP per year for the next two years.
The fact that the political parties have been unable to agree on a government for eight months makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and the possibility that early parliamentary elections could be held for the third time in a year is growing.
However, opinion polls suggest that even a third election would not significantly change the political landscape of the country.
The most popular party remains the People's Party, led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which again won the election with less than 33% of the vote.
Only the Socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the anti-austerity parties Podemos and Ciudadanos have declined slightly.
The People's Party wants to get the Socialists and Ciudadanos in government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval until mid-October.
The European Parliament's parliamentary group, the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, said that if the government failed to form and parliamentary elections were held for a third time, Spain would be the laughing stock of Europe.
The cleanliness of the lagoons in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
In their fifth year of surveying the beaches, activists have found that unfortunately, the amount of trash found is increasing every year, and the blame is mostly on the beachgoers.
The most polluted swimming areas are in Riga.
The capital city explains that the swimming pools are being cleaned every day, but it is quite difficult to fight against the unclean visitors.
In addition, waste left on land during rainfall can be dissolved in water, thus significantly reducing its quality.
With the exception of the beaches of Liepāja and certain places in Kurzemy, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This is the message that the volunteers of the My Sea campaign have shared this week.
For the fifth year running, activists have measured the road along the Riga Strait, and found that the amount of waste left by residents has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year, that critical evaluation has taken hold.
"We see this year that the amount of litter on the beach at 100 metres may even exceed 200 units", says Johannes Ulme, spokesman for the My Sea expedition.
He was on the beach of Tui, where the march of volunteers along the Riga strait continues.
This year, even sunflowers left in the sea sand will be collected by activists from various household debris and picnics.
The organiser of the march, Ulme, says that the people are to blame for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, a variety of waste starting from bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the process of decomposing, they can no longer be identified, and fumes, bottles, cork", says Ulme.
Among the most polluted beaches are swimming pools in Riga.
For example, in the city of Zagreb, on average, almost 800 waste units are collected per hundred metres, which is a critical number.
Campaign organizers also explain that almost every time you lie on the steps, you smoke and there are not warning or prohibition signs everywhere.
"The average figures for all three Riga swimming areas combined - Daugavpils, Vakarbuoli and Vecāki - are unfortunately high and far exceed the desired goal, or the one towards which Latvia seems to be moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", the environmentalist concludes.
The clean-up of swimming pools in Riga is carried out every day, even twice in the hottest days of summer, explains the representative of the House Ugyis Vidauskis.
However, it is quite difficult to fight against unclean visitors.
We're going back to this question of human culture.
"Even the labels don't work for those who cheat, drink, smoke, and do all the things they're not supposed to", Vidauskis says.
Vidauskis therefore encourages visitors to the swimming area to report the pollutants to the police.
You can call the police, you can point out these violations, and you can fight them all.
Maybe we can put some new warnings on, but like I said, I don't know if it's going to change things radically.
"So we all have to come together and be intolerant of these offenders", he stresses.
Meanwhile, the water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official swimming areas.
This year, as in previous years, the water quality was good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that all 56 swimming pools have always had good water quality and there are no restrictions on swimming.
"The last time we will take the tests is at the end of August", says Normund Kaddick, the inspection's senior environmental health officer.
During heavy rainfall, waste left on land may be dissolved in water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
Rotation in Russia's elite continues, with a change of leadership in the Putin administration.
You're quitting your job?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov had voluntarily resigned and would continue to serve as the President's Special Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport.
Announcing the changes, Putin addressed Ivanov in front of the television cameras with the words: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and we are doing it successfully".
I am satisfied with the way you are carrying out your duties.
I remember very well our agreement not to use you as the head of this presidential administration for more than four years.
So I'm going to be very understanding of your desire to change the scope of your work.
And I hope that in your new role, you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is pointed out that running the presidential administration is a very important position and that this made Ivanov one of the most powerful people in the country.
With the upcoming parliamentary elections in Russia, there is a growing concern that this step is linked to the struggle for power among Russia's political elite.
Ivanov was also mentioned as a possible Putin's deputy in the presidential office, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the position of the presidential representative on environmental protection and transportation issues has raised doubts.
According to the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanov is a colonel general of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a long-time and close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in the special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In the same year, he was appointed Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanov was approved, which included a revival of the state censorship mechanism in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became Minister of Defense of Russia, and in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov, responsible for the development of Russian defense industry enterprises and arms exports.
Now, after the resignation of the President's chief of staff, Ivanov will also retain his seat in the National Security Council of Russia, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will also work.
The blame comes from the family council party elite.
The post of Head of the Presidential Administration was recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
From the days we were in government under your leadership.
And for the last five years, we've been communicating virtually every day.
"I am therefore convinced that, by all the characteristics of his professional and personal character, he is ready for this work", Ivanov said.
Vinov comes from a family that belonged to the Soviet party elite.
Her grandfather Karl held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years as its first secretary until 1988.
The Medusa website, citing the book "Igonia's Self-determination and Independence", reports that in the late 1980s, Karl Vayno allegedly asked Moscow for permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was turned down and soon lost his job.
Shortly after that, Vaino moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and a master of the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the Presidential Protocol.
It has been reported that in recent days Russia has been rocked by the removal and even arrest of several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of several regional governors and federal officials.
Political experts say President Vladimir Putin is in the process of rearranging the ruling elite ahead of the upcoming 2018 elections.
One of the main features is the increasing presence of representatives of the power structures in the executive positions.
Judo boxer Nikiforenko also loses in his first Olympic fight.
This was the first round of the fight, and the Latvian judo boxer has finished his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskins admitted to Latvian TV that Nikiforenko's hopes were very low, and this was already clear before the competition.
He also discovered that the judo fighter had suffered a shoulder injury in a fight.
Interestingly, to reach the Olympic trials, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight class than his usual - a weight class of up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani was 25 kilograms heavier than the Azeri.
It has been reported that Yevgeny Borodavko held out for two and a half minutes in the 100 kg weight class against Ryunosuka before the opponent scored a clean victory.
Latvia's Rio Judo competition is therefore over.
Dreams disappear in the sands of Rio.
Thursday was introduced by the judoist Yevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a title challenger, but ambition can be a surprise.
He didn't.
Arthur Nikiforenko's task was even more difficult, since he had little experience and the opposition was respectable.
The result is similar, although he remained on the tatami for about a minute and a half longer than Borodavo.
Unfortunately, lately, Latvian judogies are lacking in ambition.
Since Gunár Kyrson and his financial stalwart Vladimir Shestakov left the federation, Alexander Jackevich left Latvia, there is no longer a "Golden Score" - the development of judo is on a downward slope.
Jackevich, who is here to consult the judges of Kazakhstan, and Vsevolod Zelony, no heirs.
But if it doesn't, it won't.
And that is the prerogative of the Federation.
So, as if from another galaxy, the promise of the Latvian Judo Federation president to win medals in Rio sounded like "Morning Panorama".
A flight away from reality.
Last night we were anxiously waiting for the beach volleyball match between Samoilov/Smeidens and Evandru/Pedru Solberg.
The intrigue is that in the death group, the losers are out.
The Latvian duo had a slight gap - they could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was heightened by the long game before.
No one wanted to die, and the feeling lingered on the wind all night.
The winds of the storm added to the players' problems.
At first, it seemed that it might be our most versatile companion.
But it didn't.
It was easy to play here against Latvia.
Just wait for Samoilov to come out.
They hit Canada, they hit Cuba at the end of the first set, and they hit the third set because the pressure was on.
The fisherman could fish at that time, because there was little work, but when he did, he did it to his credit.
The Brazilian Samoilov and Šmēdin could win in two sets, as the first took the lead with 16:15, but also stayed at 16, also extending the lost point limit.
But we could have lost 0-2 because the deficit in the second set was -4, but thanks to the wind, we managed to win.
The third one has already put Evandro in the line of duty.
The chains were unimpressive, the second flank often flew too close to the net, and Samoilov had very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a stranger in the field against the Cubans, he would have been more successful this time, and it would be unprofessional to only take a loss on Sas.
And Kreil was wrong, too, and it was symbolically that he hit the last block of the ball.
The team is gone.
This time, there was no luck either - in the third set, only two Evander attacks almost flew off the court, but the ball still hit the line.
Two axles were on the line.
Even the video of a controversial episode is favorable to the opponents.
If Evandro was bullied with serfs in the first two games, they were very productive against us.
All of these total losses on the table.
Now we need to calmly analyze the causes of failure.
Maybe they should have lived next to the stadium, like many, instead of with the delegation in the Olympic Village.
It's been two and a half hours.
Maybe a little confidence from the seven-game series.
Maybe I shouldn't have played in Klagenfurt, but I'd better get here sooner and get acclimated.
Maybe it was a mistake to find the top of the athletic field.
We're waiting for more questions than answers.
Our little game is over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments and the Jurmala Masters.
Smyth and Samoilov have never been friends in their lives and never will be, because they have too different personalities.
But that's not necessary.
When the dream of Olympic medals is shattered, the idea of divorce may arise, for the blame will be looked for not only in oneself but also in one's mate.
Divorce is not difficult, but it will be much harder to find a decent partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the violin, but John and Tom have already tried and also fought, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the tops of the world.
You can try Harald Regge, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Toch, go back to Martin Plevin, but it's no better than this option, which has proved itself more than once in the World Cup stages.
The sand of the copacaban did not smile at them this time.
That's all.
Of course, beach volleyball is also becoming more popular, couples are being introduced, and only a few are under six feet [2 m] tall.
This does not guarantee success yet, but it is a vital argument for victory.
The current ones are not.
Both athletes and journalists are able to view the venues offered by the organisers of the games and to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some of the tennis players don't stay in the Olympic Village.
Some beach volleyball players have also sought a hotel in Kopakaban.
This time, the prices charged for the modest hostels offered to journalists were greatly exaggerated.
That's why the choice fell on the apartment tenant.
The risk is, because sometimes they can be logistically unwieldy.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the border of Kopakaban and Ipanem.
A swimming pool 200 meters away, a half hour's walk to the bowling alley.
The area is quite safe, with the favelas lying low, but we must not lose our guard here.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people immediately imagine, but Vladimir Ivanov is the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media.
P.S. It looks like Friday morning, another medal dream was realized.
In the 100m hurdles and high jump, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa broke her own personal records.
But there are five more disciplines.
After a 10-year hiatus, Porgy and Bess is playing in Latvia.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgijs i Besa" was premiered in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally acclaimed masterpiece has not been revived.
That is why the organisers of the Arts Festival of Kęsto and the Arts Forum of Liwów decided to offer the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin's masterpiece.
"We are delighted that after a ten-year break, when the opera was last performed in Leipzig, this grand concert study of George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess is now available in our newly opened concert hall, the Big Gintaro", says Baiba Boze, director of the Big Gintaro concert hall.
Porgy and Bess is a story of love, its volatility, its passion, and the tragedy of life and the simple pleasures of everyday life, told in vivid musical language.
It was a reflection of African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It's this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so vivid.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some ways really deep", says director Vistorius Kairisch.
What I like most about listening to this opera, or playing it, is always the static, the famous melodies, the celebratory motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, highlighting one character or another character, or the choir, or the orchestra.
"It's the most exciting thing, this building", says Andris Pogo, music director and conductor of the opera's "Porgy and Bess" concert studio.
The audience of the opera is unanimous in saying that it is a grand event.
They are thrilled to hear this world-famous Gershwin opera.
It's a blessing to be able to feel the breath of the world in Lithuania.
"Executed professionally", the opera is judged by the audience, Edgar Lamm.
The concert hall was unique in that it was the first time the orchestra played in the orchestra's basement and the first time an opera was performed.
The area around the renovated building of the Museum of Art could be named after Jan Rosenthal.
The vice mayor of Riga, Andris Ameriks, announced at the opening of the Rosenthal jubilee exhibition that the museum's address in the future might not be Krišjanova Valdemara Street 10a, but Jan Rosenthal Square 1.
Museum director Mara Lăce acknowledged that the re-registration of the address would create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but the idea was generally welcomed and therefore agreed with the municipality's proposal.
The city of Riga laid a kind of foundation for this idea in 1936, creating the Burkard's Geneva Monument to Janim Rozenthal, which stands at the museum.
One of the initiators of the monument was the then director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvītis.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I'm always a little bit guilty, but William Purvitz, where do we put his name?
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think"... said Lace.
The National Museum of Art is reportedly opening its doors in May after a remarkable renovation and modernization.
This week, the VEF will finally begin the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture.
The building will be renovated by Velve for approximately EUR 11 million.
Several rooms of the palace, including two auditoriums, are planned to be renovated, as well as buildings adapted for people with reduced mobility.
The Riga Dome intends to raise six million euros from the European Union to fund the project, but Oleg Borow, Director of the Riga Dome's Specialties Department, admits that there is still no complete clarity about the European funds for the project.
"Despite the political desire to start the renovation of the VEF Palace of Culture, attracting European structural funds, we have been waiting for months for a decision, a real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether the money will be granted or not", says Burov.
Last December we were told that it was all up to Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission asking you to decide for yourself that Brussels would not decide here.
We're seeing another round of discussion now, so let's see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I want to say that the Riga Duma guarantees without a doubt that this process will be started and completed on time", Burov says.
It has been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Palace collectively held a farewell concert before the soon-to-be-renovated building.
Although a year had passed, the renovation of the building had not yet begun and the collective continued to work under unfavourable conditions.
The strategy of the Property Department of the Riga City Council for the renovation of the VEF Cultural City is divided into seemingly independent communities of renovation works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the city.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Cultural Village and to improve the surrounding area.
It is intended to provide the environment and engineering communications as well as to renovate the building's facade.
The second is to improve the offer of services of the WEF Cultural Palace.
It plans to restore the building's interior, walls and ceiling, improve the stage and sound recording studios, and arrange the building's internal engineering communications.
Third, improving collective working conditions for creative amateurs, including plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "LIVE" the legendary rock band can be introduced at an exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will explore various 'Lives' items, photographs that are reproduced in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the earliest days until 2010, when the group's activities are announced to be over.
The exhibition will also feature costumes, musical instruments, awards and recordings, as well as other unseen items from the creative work of the group "Līvi".
The exhibition will be supplemented by items from the collection of the Museum of Lichtenstein.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnić.
Musicians associated with the group "LIVE" and their relatives also responded to the invitation and shared objects and memories.
The origins of "Liv" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was formed in the House of Culture in Liepāja, led by Juris Pavitolas.
The ensemble participated in the festival "Liepaja zintar" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republican shows.
In 1976, the fateful meeting took place when Juris Pavitola met Erik Kigeli and formed a group at the Metalurgic Palace of Culture, inviting Ingrid Gutman, Andri Krūzinis and Jāni Groduma to join.
Over the years, the group's composition has changed several times.
Members have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is capable of living and existing - has remained unchanged.
"There was no shortage of jeans, mattresses, and barbells, and these boys were a marked departure from the stereotype of the stage", says music critic Klaus Wawere.
Besides the aforementioned musicians, the group included such fine musicians as Igor, Vilnis Rosiņš, Modris Stern, Valdis Stark, Laimas Răcenăi, Talius Pusbarnieks, Ainar Virga, Aivars Brizis, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Klein, and many others.
Admission to the exhibition is free.
The exhibition runs from 19 August to 30 October.
On August 27, the 40th anniversary of the group "Līvi" will be celebrated in the "Pūt, vējiņi" concert hall in the city of Liège.
Inflation in Bulgaria for the first time in eight months.
In July, the Bulgarian National Statistics showed monthly inflation of 1%.
This is the highest level since 2012 and the first level above zero since October last year, when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation rate after the PCI over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0,8% compared to the previous year.
The Commission also examined whether the Union industry was in a situation of undercutting and whether the Union industry was in a situation of undercutting.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the level of the aid, but that the aid is not compatible with the internal market.
Compared to the previous month, the following consumer goods groups showed price increases in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and cultural activities (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell on clothing and shoes (2.2%); household appliances, household appliances and regular home improvements (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices for alcohol and tobacco, utilities, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as in the previous month.
Zbigniew Stankevich: The time will come, and the truth will rise.
In an interview with Neatkarīga, Metropolitan Zbigniew Stankevich, archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, emphasizes that if we want to find life's strength, we must put the Gospel message at its center.
Because the power of truth is greater than the lust of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglon.
What message will be received by believers there this year?
In recent years, a desire to lead a central service in Aglon has been expressed by a papal nuncio.
Thus, the main message is his.
Another tradition is that the Way of the Cross is led by Bishop John Bull.
He'll make his own message, too.
I lead the service of the holiday vigil the day before.
Last year I focused on Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato Si' and updated the common house, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year, of course, I'm looking at what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my talk.
My approach is in line with the church's recommendation that the Gospel be the center of our lives.
It should be shown that the Gospel answers the deepest problems of man's life and inspires him on his journey.
Then it speaks to people.
But in the Lamp discussion, you said you were "returning to the full humanity".
What do you mean by that?
Does that mean that a person is excluded from the church message?
And does the church today have such a resource for return?
A man is dying on the side of a dirt road in the capital of India.
In India's capital, no one is aware of a man who died in a road accident, apparently lying on the side of the road for an hour before being robbed, reports the BBC.
It's been reported that the man identified as Matybull was riding a rickshaw by day and working as a security guard at night.
Matibull was on his way home at 5:30 a.m. when he was hit by a light truck.
The surveillance video shows the driver getting out of the car to look at the victim and then leaving.
After hours, when no one knew about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a crocodile.
About 90 minutes after the collision, police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to hospital, where he died from his injuries.
By withdrawing her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegava, saved the government from collapse, according to Ojārs Skudra, Associate Professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Colegova's explanation for withdrawing her candidacy in connection with the conflicts in the ruling coalition is related to the fact that she prevented the fall of the government.
In an interview with LETA, Skudra said that he could not imagine that "Unity" would support Colegov's candidacy at next week's government meeting.
Consequently, if the Union ministers voted against, but Mr Kollegov was confirmed anyway, it would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also considers that prior to the announcement of the withdrawal of her candidacy, Kolegova had consulted both Finance Minister Dan Reiznieci-Ozol and Prime Minister Mari Kuczynski.
It was also a step towards the 'Unity' party, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
In its forecast of whether the competition would lead to the selection of a suitable candidate, Mr Skudra acknowledged that there were two options: either a compromise figure would be chosen or the institution would continue to be run by Mr Dace Pelék as the acting Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidate is being considered, it is a misnomer for Pelēka to not be able to participate in the competition.
Latvia has already informed that the Head of the State Environmental Service, Kolegava, has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the Ministry of Environment.
On Tuesday, the government postponed Kolegav's confirmation as Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a week because of the opposition of the Unity Party.
Following the Government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she remains ready to become the head of the VDI.
However, she later changed her mind: in a submission to Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola on Friday, she stated that she was withdrawing her consent to move to the post of Director of the Ministry of Finance and that this was not an easy choice for her.
The press secretary of Prime Minister Maire Kučinska, Andrej Vyvar, explained to LETA that a new call for tenders will be held for the vacant post of Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
There's been an accident in the center of Riga involving a police car.
A traffic accident has occurred this afternoon in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
A police car with its sound and light signals on was on a high-speed call until it collided with another car at the intersection of Krishna Baron and Dzirnav Street.
Police are trying to explain the circumstances, but initial information indicates that the second officer did not miss the police car.
A woman was injured in an accident.
This year, the population of Riga has increased
At the beginning of this year, Riga had 638,784 inhabitants, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital officially had 641,000 inhabitants, the Central Statistics Office (CSP) informed LETA.
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the European Union (EU) capitals and large cities with a population of over one million.
According to Eurostat, the EU statistics office, Riga has the highest proportion of women - the Latvian capital is convincingly first among the largest European cities with 127 women for every 100 men.
The three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in the major European cities: 123 in Vilnius and 121 in Tallinn.
Warning pictograms shall be placed on the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), representative of the Real Estate Department of the Riga Duma, Baiba Gailīte, told LETA.
The restoration of the museum's glasswork, which was damaged by the speed of the skateboarders, has now been completed.
In the coming days, warning pictograms will be placed on the side of the road.
They will tell the residents that the cover is prone to snow and ice, and that cars, bicycles, skateboards, and skateboards are not allowed to travel over it.
Ushakov also wrote about the incident on Facebook, saying that the damage posed no safety risks, but "seems to be irregular", and that skateboarders "will be caught".
New playgrounds for children and parents in Riga.
This summer, the municipality has even installed two new playgrounds in the city, in Kipsalo and Čiekurkalna, which are now available to children.
A large, multifunctional toy boat with various climbing elements, bridges, rafts, pipes and skis is installed on the beach at Kimpsala.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The field is also equipped with cells and various balancing elements.
The imagination of the younger sailors is captured by the attraction's location on the Danube coast, overlooking the passenger port and the cruise ships that are visible there.
On the other hand, the playground between the 4th and 5th crossing of Čekurkalna has a playhouse, a batut, a staircase, a balance bridge, balls, toy bombs and other play elements, as well as an exercise area with rinkes for strength and coordination training, ladders and other sports elements.
Rubber covering of different colours is inserted under the field.
A new, colorful cover of the trousers has been added to the playground from the street side.
Reconstructed section of road discovered in Medumo.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the Latvian State Roads (LVC) Administration of the State Administration of Transport, as well as representatives of the construction company SIA "Binders" and local authorities today unveiled the reconstruction of the main national highway of the Russian border (Grebnev) -Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
Roads are a national tourist card, especially border roads, so it is a special treat to discover a reconstructed section of the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the improvement of the situation on the main national motorways thanks to the co-financing of EU funds.
"According to forecasts, the funds available for roads during this planning period will be used up as early as 2018, and we have to think about how to continue to maintain the most congested motorways in very good quality, and also ensure population mobility in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding", said Uldis Augulis, crossing the symbolic line.
The Minister also stated that the proposals prepared by the transport experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
The construction works on the Medumi to Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km) phase were started by SIA Binder last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The cost of the reconstruction is EUR 13,5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The road construction has been completely restored during the reconstruction phase and next year the repair work will start on the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, thereby arranging the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils", informed the Chairman of the Board of LVC, Jānis Lange.
The national main roads are the most congested and by 2018 we plan to have all the main roads in good condition.
The next challenge will be to maintain them in good quality by providing periodic maintenance and replacing the asphalt overhang every 7-9 years.
'This will of course require adequate funding and all travellers are looking forward to the proposals developed by the expert group to streamline the road financing system,' Lange noted.
Road connections and lighting in Medumu centre will be arranged as part of the project.
Significant earthworks: large-scale re-scaled and extensive grafting and weighing works in four stages, smoothing the road profile, which had been very uneven until now.
Public transport stations have also been renovated and a public transport turn-off has been rebuilt.
The road was previously impassable and the terrain was not clear due to the mountainous valleys and the old road's general terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the section of the motorway from the city limits of Daugavpils to the now reconstructed section (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various types of work on more than 1100 kilometres of national roads.
Information on all planned repairs to the national motorway network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"Choosing the right food combination is very important to achieve the desired weight loss results", admits Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene, a Lithuanian dietitian.
Moreover, it is easy to do during the summertime, when fresh fruits, berries, and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
Combining thoughtful foods can help not only to reduce excess weight but also to promote various bodily processes in a meaningful way.
The combination of pasta and etchings is a good one, as it provides a long-lasting homey feel and helps fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that etiquette has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel better.
Cyanide- and protein-rich foods, such as poultry or protein cocktails, not only make you feel at home but also reduce cravings for large meals at subsequent meals.
This combination of foods can increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35 percent.
Studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help to lose fat in the abdominal area.
The egg contains the metabolic nutrient choline, and the pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
Adequate intake of this nutrient can reduce cortisol levels and thus fat accumulation around the mid-body.
Eggplant butter with fresh berries is another flavorful, fat-burning breakfast item worth including on your menu.
Eggplants and walnuts contain fiber that Canadian scientists have found to control ghrelin, the appetite-stimulating hormone, and thus the hunger.
In addition, they contain polyphenols, which help to reduce weight and prevent fat formation.
Nutrition and protein can also do wonders for weight loss.
This combination can create a sense of home.
The water and fiber content of the pots makes them feel like home.
At the same time, protein slows down the digestive process and keeps you home for longer.
At noon, you can eat a sandwich with salads or make a protein cocktail from the mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What product combinations to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars, either monosaccharides or disaccharides, which are one- or two-molecule compounds.
In contrast, starch, which is found in vegetables, is a polysaccharide.
The fruits break down mechanically in the intestine, but they do not break down chemically until they reach the third or fourth stage of digestion, which takes place in the intestines.
The stomach is divided into three distinct phases, starting in the mouth.
It is therefore important not to eat a balanced meal immediately after a meal.
When the residue is eaten immediately after a meal, it is "stretched" into a dish with other foods, where it is not chemically digested and begins to ferment.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme pthyalin, found in the bran, is active only in the sulphur environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, lard and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and lard, meat and milk, eggs and milk or combination of eggs and milk and similar protein-rich products at the same meal.
The processing requires different digestive salts, each with different strengths, characteristics and time to boil.
Watermelon, melon, nutmeg and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not broken down if they are stored in the tray with other foodstuffs.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats are a good combination with starch, but the same cannot be said for fats and proteins - fats inhibit protein breakdown.
Protein can be combined with very little fat.
If you consume a large amount of protein, avoid fat altogether.
This also applies to the process of frying - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of avocado (protein) with whole avocado (fat).
This combination prevents effective weight loss.
What's the best way to cook?
"Cooking, heat treatment, and other processes cause significant nutrient losses - about 15 to 55 percent of the original nutrient content of the food", the nutritionists note.
In most cases, nutrients are lost when food is boiled in water.
However, some foods increase in nutritional value by boiling directly.
The liquid left over from the vegetable is recommended for soup, which will save the nutrients left in the water and allow you to eat it later.
It is recommended that the tablets be prepared, including by steaming.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene in tomatoes.
If you boil tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, peaches, sweet potatoes and legumes.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural properties of the protein in them, making them more digestible.
The heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce vitamin C levels by 10% to 90%, while freezing the fibre does not.
The combination of beans and tomatoes can increase the body's iron intake, which in turn improves brain and muscle function.
Our bodies absorb up to 33 percent less of the iron found in non-fertile plant products, such as beans, leafy greens, and grains, than the iron found in animal products, such as beef, fish, and poultry.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-acquired iron by taking non-acquired iron products in combination with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and legumes.
Vitamin C helps to change the iron that is not produced in the body so that it is more easily absorbed.
Iron is needed to produce hemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get the most out of your salads, add healthy fats, such as olive or linseed oil.
When making buttercream, add vitamin D-rich butter or sardines to the butter, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestines and plays an important role in bone formation.
Eggs (as well as other whole grains) together with sources of vitamin C, such as carrots, beans, oats, and other fruits or vegetables, help to stabilize cholesterol levels and prevent arterial congestion.
Snapchat's "Anime" effect is criticized for caricaturing the underdog
Snapchat officials say the filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators say it's racist.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to alter reality in a completely absurd way and to play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple or a dog or a statue that fits in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are blurry, image-distorting devices that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become public knowledge.
The lens effects of Snapchat have been criticized in the past, with criticism that the app popularizes overly dark hair or light facial skin tones as the ideal beauty standard.
This week, new lens effects were released that allow users to create eyeballs, fangs, and round eyes, and some critics have dubbed it a racist, obscene cartoon.
It was also asked whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had a greater diversity problem.
News and public denial erupted on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard announced that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to portray Anime characters, not to caricature people of Asian descent.
But for those who had experienced racism, these effects were reminiscent of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity to Anime.
A tweet about the images by Korean-American art student Greisa Sparapani, who wrote in an email that the lens effects were "excuseable and inappropriate to say more", has been widely shared.
She added that it is difficult not to notice the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the lens effect is not just yellow faces, but yellow faces in the sense of racism.
Snapchat isn't the only company that has fallen into these cultural gaps.
American culture, too, is engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood to the gadgets we use every day.
And Snapchat's large, racially diverse youth audience, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to this sort of thing.
When Snapchat's lens creates an image that offends users, "this kind of thing doesn't go unnoticed these days", said 25-year-old Katie Zhou in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhou, the product manager at Medium, deleted her Snapchat app and encouraged others to do the same.
In her article Medium and in a telephone interview, she explained that she believed the problems with race arose from Snapchat's employment policies which did not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the company's management, which is made up mostly of white men, and then ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
"It means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so decisions are made, and if there are some people of other races working in the company, they don't take jobs that allow them to express their opinions safely and comfortably", says Zhou, a Chinese-American.
Others agree with her, and Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees representing different races, stating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but a representative revealed that the company had hired a human resources specialist who would focus on representing underrepresented racial minorities and promote inclusion.
Joe, on the other hand, didn't update his Snapchat account, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that this is not right".
The House of Representatives announces that military officials have tampered with reports of ISIS.
In a statement released Wednesday, the House of Representatives said U.S. Central Command officials misrepresented the reports, portraying the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as far more optimistic than it actually is.
Central Command intelligence analysts express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force set up by Republican representatives of the Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Finance Subcommittee, indicating that their leadership controlled reports of American successes in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report is that intelligence reports confirmed by high-ranking Centcom officials portray the US war on terrorism more positively than it actually is.
California Republican Rep. Ken Calvert said: "The actions of Centcom are unacceptable - our troops are the ones who suffer when our policymakers receive the wrong messages".
Centcom is looking for management failures at the top of the organization.
This 10-page report details the problems with Central Command's reporting and analysis of the US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials were left to edit the reports, it does suggest that Centcom management has put some pressure on analysts to paint a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any information from the GOC on the measures taken by the GOC in the context of the investigation.
For example, Centcom representatives have publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under Islamic State control.
In a report, Mike Pompeo, the Republican Party representative from Kansas, said: "A multi-month investigation has made this clear".
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top U.S. Central Intelligence officials distorted reports, portraying the ISIS threat in Iraq as weaker than it actually was.
The Republican Party set up a task force after it learned that analysts were concerned that information about ISIS was being misrepresented.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will follow up with new findings in this case.
The Ministry of Defence Inspectorate-General is investigating the activities of the Centcom intelligence services.
The Democratic members of the Intelligence Steering Committee released their own report Thursday agreeing with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
In his report, Democrat Rep. Adams B. Schiff states that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom over-restricted the preparation of intelligence assessment reports related to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "stopped the spread of information", degraded the work ethic of analysts, and "spread falsehoods".
But Schiff and members of the Democratic Party added that there was no evidence that the White House pressured Centcom analysts to produce reports in accordance with "a predetermined or political position".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's Inspector General had opened an investigation after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Commander Patrick Evans announced that the Pentagon will not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continues.
He also noted that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the MoD and the Intelligence Community call for constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has been successful (a view increasingly expressed by Department of Defense officials).
But last year's allegations have raised questions about whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Command's reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State espionage echoes events more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration started the war in Afghanistan with too little thought about its possible consequences.
Hucker also played a significant role in uncovering the Islamic State's espionage.
Last year, officials reported that the hacker team found that contrary to public reports, the airstrikes on Islamic State oil facilities did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times of September reported that this discovery did not come from outside the walls of the Central Administration.
At the time, the commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd Austin III, was widely criticized for the way many lawmakers viewed war reports as too positive.
In April, General Austin resigned and was replaced by General Joseph L. Wattell.
The United States defeated Great Britain in a women's field hockey game, securing its fourth consecutive victory.
The day after the 6-1 victory over Japan, on Thursday, Katie Bama scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team as the Americans defeated the Indian team 3-0.
Five goals in two games is a remarkable feat, but the 27-year-old Bama said that she could not remember if she had ever done that.
She said, "I have no idea".
I'm not one of those people who count their losses.
But she knows that the U.S. Olympic team is 4-0, which puts them in a group with Great Britain, who went undefeated after a 2-0 win over Japan on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the final first-round match.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will only determine which team will be first and which team will be second in the six-team group.
The first-place finisher will avoid a slightly longer encounter with the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of the second group.
Even if Saturday's game doesn't happen, the Americans have already called for a storm of surprise, finishing last out of 12 teams in London four years ago.
That team included Bama.
She grew up in Bluebell, took up field hockey for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sister was already involved in the sport in Drexel) and joined the national side when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she did not make the final.
But 2012 was a bad year for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parham of England was appointed as the national team's coach, and things changed for the better.
Bamm called it "cultural, mental, and physical change".
In London, we never invested as much work as we do now.
We've changed everything completely.
In Thursday's game, Bama scored in the first half with a late goal from close range.
India started the match without a win on their own but their selection was very tight and kept a minimal score of 0-1 until the end of the third period when Bama again scored.
She entered the opposing zone on the left side of the field, then managed to get to the center of the field and throw the ball into the opposing goal, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzalez scored another goal.
This was the first dry game of U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who scored a goal in each of his first three games.
She's in a hurry.
And so is Bama.
"We're doing very well", Paham said, "but how good will the game be on Saturday".
The most depressing meal of the depression is the "Saturation Meal".
In March 1933, shortly after he was elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room to eat lunch.
President Roosevelt enjoyed such fine culinary delicacies as a goose liver stew or a fuagra and a Maryland canned beef soup.
But his meals were much more subtle: eggs stuffed in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who have been through a lot", says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "It is also a message to Americans about how to eat".
A couple of Brooklyn Heights food historians.
Kou's latest book, The Rapture of the Grapes, describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelman's book, The 97 Habits, describes life through a food court in lower East Side Manhattan.
Their new collaborative work, "Saturated Meal", to be published by Harper Tuesday, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
In a show of solidarity in the culinary world, they shared a meal with the reporters at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch restaurant in the Flatiron district that had been in operation since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
Mrs. Ziegelman, 54, ordered butter bread with grated cheese and chopped olives, and Mr. Kou, 57, ordered tomatoes, mashed potatoes, and vegetable salads.
When a reporter ordered a counterfeit duck, the couple recognized that her choice was very appropriate for a Great Depression meal.
Mrs. Siegelman said that the fake rabbit was very popular.
The land rabbit, the liver rabbit, and the puppy rabbit built it.
They were made from the main ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine eating so much dirt that it's lunch.
Mr. Kou was a bit of a mess.
"It must have been like a belly full of lead", he added.
In the pre-Depression years, the American lunch plate was similar to the Swedish plate, especially in rural areas.
The women prepared food for their male workers, and they served freshly prepared dishes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
During World War I, Americans were the ones who sent food to Europe. The "Saturated Meal" describes how Americans adapted to the situation when America suddenly ceased to be a land of plenty.
"Food became the focus of American daily life", says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally important were the new budget diets: unfamiliar foods such as fake duck and sausages became commonplace, and sausages were "a great way to use up leftovers", noted Mrs. Ziegelman, because the pigs could hide unattractive ingredients under creamy scales.
Fresh fruit was replaced by slow-drying fruit.
Meat, which for years was a staple of American meals, has become an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when calorie count and nutritional value were more important than taste, new, unseen forms were emerging.
In an old cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelman found recipes for peanut butter-filled onions.
Mr. Kou adds: "It was not a popular lunch item".
"It was surreal", Ms. Siegelman emphasizes.
Peanut butter and baked onions are not compatible.
Many home-cooked recipes are suitable for difficult times.
Household economists such as Louis Stanley, head of the Federal Household Economic Bureau from 1923 to 1943, set national eating patterns that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
In articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged households to become "economists" and to accept challenges such as turning a pasta-and-burrito mixture into a delicious meal.
The "Saturated Maltese" is a historical delicacy.
Particularly interesting are the accounts of governmental treatment of its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
Although he publicly spoke of his humble childhood and his meals in Iowa, he actually ate like the glamorous millionaire he had become.
"He liked European cuisine", says Mr. Kou, "like fish and pickle sauce".
He was eating in a nearly green hotel room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely cut off from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake had his wife, Eleanor, not advised him to set an example by his eating habits.
The book says that Roosevelt hired a maid who had no previous experience in cooking, and the White House became "not only the place where one of the most disgusting dishes in Washington was served, but also the place where the worst food was prepared".
As the nation's economy recovered, most of the Depression-era culinary traditions disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrition and how to apply science to cooking, added Ms. Ziegelman.
The couple said that by writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she could not throw food out.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food", said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Siegelman said, "She was really treating people".
There was an incident with the windmills.
While we were eating in Eisenberg's dining room, a couple of writers pulled out a homemade dessert: the plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunchtime.
"It's the dust of feathers", Mrs. Ziegelman said, adding that it was common practice at the time to name fancy foods chic.
It has no dust, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was impatiently dipping the carrots in the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Coe ate some more of the stuff.
He listened to an experienced "economist" and told her: "I'd like to make a stick of lettuce".
Gilead to be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against Merck over the patent for hepatitis C
The district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover the legal expenses it paid in the patent infringement case against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was acquitted of a $200 million fine for infringing two Merck patents that had been infringed on it in connection with the successful Swaldi and Harvoni tablets, after a U.S. federal judge found violations of Merck's practices, such as lying after submission of an oath and other unethical practices.
At the hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labson Freeman ruled that Gilead has the right to seek compensation for the legal costs it incurred in representing the students in this case.
Merck is trying to gain market position against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that are 90% effective in liver disease.
The case was initiated in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for trying to obtain ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient in Gilead.
US-backed forces claim to have fully taken control of Manbij city from the Islamic State.
US-backed forces have fully taken control of the city of Manbij in the north of the country on the Turkish border and the last Islamic State fighters have left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are currently clearing the city of the last remaining enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilian hostages taken by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under our full control and we are searching for fighters", he told Reuters.
The Clintons' 2015 income was $10.75 million, and the couple paid a 34.2% federal income tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent, respectively.
During 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mostly to her Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million as a spokesperson and former Secretary of State earned $3 million from her book on work at the State Department, published in partnership with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Keane of Virginia, and his wife, Anna Holton, have released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Keane continue to set new standards for financial transparency", Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmer said in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is hiding behind various pleas and excuses to avoid fulfilling promises to disclose his tax information.
The disclosure of tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cite the IRS audit as a reason for not disclosing tax information.
"Your Walk", tweeted Ian Sam, Clinton's campaign partner, about the Democratic nominee's tax information.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax information until the audit was complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, claim that his resignation raises questions about his real estate, donations and other business commitments, including ties to Russia.
Clinton has been adding fuel to the fire by releasing a video on Friday in which several powerful Republicans are asking Trump to release his tax information.
She returned to this question again during an economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She told the police: "He refused to do what other presidential candidates have done for decades".
The Politico reports that for two years in the 1990s, Trump paid little or no taxes, and on Friday, the New York Times business columnist reported that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a big issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of Warren Buffett's proposal, popularized the idea that anyone earning more than $1 million a year should pay at least 30% in taxes.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, which is also home to his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Buffett invited Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also being audited by the IRS, and Trump is afraid of voters, not the IRS.
The Clinton campaign has released tax information up to 2007.
Clinton now lives in Chappaqua, New York, and between 2007 and 2014, has paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton has received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for unlocking Israeli phone code at Arab request
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin made a storm on social media when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli long-distance telephone number, based on a request from Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, director of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, made no secret of his dissatisfaction with the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel in Berlin and wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli phone code on a hotel's listing.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel is being crushed and destroyed?
This is Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director asked the hotel staff for explanations.
Lancman writes that the response "shocked him".
The hotel manager explained that "it was a conscious decision of the hotel management".
The reason for the code removal further angered the filmmaker.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the erasure of the Israeli code", Lancman quoted a hotel employee as saying.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the incident a "great shame".
We are shocked and appalled by this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that it's happening in Germany, in this hotel chain, is even more humiliating.
No explanation is necessary.
The official said: "We hope the hotel will come to the right conclusions".
The incident also received considerable media coverage on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply served Arab customers.
Another entry said "shame", indicating that the hotel was located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly denied any wrongdoing, saying it was a "misunderstanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the country code list", Kempinski's spokesman was quoted as saying by the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
And adds that the code was added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting students in Brazil.
A clash between students and police took place in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, as students gathered to protest government reforms to the education system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The trouble began when law enforcement officers tried to drive the students out, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the reforms in the education system.
The proposal of the Governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, is to close almost 100 public schools and transfer 300 000 students to other schools in order to save money.
Some protesters graffitied the walls with messages against interim president Michael Temer.
This protest came just days after the previous protest, when students rallied in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the Senate.
Scott Kelum Skinner finishes first, bringing Britain the gold medal in cycling
Calum Skinner of Scotland finished first in the men's cycling team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night, and the British team defended their title, which they won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow played a key role in this race, making the legendary Scotsman Sir Chris Howe proud and winning the favourite to New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a stunning victory when Howe won the fifth of her six Olympic gold medals.
And they did it again at the World Championships in London, even though Hoey had already finished his athletic career.
The problem was between the Beijing and London Olympics, when I had to replace the experienced starting specialist Jamie Staff.
They got it at the last minute.
When Hoye left, Kian Emady and Matt Crampton tried to fill his place.
The British coaches had high hopes for Skinner, seeing potential in him, which he later proved.
Hinds, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Howe and Skinner, who set an Olympic qualifying record, but the better start was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won the gold medal.
The Indians were in tight quarters, and Kenny was in the lead, and Skinner was the one who held the lead.
The change in strategy played a major role in the victory as Hinds drove with a larger transmission to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Hoye was watching the race as a BBC correspondent, and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenya and Hinds as they climbed the podium.
A 23-year-old Glasgow man said: "It was an unimaginable honor".
I'm doing everything I can to defend my name.
In the final, we set an Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After winning the 2012 London Olympics with Kenya and Howe, Hinds admitted that he had deliberately crashed onto the track after a poor start.
He later disputed this comment and the British competitors were unable to prove otherwise.
This time, there was no such incident.
Hinds said: "The British flags in the stands recalled London".
In the last three months, we've become a tight-knit team.
We've lost so many World Cups, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal will go to the country that won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the team's progress over the last five months, the next five days are going to be very exciting.
Given Kenya's performance, he could indeed replicate Howe's success with three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, that would mean six gold medals and one silver, and for Kenya, March 23 is also the date of birth (apparently a British holy day, as Steve Regev, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born on that date).
This is also the date of Hoy's birth.
Kenya's next race is the sprint, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it now.
A team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
If you're honest, it's a little lonely to win alone".
Hinds said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be promoted to the rank of gunner".
It was the only medal match that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke and Owen Doulls have all set the fastest qualifying time in the four-kilometer fours.
His time was 3:51.943
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final will be held later today, where Wiggin will definitely be the center of attention.
Yesterday before the qualifying run, he had a run-in with the police station when the judges called him in to measure his height.
In the women's race, which continues and concludes today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rowsela Shand, Elinora Barker and Katie Archibald of Milwaukee set a new course record of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will, hopefully, win a medal in the mid-Olympic.
After the remarkable and unprecedented performances in Beijing and London, everyone is expecting the same in Rio.
Meanwhile, there have been many behind the scenes, including the resignation of Chief Technical Officer Shane Sutton and the retirement of Roy and Victoria Bendleton, after accusations of sexism and defamation.
But as the first Velodrome races begin, it seems that the British will reach the pinnacle of the sport in time, as always.
The future of the Portland coal mine is uncertain as a lucrative contract is terminated.
The future of the aluminum mine and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become uncertain as its main customer, the energy company, announces its termination.
This communication is based on the Victorian Government's plans to end the subsidies to the energy company, which are vital to the company's continued operation.
The 20-year-old subsidies will be terminated in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, since the plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry field, leading to the termination of the Anglesea power station.
The Alcoa Portland distillery is operating at a loss and may be closed.
These events led to years of speculation about the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production at the plant.
The plant's energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroube Valley, says that the other three owners are also likely to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plants are owned by the Alcoa and Alumia joint ventures, and the Chinese holding companies CITIC and Marubeni Corp. of Japan also own shares.
AGL looks forward to the continued operation of the Portland plant, which would mean the future energy supply to the plant", said a spokesman.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
The agreements have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
AGL also plans to receive revenue from these contracts in the 2017 financial year", said a company spokesman.
As from the 2018 financial year, the potential impact on profits is limited by the favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
AGL claims that it has already booked a loss of USD 187 million in its forecasts, anticipating that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa notes that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue operating the mine or to supply energy to it.
The US company reports that in 2010 it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, but that it will be terminated in November.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland mine in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the industry.
Steven Mickelson, CEO of AGL, said last week that analysts estimate that Portland uses 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants were to exit the energy market, the demand for energy would fall significantly.
And that wouldn't be good.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 claims are rejected each year, and the situation could get worse if the budget is cut.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the means to fight illegal immigration - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community Legal Centre, which is already overburdened, warns that a reduction in funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have so far.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Legal Centre, said that the latest report from the National Legal Centre Association shows that thousands of people who need legal aid are being denied it.
Mr Farrell pointed out that if this decision was not repealed, the situation would only get worse.
He adds: "The Queensland Legal Centre is consistently underfunded, meaning that thousands of people who need it are denied help".
People trying to end abusive relationships, people in deep debt, families going through divorce, workers being dismissed dishonestly - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30%, meaning that thousands more Queenslanders will have to solve their complex legal problems without help.
We've called on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brands to stop the funding cuts immediately so that people who need legal help can get it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to also address the needs of the local community and their customers and for the Palazchuk Government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign is on trial for firing a gun at a staff member.
New York: Donald Trump campaign organizers are facing charges for failing to act after receiving information that their North Carolina operations manager turned a gun on an employee while they were riding in the same car in February.
This incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte County Court by Vincents Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months for an internal investigation of this case to begin, but realized that it would not happen.
The driver, Earl Philip, "pulls out his pistol, puts his right index finger on the light and turns the barrel against Vincent's sidearm", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claimed that by lodging a complaint with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
"The heroes do not have to shoot to cause damage", Bordini wrote in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was filed, the Republican presidential nominee caused a scandal by telling people that the "People of the Second Amendment", that is, gun owners and enthusiasts, could act in case his candidacy for Hillary Clinton and her elected judges won the election.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had never incited anyone to violence.
Bordini's claim is for compensation from campaign organizers for improper surveillance, but from Phillips for assault, illegal use of a weapon and emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Houpa Hicks did not immediately comment.
I haven't been able to get in touch with Phillips.
WCCB, the local news agency in Charlotte, reports that Philip recently left the campaign.
Nor was it possible to contact his consultancy, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
In the case Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Campaign Committee Inc. 16-CS-14300, the General Court, the High Court of Justice of the United States, Mecklenburg, Charlotte.
New tradition - village and sports festivals in Kielce.
On Saturday, people gathered for the first time in Kielce for village and sports festivals.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided that this time Ezra's Feast would not be celebrated.
The new page is now divided.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time, the competition was not traditional and was not taken too seriously, for example, the arrows had to be thrown at the sleeping target, the kite was flown, the man's left hand was used to hit the ball, and "bullfighting" was not at all present in any of the Olympic Games.
Yet, each contestant was able to show how strong, courageous, active, and resilient he was.
After the games, everyone gathered at the Freedom Square, where the village festivities began.
At the same time, "children's stalls" were being set up, where children could enjoy the exciting attractions and get new idols in the makeup of their faces.
What could become a tradition was a motorcycle parade, with tractors and motorcycles.
The audience was addressed by the head of the Olomouc district administration, Inga Kadike-Skadina, who observed the pleasant weather and dry weather, rain and still a lot of rain, but it did not disturb much.
The celebration continued with the greeting of the newest residents of Kulciem.
It's really good that the cast has been augmented with five girls and one boy.
The audience was very pleased with the performances of the senior dance group "Rudens ritmi", the performers of various folk dances "Redas" and the youth dancers "Zelta perla".
And it's no wonder that on the backstage, somehow, I slipped.
Of course, the locals and villagers were delighted by the famous duo of actors John Jaran and Dainis Porgant, who were again Mildyna Nabina and Skaidryta Kraniena, as well as the attractive wife of Birzciem from the fishermen's lodge "Dieniņas".
The dance was by the Bruges.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in the local areas and in London, but also throughout the country.
I think that makes Heathrow very attractive, just like in London in 2012, where we invested a lot of work to make sure that all regions of the country benefit from the Olympics.
Stratford and Eastend won an extraordinary amount from the Olympics.
And we're going to do it again by providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities outside of Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
As with the London 2012 Olympics, there will be those who will consider the challenge too great and the expansion of Heathrow too ambitious.
At the time, people were saying that Britain would never qualify for the Olympics in time and that it would be a world-wide defeat.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012, and they won't be right about Heathrow either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome them all so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits society as a whole, not individuals.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180 000 new jobs, 211 billion in economic growth, and to create the foundation for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout the UK.
A great team has been working in Heathrow to create an infrastructure investment programme worth 11 billion Bahr, on time and within budget, starting with Terminal 5, which was named the best airport terminal in the world five years on, and ending with Terminal 2, which is built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to build a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion marks.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success and I am sure that the expansion of Heathrow will be as well.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is a member of Heathrow's board and former commercial secretary to the Treasury.
In Switzerland, a woman runs into a highway trying to commit suicide.
The troops landed on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are trying to track down witnesses to the accident, when she was hit by several cars on the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident happened shortly after midnight on Thursday on the A1 road near the town of Morges in the canton of Vaud.
A police report in the canton of Vaud states that a woman, desperate to commit suicide, had been lying in the dark on the road when she was hit by several cars.
In a frantic suicide attempt, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss man, broke down several vehicles, including a heavy one.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already testified, but others involved are still unaccounted for, police say, calling for the recall of the drivers involved and witnesses to the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been launched, which is a logical step in this case, lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Could the collision have been avoided?
Hofsteller adds: "That will be determined by the prosecutor".
Two similar incidents in the last five years indicate that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had taken the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not expect to find a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of manslaughter for negligence when she hit a man asleep in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Pajern in August 2014.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and was later seen falling asleep on the street.
The court found that the officer who was on his way to the scene of the accident had been driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances, and the judge recognized that the man lying on the road was "a completely unpredictable and extraordinary incident".
Anyone with information about the incident near Morges on Thursday is requested to contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Online subscriptions for the competition for the new post of Head of the VIS.
A petition portal called Avaaz.org has started collecting signatures for the new head of the State Revenue Service (SRS) competition.
The petition, addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Green and Peasants Union (ZZS), states that the society wants a transparent and professional process for the nomination of officials.
The petition was launched on 10 August and has so far been signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating Ingas Kolegava as the applicant for the post of Director-General of the JRC is disruptive and unprofessional.
This is a reminder of the best traditions of the officials of the Council of the Union.
This discredits the government and once again causes the public to become disillusioned with government and politics.
'A competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be assessed is needed,' reads the text of the petition.
Its author, Mr B. John, stated that the public did not know the criteria for the selection of Kolegova for the post.
It is also unclear what the candidate's intention is to work in the UK.
The petition states that the Chancellery should establish a new open competition, in which professional candidates are actively consulted, personnel specialists are recruited and appropriate remuneration is offered.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola last week officially nominated Kolegaov as head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the government was supposed to confirm him in the new post this week, but all the ministers of the Unity party voted against it, so the question of the week was postponed.
If we lost, I played badly.
The volleyball players Aleksandr Samoilov and Janis Šmēdiņš hoped for a medal at the Rio Olympics, but without it, there is no difference in the place where the competition ends, after the withdrawal of the tournament by Samoilov.
One of the strongest beach volleyball pairs in the world in the final and decisive game of Thursday's sub-group tournament, losing 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) to Brazil's Evandro Gonsalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgado, ending their participation in the most important sports forum for four years.
In the three sub-group matches, Latvian athletes won one, but the same ratio was in two other pairs.
The result was a three-pair low point ratio, which after the convincing loss suffered in this match was the most unfavorable for the Latvian duo.
"In the first set we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we were still 16 points", recalled the game.
I don't even know how we missed the rest of the set.
You can't play that.
Then in the second set everything was fine and at the end of the set we managed to break the game, and there should be a good basis for the third set as well.
We started it the same way, but after we switched sides, the result only grew for one team.
We made too many mistakes in the attack.
In the lower group, all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so it was a matter of low points.
"We had to play more evenly instead of giving three or four points in a row", said the athlete.
We knew Evander could be caught.
"In the first set we got through it, in the second we scored 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already lost the game", recalled Šmēdiņš.
We tried to put on the best game.
It's quick, it's not quick.
I hadn't seen the comparison situation before the match, but I knew that I needed as few points as possible.
"If we lose, I must have played badly", Samuel warned.
Evandro was expected to do well in the first set, but in the third set he had a hard serve and had a hard attack.
I made a lot of mistakes in my admissions at Peter's office, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match, today the athletes were not nervous.
"We walked, we played, we had the defense, but we needed a better serve", the athlete said.
"They played well and ended up in the 'urra'".
We said right before the tournament that this is the most uncomfortable outcome we could have had.
We had a chance to fight for first place, but we didn't even get out of the group.
"Everyone expected a medal and we expected ourselves, but after that there is no difference - 25th or fourth", said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo would continue to play together in the future.
I thought we'd be fine and keep playing together, because this is just one tournament.
It was the third Olympic Games of his career, as he started in Beijing with Martin Plevin in 2008, and four years ago he played in London with Ruslan Sorokin.
Meanwhile, for Schmidt, it was his second start in the Olympics.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
The state energy company Latvenergo is following the process of opening up the gas market both as a consumer and as a potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
'The decision whether to enter the gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by the gas market model and legal framework that will be established.'
'That is why we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of legislation and submitting our proposals,' said Bidere.
The BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economy (ME) in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the energy company Latvijas Gāze has prepared a draft Cabinet Regulation on the 'Regulations on the sale and use of natural gas' which will change the principles of the existing natural gas market by providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose a natural gas dealer from 3 April 2017.
In working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, the most efficient and user-friendly service solution was the 'dealer-centric model' where all customer service activities are provided by the trader, with one contract, one invoice and one information and customer service point, leaving the technical aspects of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
It is recalled that the market opening for household customers is planned to be phased in, with those household customers who do not wish to choose another natural gas dealer, also after 3 April 2017, being able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing dealer at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
'In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader,' the Ministry informed.
Traders will have to choose the natural gas dealer with whom to conclude the natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trading contract, traders will be supplied with natural gas for a specified period of time by the existing natural gas trader at the price specified by the latter.
The draft Cabinet Regulations detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, the system operator and the users.
The rules shall lay down the procedures for the supply of natural gas to users and for its interruption, the requirements for safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gas facility in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures for the settlement of the services received, the percentage of delay, the procedures for the change of traders and the provision of users in the event of interruption of the supply of natural gas; the procedures for the provision of natural gas to connected users by the public trader.

Minister: next week, the decision on the increase in the salary of the Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers Union (ZZS)) plans to discuss next week with Prime Minister Marie Kuczynski (ZZS) and government coalition partners the increase in the salary of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the issue of increasing the salary of the Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs needed to be resolved urgently in order to make the post more attractive to potential candidates for the reopening of the tender.
Next week, we'll also be discussing the change in the terms of the tender.
The Minister also stressed that she had no specific candidate in mind to be interviewed for the vacancy.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that Inga Kolegova, head of the State Environmental Service, would have been a good Director-General of the Ministry of Environment.
As regards the current acting head of the VIS, Dasi Peleko, who has indicated his willingness to run for the post, the Minister reiterated his view that the new Director-General of the VIS should be 'from a distance' and should not come from within the VIS structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the return of the Saeima from leave to push through the amendments to the law needed for the reorganisation of the VDI as soon as possible.
BNS has already informed that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, has submitted a request to the Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), withdrawing her candidacy for the post of Director General of the Ministry of Environment.
In her talk, she said that it was not an easy choice, but that during the past two weeks, her relatives had experienced severe emotional distress, even though they had not committed any legally punishable acts.
Kolegova also stated that the discussion of her candidacy had increased the contradictions between the parties of the ruling coalition, which was also unacceptable.
It was also reported that the former Director-General of the ILO, Inara Peterson, had resigned at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock indexes in the United States and Europe are rising, as is the value of the U.S. dollar.
Oil prices continued to rise on Friday morning, with investor sentiment boosted by comments from the Saudi minister of oil, which reinforce expectations that major oil-producing countries will meet at the OPEC meeting in September to stabilize the world oil market.
The three major U.S. stock indexes hit record highs on Thursday, not seen since 1999.
The main positive market factors were the increase in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
Rising oil prices and strong financial performance by several companies on Thursday also led to higher European stock indices.
The US dollar appreciated against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen on Thursday.
The New York Stock Exchange's WTI crude oil price for September deliveries increased by $1.78 to $43.49 a barrel on Thursday.
Brent crude oil prices rose by $1.99 in October on the London Stock Exchange to $46.04 a barrel.
The turnover of the canning company Blue Lagoon for the sale of shrimp is 33,8%.
The turnover of the canning company Blue Lagoon last year was EUR 4,202 million, which is 33,8% less than a year earlier, while the company's losses decreased by 5,7 times to EUR 904,7 thousand, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
The Commission notes that the Bank's shareholders have not been able to fully recover the assets of the Bank since the end of the financial year.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase large quantities of cheaper raw materials and to obtain volume discounts.
The withdrawal of the banks concerned from the Latvian market also led the company to implement projects supported by the European Union Structural Funds, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise its infrastructure.
The financial developers of the company were also negatively affected last year by the increase in raw material prices and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
The Commission notes that the Commission did not take into account the fact that the price of the product concerned was lower than the price of the product concerned.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
The investors have already visited the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
This plan included improvements and optimisations of technological processes that would lead to higher production productivity and capacity.
'Several equipment was purchased to increase the production speed,' the company management stated.
The management of Blue Lagoon notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will enable the company's plant to fulfil orders that were not possible before.
The first production batch to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the sales of the product have already been subject to the intent protocols, all production will be sold in accordance with the intent protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by around EUR 300 000 per month", the company's management states.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement for the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
Blue Lagoon has shipped its first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded its niche market to Cyprus and will sign a partnership agreement with a new supermarket chain in the US in September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted to the airport in the form of a loan from the State to the airport operator.
Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 with a share capital of EUR 1,156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian private individuals, Mihail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igor Širshon (10,89%).
Welcome to the 15th floor of the museum to meet the film giant Zare Leander and attend the press conference.
Riga is considered the birthplace and inspiration of the iconic film star Zara Leander.
Zara Lander's courtship with her stepmother Ruth, who was the wife of the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, in Riga in 1924, proved fatal, because it was she who discovered the unusual low control of Zara Leander's woman, which she applied when debuting on the Riga cabaret theatre stage.
Perhaps the accidental drought in Riga became a fateful turn in Zara's creative path against world fame.
Riga Zarah Leander had fond memories and hoped to visit Riga in a holiday party, but unfortunately these hopes were dashed by the outbreak of World War II.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at the Riga festival 2016 and the role of Zaras Leander will be played by the great Eva Kerievica.
There are extensive traffic restrictions in the Aglon area.
In order to ensure the safety of the participants of the celebration of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, from 12 August at 17.00 to 15 August at 18.00 the transit of freight cars will be closed on several state highways in the Aglona district, the Latvian State Roads Agency informed.
Aglon festival participants and public transport will not be affected by these restrictions.
It should be noted that the construction works are taking place on the section of the P62 motorway from Kráslava-Přeli-Madona to Kráslav station (0,80.-4,00 km) and that only public transport and pedestrians will be able to cross the construction site during the Aglon holidays.
The other road users will be provided with a bypass route, as shown in the attached file.
Traditionally, large numbers of people, including pilgrims, attend these festivals.
Drivers should therefore be particularly vigilant as there will be intense pedestrian traffic on the various motorway routes in the direction of Aglon.
We encourage drivers to be discerning about the traffic restrictions imposed, to observe traffic rules and to take into account the maximum possible time spent on the road.
The water temperature in all the water reservoirs has dropped below +20 degrees.
The water temperature will continue to fall with the passage of time, and it is currently below +20 degrees in all rivers and lakes, as well as in the sea, according to data from the Latvian Centre for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
The sea water has cooled to +16...+18 degrees, the water temperature has fallen to +13 degrees in places due to the wind on the west coast of Riga Bay, and to +9 degrees in Riga.
The water temperature in the Vltava and the Danube, as well as in the large lakes, is +18..+20 degrees, in other water bodies +14..+19 degrees.
The water temperature in the rivers and lakes reached +24...+25 degrees on August 12, and the warm water on the southern coast of the Gulf of Riga was up to +22 degrees.

Kurdish activists occupy the building of the German public broadcasting organization.
A large group of 30 Kurds stormed the WDR public broadcasting building in Düsseldorf on Thursday evening for a nearly two-hour protest, German police said.
Protesters who arrived with carried posters chanted slogans in an attempt to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
Officials say the demonstration was generally peaceful and protesters eventually left voluntarily after workers requested it.
The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers on a flight cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If insurance paid travel insurance to a family for a cancelled flight at Riga Airport on Wednesday 10 August, which had to cancel the planned visit to a music festival.
On 11 August, If Insurance received a claim for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but because the flight at the airport on Wednesday was cancelled, the client was charged a fee for the hotel reservation, which could no longer be cancelled, and for the tickets purchased for the festival, which amounted to EUR 204.
The airline has promised to reimburse customers for the money they have spent on airfares.
If insurance of all travel insurance premiums has paid compensation for interruption or cancellation of travel on average 15%.
"In such cases, the costs of purchasing, returning or exchanging tickets and booking accommodation are reimbursed", says Dagnija Rutka, head of risk insurance for persons at If Insurance.
As reported, on the evening of 10 August, a private aircraft stopped at Riga Airport due to technical problems on the runway, so only several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
A man is forced to leave his home because of a neighbor's repairs.
On the LTV program "Study 4", Dmitry Saidyachev spoke about his neighbor who has started a major renovation of his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been afraid of the roofs and is not sure if it is safe to stay in the apartment.
The problem is, my neighbors have volunteered to build, and my apartment has a broken ceiling.
Then I informed the city building commission, the building manager, and other organizations.
The city said we're not an operational service and we don't have any experts.
"The owner of the house has to go to the Latvian Union of Engineers, and there will be an expert there", Dmitry explains.
The expert who had been invited came and observed what had happened and admitted that the coating was in an unsatisfactory state.
But a month has passed since Dmitry's first application to the building board, and as of early this week, no one has been able to answer whether his presence in the apartment is life-threatening.
The government said, "That's the law, if you're not satisfied, write to everyone".
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Hall, but they sent it to the building manager, then the building manager went back to the construction company, and then there was a traffic jam", Dmitry relates.
From all the paperwork, it's clear that the construction is stalled, although you can hear someone working there every now and then.
The expertise was to be carried out within two months, and the owner of the apartment, who was carrying out the repairs, was to have all the defects fixed within six months.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, which the construction authority considers incomplete and excessive.
The expert did not indicate whether the metal bearing in this support structure was damaged, and therefore there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"We have therefore requested further explanations from this expert", says Ilze Zuka, a representative of the Riga City Construction Authority.
Despite the ban on any repairs to the upper floor, the building keeps on going.
The penalty for building without a building permit is between EUR 70 and EUR 700, but in this case the penalty can be considerably higher.
While awaiting the expert's opinion, the construction authority has decided that both the apartments cannot be used - both the one where the construction is taking place and Dmitry's apartment.
"This is an unprecedented case in the construction industry where, in this way, the residents, through their ignorance or simply unwillingness, may have created a threat not only to their property but also to the owner of the underlying property, resulting in the owner not being able to use his property", says the construction company representative.
Now Dmitry has to find a new place to live - with friends, at a radio station, in a hotel, or in a rented apartment.
But the damage that is done can be taken to the neighbor by civil procedure, which can take a long time.
Due to the construction work, it is currently forbidden to stay in both apartments until the building engineer gives his final approval, which may take up to three weeks.
The damage will be reimbursed by the owner of the apartment where the repairs were carried out.
The owner of this apartment is also facing a prison sentence of up to six months for ignoring the construction authority's request.
Take it now!
How many leopards in this picture?
The correct answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white lions were born in the Demidov Zoo near Kiev.
Everyone feels good and sometimes they even get angry with each other, even though they feed the babies together.
The conversion of the former Khmer sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost EUR 22 million.
The transformation of the former Kemera Sanatorium into a five-star hotel Park Hotel Kemeri will cost 22 million euros, Gita Želve, representative of the manager of the future hotel SIA Park Hotel Kemeri, told LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the renovation of the former sanatorium in Khmer.
The second phase will be a wellness clinic, scheduled to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the former Kemera Co-op Clinic building, which has an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of Park Hotel Chemeri and the proposed clinic is the international fund G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
G Capital Europe is owned by several investors who have invested in the fund, according to Želve.
As George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, has previously stated, the planned investment in the establishment of the former coastal outpatient clinic is between EUR 12 and 15 million, with a total investment of more than EUR 30 million.
It has already been reported that the Department of Tourism plans to raise EUR 14.5 million from the European Union funds for the renovation of a cultural and historical park covering an area of more than 42 hectares, the reconstruction of access roads and street sections, the construction of an interactive natural tourism facility, the redevelopment of the area and the construction of a parking lot in Emil Dārzins Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of Jurmala and the increase in the number of tourists.
The design work is scheduled to be completed by mid-2017, while the construction and refurbishment work will start in the autumn of next year.
The historic Kemeri Sanatorium is reportedly to be the site of the five-star Park Hotel Kemeri and a wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction will take time.
The 2010 report further stated that Ominas is in regular communication with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide daily technical controls at the Kemeri spa, and that the 'reconstruction of the Kemeri hotel in the making will be completed' in 2011 and that preparations for the opening of the Kempinski hotel chain will be started immediately.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Kemeri confirmed its willingness to buy the Kemer Sanatorium property in an auction held by the insolvent Ominas Latvia, but a month later the auction was declared invalid because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the stipulated time.
The sale price was set at the opening price of the last unsuccessful auction, EUR 2,86 million.
As the Latvian news agency LETA was informed by the City Council spokeswoman Ieva Aile, the municipality confirmed that the support of the European Union Structural Funds co-financing will be used to repair the historic Kemera Park, create an interactive nature tourism site, and to repair roads and parking lots.
The President will present the three-star medal to the late Antonenko.
President Raimond Vejonis will next week, August 16, present the Order of the Three Stars to the third-ranked officer, Alexander Antonenko, according to the presidential agenda.
The award ceremony for the Order of the Three Stars will be held at the Blackpool House at 1 p.m.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from the Joseph Medin College of Music in 1998, where he learned to play the flute and learned to sing with Margarita Gruzdeva.
Studied at the Vocal Department of the Latvian Academy of Music under Josep Vítol in the class of Arvid Lustes.
In 1997, he began singing in the Latvian National Opera choir, but in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in G.F.Hendel's opera "Alcina".
She received the 2003 Grand Prix de la Musique for her vocal performances in opera and in Verdi's Requiem.
It is indicated that in the 2004/2005 season he became the most internationally recognized Latvian tenor, engaged by the world's major opera houses.
Since autumn 2004, he has sung at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf, the Berlin and Graz Opera, the Semperoper in Dresden, the Royal Opera in Oslo and Stockholm, the Covent Garden Opera in London, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Vienna State Opera, as well as the Geneva, Dresden and Düsseldorf Opera and the Salzburg Festival.
Antonenko made her debut in 2009 with great success in the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince in Narnia.
In 2011, Antonenko sang the title song "Otello" with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Paris Opera, at the Covent Garden Opera he sang in Ludwig's "The Village" youth study, and in Stockholm he participated in Christoph Loy's study of "The Girl from the West".
A year later, Antonenko performed the role of Othello at the Covent Garden Opera in London.
Former NATO commander Bradlow's e-mails were hacked by Russian hackers.
Hackers who hacked into the computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out a number of other cyberattacks, including hacking into the emails of former NATO European Commander Philip Bradley and the Open Society Servers of the George Soros Institute, the Bloomberg Business News Agency reported Thursday.
The hackers published the information they obtained on DCLeaks.com.
It also contains a list of Brydlow's works and information on the work of the Soros Institute.
The hackers have had access to the Institute's computers for a year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same hackers linked to Russian intelligence agencies who hacked into the DNC's emails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama is considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the DNC computer hacking.
To impose sanctions, the administration would have to officially prosecute Russia or Russian-backed hackers for hacking the Democratic Party's servers.
The website WikiLeaks reportedly released some 20,000 emails in July that were extracted from the DNC computer system and revealed that Democratic Party leaders were trying to hurt the campaign of former Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic nomination for the presidential race.
According to US media sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the hacking of the Democratic servers, and other US intelligence agencies believe that Russia's involvement in the cyberattack is almost undeniable.
McCartney: The presence of Yoko Ono was a threat to The Beatles.
Paul McCartney admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono created a sense of threat to the legendary band The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star is currently on "good terms" with the widow of the late John Lennon, but at the time she was visiting the band in the recording studio, she was afraid of McCartney because Ono was the only female member of the group - between George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When asked about the relationship, the singer told Rolling Stone magazine: "It's really good".
We felt threatened at the time.
She was sitting on the amplifiers while we were recording.
Most of the group couldn't stand it.
We did, but not very well, because we were very stressed.
We weren't sexist, but girls didn't usually come to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John started seeing Yoko, she wasn't in the control room. She was in the middle of the four of us.
The "Yellow Submarine" writer also admitted that he now regularly contacts former bandmate Ringo, and occasionally approves Apple's recording studio work plans, but anyway the Beatles are "finally working".
Asked if he was still seeing the only other living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Not often".
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to meetings, and I feel a little bit off.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
Instead, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying, because I can't stand sitting at that table".
It was too painful, like watching your pet die.
The company now operates on the premise that I will only listen to all the recordings.
I'm part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus was once a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Research have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, which has a hot surface, no water, and an atmosphere almost entirely composed of carbon, has ever experienced conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' dense atmosphere explains its slow rate of collapse.
But recent simulations suggest that Venus once had a flat, Earth-like atmosphere, and it's been slowly rotating.
The models also look at the early topography of Venus.
The planet had more dry land than Earth, but it had enough water and geographical diversity to support life and prevent water evaporation.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
The GISS model of the rotation of Venus shows that the bright part of the day lasts for two months, explained Antonio Del Genio, a GISS scientist, in a press release.
This process warms the planet's surface and causes matter to form thick cloud layers that act as a rain-guard, shielding the planet from the sun's heat.
The result is a temperate climate, which is actually several degrees below the temperature of the earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution that scientists have hypothesized.
Although once habitable, Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for billions of years.
The oceans were boiling, and the volcanoes were being burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When the water completely evaporated, only the flat carbon dioxide atmosphere of the deadly greenhouse gas known today as Venus remained.
The scientists published the results of a new climate model for Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche.
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy filed a motion to dismiss, citing insufficient influence on the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sacks confirmed the news and announced that the club would begin a search for a new head coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been energetic, passionate, and determined in my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Hockey Club", said Roy, 50, in a statement.
I've spent this summer thinking a lot about how I can improve the team's performance, give it the brilliance it needs and achieve results at the highest level.
To achieve this, the visions of the Head Coach and the Vice President of Hockey Operations must be fully aligned with the visions of the organisation.
He must also be able to influence decisions concerning the performance of the team.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sack, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sack said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14, Roy was named the league's Coach of the Year and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the playoffs, Colorado was defeated by Minnesota, who had not made the playoffs in two years.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season 39-39-4 and five points behind the Wild, failing to earn the Western Conference's second-to-last invitation to the tournament.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and go on strike
The strike over the pay of workers on the North Sea oil platform has been called off as negotiations between the two parties have resumed, negotiators say.
There are regular strikes against the oil refining company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platforms where the company Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The joint statement stated that the Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions had agreed to resume negotiations on a settlement of the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are planned in the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, with the aim of reviewing the issues at stake.
The unions announced that their recent measures, organised after a gap of more than 25 years, are aimed at a planned 30 percent wage cut.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group reduced the wages of workers in the North Sea by 9% this year.
The company already reduced the wages of the land-based workers by 10% in 2014.
The company explains that the additional salary reductions would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell has already cut salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to cease oil and gas operations in 10 countries to optimise its operations in preparation for a large-scale merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by the UK's decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier this week, Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met with labour representatives to discuss one of the most important issues: the plans for the North Sea strike.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not individuals.
In 2016, almost USD 1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, compared to USD 7 billion invested in the last five years.
Kepler measured the rate of collapse of stars in the Pleiades star.
The new Kepler mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the speed at which stars collide in the Pleiades star.
The new data help astronomers to understand why the stars in this galaxy rotate at different speeds and how the rate of star collapse is related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with those of other stars, we will gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the mass of stars, their age, and even the history of the solar system", said Louise Rebula, a scientist at Caltech's Infrared Process and Analysis Center in Pasadena, California, in a news release.
The Pleiades star is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this galaxy are just beginning to grow, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They're spinning at full speed.
At their maximum speed, these growing stars emit a large amount of stellar wind.
When the worms enter the magnetic field of the star, they slow down the star.
As stars age, their rate of collapse decreases.
Kepler measures the rate of each star's collapse by determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable star region, such as a solar eclipse.
The latest catalog of stellar rotation rates shows that larger stars rotate slower than smaller stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, and the larger dancers are doing their pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
Rebull says that in the Pleiades "ballet", slow-spinning objects are larger and more massive, while fast-spinning objects are very small stars.
Because of its proximity, Pleiades serves as a great space laboratory where we can compare the properties of stars with their rotational velocities.
Rebull says that the Pleiades star helps to build theoretical models of the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have much to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down and stop completely.
Rebull and his colleagues have detailed their analysis of the rate of collapse of the stars of Pleiades in three new publications that will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
