China strongly opens U.S. adoption of the “Taibean bill”
China strongly opens the U.S. adoption of the so-called "Taibean bill", which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communications.
This was stated by the official representative of the Chancellor of the State Council of China for Taiwan matters Ma Xiao Guan on Friday.
The approval by the U.S. Senate Committee on International Relations of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and a brutal intervention in China’s internal affairs.

China must and will be united.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by any and any forces, Ma Xiao Guan emphasized.
TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok has been censored by a video referring to Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence, or the Falun Gong religious group, the Guardian says.
In the documents found to the publication, it is said that the owner of TikTok (the ByteDance company) through the app promotes China’s foreign policy goals abroad.
The majority of the violations concerning China’s policy falls under “the burning of hatred.”
In each case, TikTok places unpleasant publications in a context suitable for the general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the prohibition of criticizing the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of “critics or attacks on the politics and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”
The prohibition of mentioning the incidents on the Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under “the story of China or other countries.”
The document also contains a list of the forbidden names of twenty "foreign leaders or government officials", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Pak Qin Hi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are deleted by social network administrators and may result in the blocking of the user.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by the TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance's representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation and also attract independent local professionals."
The Russian users of TikTok have no specific publication limits, says the co-founder of the "Producer Center" Rustem Bogdanov.
The "Producer Center" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" agree with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without agreement.
Asked whether it is possible to talk about politics or Putin in TikTok, Bogdanov responds affirmatively and says he has seen such publications.
With Bogdanov, the founder of Our Didgital agency, Roman Zaripov, agrees: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you cannot expose shocking content, discriminating statements, and so on."
But under these rules you can submit any content that does not like the moderators, Zaripov notes.
The Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
By user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over the age of 13.
Social network administrators check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neuroset analyzes the face and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov tells.
If the neuron network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to the RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the coworking WeWork.

Russia warns of false calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from scammers that replace the bank’s phone number has increased.
This is by "Kommersant" with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted information to communications operators about more than 2,5 thousand numbers from which they called to customers of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a number replacement.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases the use of financial services was restricted.
The Deputy Head of the Department of Information Security of the Central Bank, Artem Sychev, said that a broad circle of Russian banks was confronted with the change of the number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the Central Bank’s warnings about fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such obligation in the “Communication Act”.
In the Opening Bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank confirmed information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a number replacement.
As in the press service "Billana", part of the information about fraudulent calls, which the Central Bank transmitted, was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to failures in the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a base of fraudulent numbers, to which the communications operator will address at each call to check the number.
He explained that to create such a base it will need to make amendments to the legislation.

According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, RT writes.
Crimea proposes alternative course to NATO
The President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky instead of the course to join NATO is worth engaging in establishing good neighbourhood relations with Russia.
This was on Friday, September 27, by the Co-Chairman of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinec.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat the errors of the predecessor, but it is worth listening to the [US President] Donald Trump's advice, which he has listened to with an acidic face, and establishing relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinec told reporters RIA Novosti.
Chegrinec noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, remaining in power to the Ukrainian president will only succeed in the event of establishing relations with the Russian Federation.

Barcelona has chanted Neymar
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to resolve the financial dispute that arose after the attacker's transfer to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost came to court, but the Catalan proposed the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise they refuse to return.
Neymar and his intelligent father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, set an interesting focus: according to an agreement with the Barça, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to get 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forward was in the PSG for a record of 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from Catalonians and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not much, the Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him even interests for the delay in payment.
When in the capital of Catalonia it became known about Neymar's claims, Barcelona sent a meeting lawsuit.
The "Blue Granate" insist that the bonus was relied on the execution of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that only a quarter of the 40 million euros were borrowed to the player and requires the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neymar and Barça almost agreed on the return of the “fake” player to the lone of Catalonia.
Indeed, the deal broke down, but the hope of the backward forward remains.
And here, as Sports.Ru reports with reference to the insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the question of financial claims will not be put in prejudice procedure, it will exclude the possibility of the return of the Brazilian.
Neymar himself so much wants to return that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

He thought he could claim a bag, as the first began to hunt in the waste.
The men began to dispute.
Suddenly, Beverly took the wagon and fled with it to his home.
Then Miller took the Samurai sword they found in the same dog and began to pursue the opponent.
He reached Beverly near his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knives and began to spread them toward the thief of the car.

Mass disorders on three
The "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protests the further, the more noticeable it is broken into separate fragments and loses political enforcement.
The evidence of the fact of “mass disorders” does not stand out to check, but in the absence of a political decision to drop this case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the accusations.
The dissolution of the matter must encourage society, but it will surely leave in extreme irritation the forces, whose efforts to fill the matter with figures and evidence have been useless.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of three remaining in the case accused by article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorders) - Alexey Minaylo was suddenly released from prison without any obligations, and a few hours later and completely rehabilitated: the Criminal Code removed the charges from him.
Minaylo was arrested for two months, and several professional communities immediately followed him: historians, priests, writers.
After this in the case remained only two accused of participating in mass disarmament (initially accused was 13): Sergey Fomin, transferred to domestic arrest on 3 September, and Samaraddin Rajabov, whom the court extended the arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of the use of violence against a representative of the authority, article 318 of the Criminal Code).

Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia proposes punishment for insulting police on the internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the law "On the Police" in order to protect the guard of order from the spread of insulting and detrimental information on the Internet.
On Friday on the federal portal of regulatory legal acts appeared a request for public discussion of the bill, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The document is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from “the dissemination in the information and communication networks, including on the Internet, of information of a disturbing nature, including discrete nature.”
How exactly it is intended to protect the police from cheating on the network, is not clear.
The provisions of the amendments will be applied "by the way of individualization of the mechanism" already provided by the law on the blocking of positions offending the representatives of the authority, and the law on the penalties for such positions.
Both laws entered into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and independent anti-corruption examination.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the law "On Police" should enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law on punishment for "open dishonesty to the state" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource of the infringement and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions a fine is provided in the amount of 30 to 300 thousand rubles, and for the repeated violation - administrative arrest for a period of up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this norm to the media, blocking the Jaroslavsky edition 76.ru.
Shortly after that, the Chudovsky district court of the Novgorod region punished the local resident by 30 thousand rubles for placing on the network “two records with information in unsuitable form that offends human dignity and public morality and expresses manifest disrespect to society, the state, the bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation.”

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to extend youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
One of the most famous is the peanut butter.
But phytoestrogens are not well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all beans (the most popular is soya), chmel, linen seeds.
However, many experts believe that such AUDs cannot be a complete replacement for natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additives cannot be excluded.
For example, on the background of their intake, the production of their own hormones can be reduced due to the fact that too many analogues come into the body from the outside.

The Hydrometecent called true people's signs
There are many people in Russia who try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
In the Hydromet Center, we checked all the signs that were supposedly working.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can be truly trusted, indeed, in a short-term period.
According to the scientist director of the Russian Hydrometecenter, Roman Wilfand, if the sun is red in the time of sunset, the next day will be really warm, as our ancestors noted.
And if the heavens were white, then the next day will be rain.
The second work point is based on the observation of birds.
More often, they talk about spots, if they fly low, then it is usually to rain.
This is simply explained - when the humidity of the air is high, the mosquitoes moisturize the wings and the pearls are forced to fall down to hunt insects, TASS writes.
On different continents there are popular signs.
The Sark Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated every year on 2 February.
It is believed that this day you need to observe the surk coming out of its nore to determine the time of the coming of spring.
Unrecognized oil spots found on the beaches of northeast Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The waves of pollution were dispersed on two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
The reports of the first oil spots discovered began on September 2nd.
However, every day, until Thursday, their number, like the territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Environmental Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turned out that all of them are identical and it is about raw oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, to which the samples were transmitted to the analysis, said they do not match the oil produced from the fields in Brazil.
“This is thick oil.
It can be thrown out of one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do that.
And most likely it has fallen into the oceanic flow," said to the Brazilian news portal G1, the coordinator of the trade union of the oil industry workers of the states of Pernambuco and Paraiba, Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to throw waste into the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the northeastern part of the country, environmental defenders found nine sea scratches completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them were rescued.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environmental Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin the cleaning of polluted beaches.
And so far, the Institute’s experts recommend tourists and local residents to cross the oil spots side by side and alert about all the detected pollution points.

The Russians have nothing to postpone on their retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matvienko, believes that the Russians do not have sufficient assets to make the country fully effective the draft law on the guaranteed pension product.
The practice of raising pensions through personal savings is quite common in the world.
The other matter is how timely it is introduced to us.
“In my opinion, now a significant portion of the population has income, from which they simply have nothing to spend on increasing pension security in the future,” Matvienko said.
The Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms of forming and calculating the pension, since "continuous changes in this sphere have ultimately confused them."
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything we can to ensure that the pension size, the social security of citizens are improved.
But the steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account the domestic realities," Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
If this initiative (the draft law on the guaranteed pension product) will develop, it must necessarily be provided several basic principles, including volunteering, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the safeguard of pension accumulations.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation on September 6 announced the sending to the agreement of the bill on the guaranteed pension product (GDP).
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary order of the accession of citizens to the system of accumulations, the guarantee of the conservation of long-term pension accumulations of citizens by the state, the registration of accumulation accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for and tax withdrawals for citizens.

The expert tells me why you should give up tea in packages.
A group of Canadian scientists, representing the McGill University, found that when a cup of tea is cooked, more than 10 billion microplastic particles fall into a cup in five minutes.
In the packed drink can also be added particles of pepper, said Nation News food safety expert Elizabeth Tychonova.
According to the agronom, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
The peppers are not thrown out at the end of the season, so they may be in the tea.
“In addition, the packages do not always include the tea plants,” Tychonova said.
According to her, it is better to refuse to consume such a drink in favour of the tea for the dishes, which is sold in specialized stores.
Furthermore, she emphasized that the danger of packed tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, which causes them to begin to release harmful substances.
"The best thing to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink will be the least of the additives," the expert said.

Supplies of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times
The Russian government estimated that supplies of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo have decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to the report sent to the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries against 3 million 442,2 thousand tons in the similar period of 2013, reports Interfax.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226,5 million from $4 billion 975,5 million respectively.
It is about the supply of goods that are not subject to embargo.
According to the report, the falling amounts of prohibited products were compensated by increased imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until 31 December 2020 the deadline of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for imports to Russia within the framework of counter sanctions.
In the document posted on the official portal of legal information, it was noted that the period of validity of the rules was extended by another one per year - from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Initially the effect of the sanctions was extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine, joined this list.
Putin's decree on the destruction of the illegally imported "sanctions" (products falling under the food embargo that Moscow introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the government has allowed to destroy "sanction" food in any legal way.
As the sanctions of the West remained, the Russian Federation also extended its response measures.
At the same time, the measure does not apply to the products that citizens import for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation on the development of civil society and human rights Mikhail Fedotov previously called "simply immoral" the destruction of food, and this, according to him, has a negative impact on the education of people.
Moreover, with the initiative to ban the destruction of foods suitable for consumption, Rospotrebnadzor spoke in early June.
After this, the same recommendation was given to the government by the Human Rights Council at the President of the Russian Federation.
And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksei Gordeev said that destroying food is wrong, and it is necessary to think about how to use them as intended by evaluating quality.

Chile starts construction of a $1 billion telescope
This was by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
According to ESO, this week officially began the construction of the building, where the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) will be located, the most expensive and ambitious land astronomical project.
Its total value, according to ESO, will exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacturing of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-sized mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 six-angle segments of a size of 1.4 meters.
This enormous mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the Solar System, stars in other galaxies, as well as to find the Earth’s twins.
Additionally, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the building of the cup was just started, the mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other experts for three years - since the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, the total value of which was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
