Members of the Welsh House of Commons are afraid of looking stupid.
Some Members of Parliament are confused by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP, Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The uproar began with a plan to change the name of the House of Representatives to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the House, regardless of party affiliation, are concerned that the change could make them a target for ridicule.
A Labour Party spokesman said the group was concerned that the name rimmaa was being combined with the words Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales, in Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to one representative of the Plaid party, the majority of the group is 'not satisfied' and has proposed other alternatives.
The Conservative Party spokesman said his group was 'open minded' about the name change, but noted that the word MWP is a short word for 'stupid'.
In Welsh, the w is pronounced in this context in the same way as the U in Yorkshire English.
The Commission of the Delegation, which is currently drawing up the legislative amendments needed for the name change, stated: 'The final decision on the names of the members of the Delegation is, of course, for the members themselves.'
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the House of Representatives the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a survey of proposals which showed widespread support for the appointment of a representative to the Welsh parliament.
The Commission has preferred the honour of Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP for short, but the MWP option has received the most support in the public opinion poll.
The Members of the House are apparently proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus may cause a headache for the President, Elin Jones, who is expected to propose legislative changes within a few weeks.
The amendment legislation also contains other amendments to the functioning of the representative office, such as the rules on the loss of the office of representative and the form of the committee system.
In legislative proceedings, members of the House of Representatives may give their final vote on what title they should be called.
Macedonians go to the polls in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is aimed at resolving a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbour is in practice a territorial claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are going silent as Harlem's churches are going through a difficult time.
"The older people I've spoken to tell me that there used to be a bar or a church on every street corner", says Adams.
Today, there is neither.
He said it's understandable that the bars are going to disappear.
He said that "the way people interact has changed".
Bars are no longer the common living rooms of a neighbourhood where people gather regularly.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the sale of property is not going as far as the leaders imagine, and sooner or later they have returned to the starting point.
He added that churches can be replaced by residential buildings and apartments that are inhabited by people who are not the kind that would support the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
'The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,' he says, 'and thus they are hastening the day when these churches close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.'"
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins decades later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's took over the black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street in Harlem's central business district after they objected to hiring or promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's congregation planned to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the tower bells "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the tower clock in July called it another name: "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the world's first bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, a complex community has developed in St. Martins, with architects and contractors hired by the Episcopal Diocese and secular church leaders.
In July, Germany, the governing body of the parish's lay leaders, wrote to the diocese expressing concern that the diocese was "trying to pass the costs" on to the diocese, even though Germany had not participated in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some congregants complained about the lack of transparency regarding the hippos.
A shark has injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California .
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving lobsters on the opening day of the California lobster season.
The attack happened at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he and his friends were diving for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and a group of others lurched to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited about catching the lobster, but then he realized that the lobster was screaming: "I'm going to get bit!"
I was bitten!'
When Hammel arrived, he found that the boy's entire collarbone had been torn open.
"I called everyone out of the water, there's a shark in the water!"
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was deemed to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to his upper rib cage.
Authorities have closed beaches from Casablad's Ponto Beach to Ecinitas' Swami for 48 hours for investigative and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's intends to enter the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to a department store style beauty salon with expert advisors.
This is a major step for the UK's £2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow despite declining fashion and home goods sales. Larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, will be expanded to other stores next year.
The investment in beauty products is driven by the fact that supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double its range of beauty products to 3,000, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space and will have their own brand-specific areas, like Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup range, with the majority of products going vegan-friendly as young shoppers increasingly demand it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop is testing out rental stores at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
The shift from online shopping and food shopping to small one-time purchases at local stores is forcing supermarkets to find new ways to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain battles cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food items.
Since acquiring both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores, plus Habitat stores, which it says has boosted food sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how the profits from the supermarket pharmacies should be shared.
The new strategy follows a takeover where Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand its range of luxury skincare products to four stores under brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: 'We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are ready to advise clients.
Our range of brands caters to all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient location make us a compelling beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones in the space shuttle after Holly Willoughby withdrew from an £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left in a fit of rage as TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their household goods and housing brand Truly.
The twins' company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute, and now plans to focus on his new signing deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "in a rage" last Tuesday at a tense meeting at the Jones business empire's headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, after the TV star admitted that her new £1.5m deal would not leave enough time for their household goods and home brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrowin's Goop brand, and was betting twice as much as Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in a state of shock.
No one believed Tuesday's events so close to publication.
Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.
The This Morning presenter is one of Britain's most lucrative stars, and experts say his departure could cost the company millions in investment in products ranging from pillows to candles to clothing to household goods, not to mention delayed release.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby organized Capp's Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
Couples are vacationing together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is being named as the new brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said the night before that we're commenting on his business.
A tough talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for his comments, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, and his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said that while pretending to be a news anchor.
I never gave up.
He noted Kim's interest in meeting again after Trump had hailed the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But the nuclear negotiations have been a mess.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
He said the United States would instead continue its sanctions, which are intended to keep the pressure on.
Trump had a much more optimistic view of the world in his speech.
"It's going great with North Korea", he said.
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship.
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have been successful, with the cessation of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more people out in this crowded hall, we'd have about 200 people standing right there", Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated island, hundreds killed
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
A national emergency requiring international assistance was not declared, even though some 10 percent of Lombok's residents had been left homeless.
'In many cases they have unfortunately made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging', said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is a traveling group in Palu, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work at the airport.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pong to see if international organizations would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face natural forces, given the regular earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely caused by a tsunami warning siren that was missing, even though the warning was in effect.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging even in the best of conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the Lombok earthquake is on its way to Palau, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's decaying infrastructure a focus of his election campaign, and he has poured money into improving roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko has been plagued by a budget deficit as new elections approach next year.
Adding to the pressure is interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where the country's Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christian and Muslim gangs have engaged in street fighting with knives, arrows, and other primitive weapons, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 people and the displacement of tens of thousands.
Look at Liverpool 's Daniel Sturridge , who scored a late equaliser against Chelsea .
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the Premier League defeat on Saturday, scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was hit by Xherdan Shaqiri 27 yards from Chelsea's field as his team was in the goal-losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before he threw a terrified shot at the back of the back.
The shot was floating high over the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
Finally, the ball landed over the pitcher Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, I took one hit, and I fired without thinking too much.
Chelsea took the lead at half-time 1-0 after Belgian Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues centre-half gave Mateo Kovacic a free kick in the situation before spinning away near midfield and spinning into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic was a fast-pitch center fielder.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a stunning pass.
Hazard escaped from the defence and passed Liverpool's Alison Becker with a left foot shot in the corner.
Liverpool will face each other in the Champions League group stage in Naples on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are playing in the UEFA Europa League against Videoton on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said early Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo told a news conference that many were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, raising waves as high as six meters.
The debris from the collapsed buildings was scattered widely throughout the city of Palun, which has a population of 380,000.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was found stabbed to death.
The body of a woman found this morning in Birkenhead on the Merseyside has launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking anyone who's been in the area to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Crime Commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on video on the dashboard to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation.
A female police spokeswoman has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, a group of people who may have known the woman came to the scene of the crime, asking where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they're working to notify the victim's family of what happened.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
She was speechless when she learned what had happened.
Residents have just been told it could be hours before they're allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene at this time.
A woman appeared at the scene, crying.
He kept saying, "It's terrible".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two landings in the isolated area, and outside, there was a third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area, guarding the apartment building.
Anyone who knows anything is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using code 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament was also part of a rewrite of history.
The removal of the statue would be a poetic justice, given that his own fanatical Puritan supporters destroyed England's cultural and religious relics as did the best of the Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "tyranny" and "a rewrite of history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues would make a target for the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell might suffer the consequences of the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell reflects 19th-century views and is historical evidence of a character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more so in the 19th century than today, regard Cromwell as the defender of Parliament against external pressure, which, of course, in this case was caused by the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain, at least, is that the dispute of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell must be recognized as the figure who represents the other side of that division.
Moreover, his achievements as a public administrator deserve to be praised and remembered.
A Chinese farmer was killed by a killer shark
Local media reports that a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
The body of a man identified only by his surname Yuan was found near a pig market in Liupanshu, Guizhou province, with a ruptured artery and blood all over his body, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pig farm preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs at a market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door to the nearby pigsty unlocked.
In the wilderness, he said he saw a large ram with a mouth full of blood.
According to the news, a forensic investigation has confirmed that a farmer killed a 250-pound sheep.
The Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named Wu said that my cousin's feet were bloody and bruised.
CCTV footage shows a cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market's managers told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and Tory officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans before, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had squeezed a Welsh farmer's tractor, until his wife managed to scare the animal away.
A farmer in Oregon was forced to eat his pigs in 2012, and after the incident, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that although pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They are like little children, very curious, and they do not intend to hurt.
They just have to be respected properly, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States .
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, the pink will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The storm reached its peak winds of 125 feet per second, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was located about 400 miles [620 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The roses are expected to move north on Sunday.
As low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean and heading eastward along the west coast of the United States, as Rosa hits the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters [0.5 inches] of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching low tide, will form large areas of rain to the southwest.
Locally, rainfall of 25-100 millimetres causes dangerous flooding and potentially landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall of 50 to 75 millimeters an hour in certain areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas in the southwest, especially in Arizona, rainfall is expected to be as high as 50 to 100 millimeters.
Heavy flooding is possible and conditions may deteriorate rapidly due to the dispersion of tropical rain.
When tropical rain is threatened, it is strongly recommended that you avoid walking into the wilderness.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms create local gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than 10 millimetres is possible, causing small flows of waste and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain of the rainy season in the region.
Scattered tropical rainstorms begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, the United States can see strong fluctuations in temperatures throughout the country as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
The central United States is a prime example of the large temperature differences on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, and between Nebraska, St. Louis, and Des Moines, Iowa.
The lingering heat of summer is set to intensify and expand again in the coming days.
Early October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures reaching +26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures may rise to +26 degrees on Tuesday, about 4 degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term forecast is that the eastern United States has a good chance of higher than average temperatures in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing .
More than 20 million watched a six-channel broadcast Tuesday in which Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of a sex crime in the 1980's, gave their fascinating testimony.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued as the television companies suspended their broadcasts with a last-minute twist that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations under a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that a drunken Kavanaugh had grabbed him and tried to strip him at the prom.
Kavanaugh, for his part, gave a sensitive testimony in which he said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
The number of viewers was likely higher than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other channels broadcasting the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring the number of viewers who watch in offices.
Some of the proportions tell us that the number is the same as the number of people watching a football game or watching the Oscars.
Of all the television companies, the highest viewership, according to Nielsen, was at Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
Friday night's drama was centered on Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras captured him being escorted by protesters as he made his way to the Justice Committee hearing on Friday, after supporters of the moderate Republican had previously announced he would vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed live how he stood for minutes staring down at the flares flying.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he'll tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are weak", she was told.
Mr Flake said his office had issued a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks were live as the Judiciary Committee began voting to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate floor.
Flake said he would only act on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was convinced in part by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, based on discussions he had with him.
Flake made his decision after consulting with Coons and several other senators.
The fact that Flake was elected was a powerful one, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for Brexit policy
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accuses those who criticize her EU plans of pursuing policies that threaten Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has been quoted as saying that the EU is "a very important partner in the EU" and that the EU is "a very important partner in the EU".
Police arrested Dytheon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of an LSU football player .
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing 20-year-old Wayde Sims while playing basketball at LSU.
20-year-old Dytheon Simpson has been arrested and taken to the county jail, where Baton Rouge Police Department says he's charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of Sims and Simpson's interrogation, in which police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB reports.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde during interrogation.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate magazine.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency would like to thank the Louisiana State Police task force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspects.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "distinctness and justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-3 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that he was "appalled and devastated" by the death of Wayne.
"You always fear something like this will happen", Wayde said.
The volcano is spewing ash over Mexico City .
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached residential areas south of Mexico City.
On Saturday, Mexico's disaster prevention center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as activity intensified and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded over the course of 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in residential areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have detected increased volcanic activity 72 kilometers southwest of the capital, Mexico City, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists gather before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the split-vote.
Police detained a group of masked independence supporters who threw police with eggs and powdered paint, which formed dark clouds of dust on normally tourist-filled streets.
As the day progressed, more crackdowns broke out as the police used their batons to contain the daggers.
The clashes between the pro-independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetting, no forgiveness" and the latter shouting "long live Spain".
Local media reports that 14 people have been treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tension is still high in the pro-independence region a year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal but which the Catalan separatists are celebrating.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although turnout was low when the opposition boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities say that almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed outdoors on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest was organized, but it had to go the other way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
Last year, we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we're stuck", he says.
Despite the modest but vital victory in the regional elections in December, the momentum of the pro-independence parties in Catalonia has been waning this year, with many of the most prominent leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a pro-police protest on her phone, says politicians on both sides have fueled the controversy.
"The situation is getting worse", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been under investigation since last year, announced his intention to contest next year's European elections.
'Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the undermining of democratic values and the repression we have seen at the hands of the Spanish government', he says.
Londonderry: two men arrested after a car crashed into a house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was reported to have repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 PM UK time.
Crime Commissioner Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
The car may have been fired at some point with a crossbow.
Livingston beat Rangers 1-0 with a goal from Menga
Dolly Menga 's first goal in Livingston secured the win .
The series-winning Livingston stunned Rangers, causing Steven Gerrard just his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal was enough to win the game as Gary Holt's team moved into a tie for second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team have missed out on their first away win of the season in the Premier League, and next Sunday they face Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them.
The Rangers are going to face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has continued his unbeaten streak in the series, now six games behind, and head coach Holt has yet to lose a game since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost places to a visitor who was suffering from a lack of a blade.
Holt should have led the team long before he scored after causing the Rangers a lot of trouble with his straight.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and then Alan Lithgow slipped in with a field goal to Craig Halkett's buckling pass, but he missed the ball.
The hosts were so generous in handing over control of the ball to the Rangers, knowing they could vaccinate for special occasions.
The important goal came exactly like this.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free-kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson gave Menga a spot, from which he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had the ball by then, but found the home team's defense holding, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely allowed to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to turn it down.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's attempt and Lithgow passed the ball in yet another special Livingston situation.
The focus on the Livingston penalty area was constantly being cleaned up, and two occasions where a penalty kick was required, Halkett's tackling of substitute Glenn Middleton and a ball in his hand.
That was a great performance by Livingston.
The BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and were excellent with every player, continuing through the ascenders.
The way the team plays and the crew have changed little since their return to the top flight.However, Holt should be recognised for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing in leading a superbly organised defense, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall at his feet the whole game.
The Rangers, though, were short of ideas.
The team has occasionally performed very well under Gerrard, but now it was far from his standard.
The last inning was a bit of a stretch, and they only managed to open the home plate defense once, which should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
A smile was tender and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements on human rights and freedom of the press as well as Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, citing security concerns, but many supporters still gathered nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The competing demonstrations reflect the division of opinion, with some Turkish Germans hailing him as a hero while others denounced him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford, motorcyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:00 a.m. local time in southwest Deptford near the busy intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street.
The driver of the car pulled over and paramedics came to the victim's aid, but he died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist was killed in a traffic jam on Childers Street, about a mile [1.5 km] from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
City police say they're working to identify the man and notify his loved ones.
Roadblocks have been imposed, buses have been diverted, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lart prison six guards injured in riots
Prison officials say six prison guards were injured in the riots at the high-security men's prison.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 on Sunday, British time, and is still ongoing.
Tornado Special Forces have been deployed to calm the unrest, with eight prisoners on board a prison ship.
The police officers suffered minor facial injuries and were treated at the scene.
A prison administration spokesman said: "Special trained prison staff have been dispatched to HMP Long Lart to deal with the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may spend longer behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reportedly hospitalized in June after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In addition, riot police were alerted to the prison in October because of serious disturbances, with the staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical low tide is a rare occurrence in Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwest desert, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy flooding Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The outbreak is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving in the form of rain on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical storms have maintained a tropical storm or low tide within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest modeling from the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall of 50 to 100 millimeters, and in some places, it may reach 150 millimeters at the Mogollon Range in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, are actually producing 25 to 50 milliliters, with some areas receiving as much as 100 millimeters [0.4 inches] of rain.
Rainfall can also be a blessing in a drought-stricken area, provided there is no danger of heavy flooding.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rain may be beneficial, since the southwest has suffered from severe drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Bureau, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first make landfall on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
Sunday morning, Rosa, 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, is still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, moving north at 20 miles per hour.
A storm loses its strength when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico as a strong tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, heavy rains can cause significant flooding.
"From the California peninsula to northwest Sonora, 75 to 150 millimeters [75 to 150 inches] are expected, with a potential of up to 250 millimeters [250 inches]", reports weather.com.
Rosa then continues its journey across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border at tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning, from where it continues its journey through Arizona south to Utah by late Tuesday.
"The greatest risks of the storm or its remnants are associated with extreme rainfall in the California peninsula, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern U.S. desert", says the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause deadly floods and sewage flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack, four arrests for attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to a hospital where he is said to be in stable condition.
Police say they have arrested overnight a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset.
Police are requesting that anyone who may have video footage of the incident be contacted.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party's "cold and angry" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to the charges at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's excellence, creativity and courage that day.
"This vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time, with outstanding merit in public service", he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
I didn't just campaign, I campaigned to the fullest, he said.
That's why I'm going around fighting for the perfect candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats had made it their mission to "resist and prevent".
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first major vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected in the Senate by Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people died after a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, wiping out many as giant waves washed ashore.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Puget Sound on Friday when waves as high as 20 feet [6.5 m] hit the beach at dusk, washing many to their deaths as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami caused an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still crowding the beach and did not immediately flee, leaving them victims, says Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's National Disaster Management Bureau (BNPB) in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses and hit all over the country", says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami reached a speed of 500 miles per hour (800 km/h) on the high seas before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palus.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) issued a statement saying that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the terrain of the town at the end of a long, narrow bay could inflate the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims had been found in the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater than Pallu, 300 kilometers north of the coastline, in the area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications are completely cut off and there is no news of Donggala, says Nugroho.
The Red Cross said it had more than 300,000 people living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floors of a building is furiously shouting warnings of an impending tsunami to people on the street.
Just minutes later, a wall of water hits the beach, taking away buildings and cars as it goes.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut communications around the Pohon, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say the army has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by transport aircraft, but evacuees still need food and other basic items.
The city's airport has reopened for relief operations only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Pyongyang on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's Donggala staff have reached the city of Palun, where they are housed in tented bunkers in the office's courtyard, and on their way past the scene of the disaster, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he says.
It's really bad.
As the aid groups embarked on their disconsolate task, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palau.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin to flow once the accident area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", says Aulia Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made".
As another night descended on the Pulu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing were reviving the hope that their loved ones would miraculously depart from the dark story of natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team, had trained two missing gymnasts for the Asian Games earlier this month.
Mandagi said his students were also trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel.
"As a senior member of the Rifle League, I have my own emotional burden", he says.
Gendon says he tried desperately to reach out to the beach festival's competitors via WhatsApp after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread among the social media community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one gray sign appeared instead of two blue ones.
"I understand that means the messages were not delivered", he says.
The thieves took $26,750 from a cash-filling ATM in Newport on the Leve.
A Brink's security employee was robbed of $26,750 on Friday morning while filling an ATM at the Newport on the Leve, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying and filling an ATM at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When the Brink's employee's attention was distracted, he ran after her, who stole the money that was supposed to be delivered.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but police did not specify their number.
Anyone with information regarding their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The character formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a nickname for 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album called Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who according to the show's creator withdrew from the show for 'emotional reasons'.
West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him as well as being an abbreviation of his professional name.
In discussing the album's title earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said that he believed that ye is the most common word in the Bible, and that it means sin.
So it's you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kany, which means unique, and ended up in the shortened form of Ye, which just expresses the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is mostly a reflection on who we are.
He's one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his favorite names Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner, JAY-Z, has also removed and restored the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians, announcing the announcement as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of retaliatory measures against students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared in Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, vowed that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Armed forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people during a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by offering monthly tuition and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities were driving young people into criminal gangs.
The EU should double funding for AI research
The United States should double its funding for AI research as China ramps up its efforts in the field, says AI financier and mathematician Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by statements on AI from various parts of the US administration, although the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year to become the world's leading AI developer by 2030.
'Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI', says Lee.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI breakthrough will be in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book, "The AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a publishing house.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest-rated Othello player in the United States.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. administration's previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to recognize future visionaries.
Lee says the U.S. researchers have worked hard to get the government to fund the study.
"Academic influencers are not taken by China, they are taken by big corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been recruiting top universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to improve its AI efforts.
'I think that people who have a PhD in AI should be automatically granted green cards', he said.
The Chinese government announced its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is poorer in China, Lee said.
The Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center earlier this year to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, for its part, invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the draft law on the creation of a national security commission on artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the 'Republic of North Macedonia', a name change that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked the country's bid for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, considers the name of its northern neighbour to be a territorial claim on its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on the new name proposal, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the anti-vote campaign raises doubts about whether voter turnout will reach the 50% threshold required to make the result legal.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?'
Those who support the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying for Macedonia, which emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to seek both EU and NATO membership.
'I came here today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us', said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said they respect the outcome of the vote to have a decisive impact.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66% of eligible voters voting in the end.
'I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe', said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would pave the way for NATO and EU membership.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of the tents being set up by the boycotters of the referendum outside the Skopje parliament.
'We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the kitchen door,' said Kavadarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us in Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, as part of the integration of the euro area.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of the name change, as over 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that the "Kky" voice is "the way of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated 30-43% voter turnout in the referendum - below the required level.
In a second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote for the yes option.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for a Western-oriented government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has beaten the whole Brighton defence with a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have made their mark on Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his goal at the 65th minute look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the game, the Argentine star hit a home run in the middle of the field.
He found an empty field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one defender and then left several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English top scorer used his first touch inside the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who passed Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero is having trouble with his legs.
We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored in that time.
However, Sterling had already given the blue team an advantage in the league championship.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in a situation deep in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a nice pass on the left flank.
Sane made a few touchdowns before sending the ball to Sterling's backside.
The Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before the home run.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be the party-breaker in the game against the Rockies .
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why force a starting lineup?
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to take the field for the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies still have a losing record, one win away from the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Conference.
The Rockies at least caught a wild card with a 5-2 victory at Nationals Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division title.
Even though we don't have a stake, we can at least get on the pitch knowing that the vibe of the crowd and the other team here in Denver is creating the most demanding competition setup I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take the challenge?
The Nationals haven't released their starting pitcher for Sunday, but the data shows they're inclined to give Scherzer a shot under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who missed the practice session Thursday, would play his 34th game in the opening round and pitch Sunday at his normal resting position.
The Washington right-hander has a win-loss ratio of 18-7 this season, an ERA of 2.53, and has struck out 300 batters in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is running for office in West Virginia.
The President was referring indirectly to the situation of his nominee for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
All our achievements are at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
This is one of the really great -- I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning in full force, and that's why I'm going around to fight for the great candidates", he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and their malice.
They don't choose who they hurt or who they have to hurt to get to power, what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them.
He said the Democrats had made it their mission to "resist and prevent".
"And it's been visible for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and mean and lying".
When he referred by name to the longest-serving Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, the audience responded with loud bows.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
Well, uh, no, wait a minute. That was really bad body language. Worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerant parish.
It doesn't tolerate those who say what they think.
I wasn't really surprised when the activists in my local Momentum party voted for a motion of no confidence against me.
After all, I'm just the last Labour representative in line to be told I'm not welcome just because we're saying our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated the same way only because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said on Friday that we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour representative, the Friday meetings of the party council have been just that.
Now many of the meetings do not follow that tone, and the policy of 'more friendly and gentler' has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is clearer than ever that the Labour Party no longer tolerates dissent and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This started soon after Jeremy became the CEO, and colleagues who thought I shared the same political views began to expect me to make a complete change and take positions that I would never have otherwise agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a barrage of insults on social media demanding that I withdraw my election, reject centrist politics and I get to hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am indeed more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made to me are at least political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults every day and never waver.
The normalization of ill-treatment is one of the most disturbing features of contemporary politics.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party of differing opinions, and with every motion of censure or amendment to the electoral code, the party is only more limited.
For two years I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that 'everything goes well'.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago in the wake of the Thatcher government's neglect of the school, I have worked as a city councillor and as a minister to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency has been surprised by my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I want to say that as the government moves towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not see the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honour, and the threat of dismissal or advancing my political career will not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr - Melrose 38-17 undefeated at Ayr
The two last-minute goals slightly distorted the result, but Ayr undoubtedly earned the victory in the day's entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Ayr are now top of the table as the only team out of ten to have never lost a game.
A great defense and a better chance of success was what ultimately kept them going, and Coach Peter Murchie can be happy for a reason.
"We've been challenged in our matches and we're still unbeaten, so I can be satisfied", he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, "All credit to Ayr, they took a better risk than we did".
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute with a goal from Grant Anderson and a successful conversion kick from Frazier Climo, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Roy Hughes, who was given up for the Warriors, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty, and just before half-time, he scored and succeeded in a conversion kick to increase Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well with a goal from Patrick Anderson, whose conversion shot Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
The match was delayed for a long time when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried off the field. As the game progressed, Ayr increased their lead with a goal from Stafford McDowall, which Climo managed to convert.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, after which Bruce Colvine of Melrose scored a goal after a hard-fought conversion kick which failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored on a side-goal pass from behind Ayr's goal.
Climo managed to convert the kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and cleared Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
The star of the Still Game series starts in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company, which will also launch his career in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC programme he is writing with comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The Twins have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' final, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning her life after Craiglang.
According to the public records, he is listed as a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself declined to comment on the details, but a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's booming restaurant business.
"The sea is ours": Inland country Bolivia tries to regain access to the Pacific Ocean through legal means
The Marines are patrolling outside the naval base at La Paz.
The flags of public buildings are flown with a mermaid flag.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon are dotted with the slogan: "The sea is rightfully ours.
It is our duty to get it back.
Inland Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource war is still strong  as is the longing to sail the Pacific once more.
The hope is at its highest for decades as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a strong belief in progress, a spirit of unity and composure, and of course a positive attitude in the face of a final solution", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians around the country are watching the International Court of Justice's decision with hope from the big screens, hoping that the conclusion of decades of disruptive debate in The Hague will uphold Bolivia's position that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
The charismatic Bolivian president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, has a lot at stake in next Monday's lineup.
"The return to the Pacific is very close", he assured in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch-based UN body has no jurisdiction to hand over Chilean territories, and the ICJ has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is issued only six months after the last opinions were issued suggests that the case is "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed rather than promoted Bolivia's goals.
'The current Bolivian government has hijacked the issue of maritime connectivity', said Zárate.
Morales's disagreeable rhetoric has stifled the rest of Chile's goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations after that.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally swift.
He said Monday would give Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit".
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
A decision is an opportunity to realise that it is time to move on from the past.
North Korea announced that it will not denuclearize unless it can rely on the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless it can rely on Washington, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Ri's comments come just as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume deadlock diplomacy on nuclear weapons, just three months after the US met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
He said it was a "distant dream" to believe that continued sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Until Pyongyang has taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is cautious about adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up its arsenal, which the state likely sees as the only real way to ensure its own security, has been widely questioned.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest in a line of large-size headdresses, soon to be on your street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
In a showcase of their SS19 collection, designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of unique oversized headgear that would shine a light on the Paris fashion week.
Highly impractical headgear took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino's most eye-catching creation was a beige hat with a wide quill, which covered the heads of the models almost entirely.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon adorned with jewels, a magic hat, and even a pineapple  but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of quirky masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips, and they were more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creature, with a snorkel and mask, was more like a diving gear, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big-size fashion, you're in luck.
Fashionists predict that giant scarves are about to appear on the street.
The oversized hats closely follow "La Bomba", a half-meter-long straw hat with a sash, seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult image of the impractical hat, which was rife on social media, also swept up the second-sized creation in fashion shows  an oil-based beach bag that is almost as big as the model wearing it.
The most eye-catching creation of Jacquemus' SS19 collection at La Riviera at the Paris fashion weeks was a raffia bag lined with burnt orange ribbons and white leather sleeves.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm sure I'll see large hats and beach bags on the street next summer. Designers have made such an impression that it's hard to ignore the demand for large outfits".
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizenship
The Scottish private schools have traditionally had good learning outcomes, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results, reinforced by individual and community success in sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
These over 30 000 pupil schools, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Authority (SCIS), are located across Scotland and aim to provide a high level of service to their pupils and parents.
Private schools seek to prepare their students for their chosen career, for further and higher education, and for world citizenship.
As an education provider capable of designing and implementing tailored learning content, we have seen the status of languages as a preferred and desirable subject in schools continue.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, the message goes into their head.
If you speak to a person in his or her own language, the message will reach his or her heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build trusting relationships with people in other countries.
The latest test results for this year show that languages are at the top of the list for pass rates among private schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved the highest A grade.
Data were collected from 74 SCIS schools and found that 72% of pupils who achieved the highest A grade studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools are supporting foreign language learning as an essential skill which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but are treated as subjects of equal value with science (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment Office found that 17% of situations where an employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore all the more essential for promoting the future career development of young people.
The more language skills are required for possible jobs, the more essential these skills become in a global world.
If a person has studied a second language, he will have an advantage in the future in this lifelong skill, regardless of the career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts the language proficiency person ahead of the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey found that of the more than 4,000 British adults, 75% could not converse in a foreign language, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit figure of 15%.
This is why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowledge of languages, especially in developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful careers.
Within Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are supposed to be important to British people in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there are always a number of language options in private schools, taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At the same time, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages will continue to be of great importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to provide this freedom of choice, diversity and high standard for young people in Scotland.
I'm not going to do it.
John Edward is the Director of SCIS, the Scottish Independent Schools Board.
LeBron is making his debut Sunday in San Diego .
The wait for fans who have been waiting for LeBron James to make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in a preseason game.
But how many minutes he actually plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play the remaining minutes.
James, who has been watching practice, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six games ahead.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare", he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign time, his YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins his campaign today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump campaign events planned for next week, including favorites like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While awaiting a vote on his choice of Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy, Trump is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing their congressional majority in November.
What time is Trump's campaign in West Virginia today, and how are you going to watch it online?
The Trump West Virginia Wheeling event is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign event online as a live stream on YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will take his stand this week at the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing, which has been heated by sexual harassment allegations that have delayed a Senate confirmation vote since a week of FBI investigations into the charges.
But the primary goal of the campaign series is to support the Republican candidates' success in the tight November election.
Thus, the purpose of the five-week campaign of President Trump is to "incite willing and supportive Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so essential to his agenda that the president is willing to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign period", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The venue for today's event is the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and there may be supporters from as far away as Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit in a month to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is backing Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who has fallen behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is trying to increase his support in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows a fighting will to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the four-game Saturday afternoon was just what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-reinforcing power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this one.
Where is this force for success, according to them, at this time?
"They had a six-point lead, which narrowed down to four, so we take this success as a hippie", said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, the advantage: four points ahead and 12 to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in their sails and a lot to encourage, like the fitness of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play together all day and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been a powerhouse from brick to green, and he's leading by example.
The thunderous throat sounds of the victory celebration intensified as his lap progressed as he managed to hit a critical hole to tie the game at four with him and Thomas two points behind on two holes.
The putt that they won the 15th game was followed by a similar cry, which gave the impression that he believed that the U.S. team had not yet lost.
"You have to focus really hard and just worry about your own game", Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed Ryder Cup legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's quirky but sweet double has won four of the four without a single mistake.
The only other pair that didn't do a bogey on a Saturday afternoon was the Moliwood, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and receive energy from this bustling crowd, confirms that they are the Sunday pre-favorites, and when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there could be no other more popular player to secure a possible European victory than Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather have both at the same time, on different tracks.
The talk of European success is premature, of course.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, paired with Alex Noren, the hero of the morning's four-game series.
One bogie and two double bogie on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep that they were nowhere near survival.
Although, on Sunday, no one will be there to help you out of the hole.
Quidditch and quadruple play are fascinating to watch closely from the perspective of couples' cooperation: what advice they give or don't give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, taking a considerable lead before the last day, but this quadruple showed that the United States team has a fighting spirit, even though it was suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe is in a good lead ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup after taking a 10-6 lead over the United States in fours and fours on Saturday.
The brilliant pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over the spiky Tiger Woods, and raised the score to four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, struggling to hold on to the victory they lost two years ago at Hazeltin, managed to take the weakly-footed United States team to a 3-1 lead in the morning quadruple sculls.
The United States were the toughest opponent in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow their lead.
Jim Fury's side needed eight points from 12 double plays on Sunday to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points.He and Molinari, also known as "Molliwood", were the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four games after a sensational weekend.
After crushing first in fours and Patrick Reed, they then finished the overwhelmed Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through two games on Saturday, was at times very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 fights in quadruple and foursome, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning's fours, but returned to fours with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a quick 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fours, and later a 4-3 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team moved from four points behind to level at the start of a double, even though Fury's side also has enough to keep the win.
However, after two days of second best, it may be that the Sunday counterattack is too much to ask.
North Korea will not disarm without trust under any circumstances.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions only increase mistrust in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant benevolent measures" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and pledging that North Korea would not increase its nuclear weapons or technology.
'We have not seen such behaviour in the United States,' he said.
 Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the preservation of national security, so in such circumstances it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally.
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaint that Washington would not accept a phased nuclear disarmament with North Korea being rewarded for every intermediate step, his statement is significant in that unilateral disarmament was not completely ruled out, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Mr Ri referred to the joint statement by Mr Kim Jong Un and Mr Donald Trump at the first summit between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In the statement, Mr Kim assured the Korean peninsula of denuclearization and Mr Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed any easing of the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States is demanding disarmament first", he said, "and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposing the peace declaration".
The idea that sanctions would bring us to our knees is the hope of the indifferent.
But the problem is that continued sanctions only deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: 'If the disarmament demanding party had been South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such a deadlock.'
Yet Ri's tone was markedly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the US's missile targeting of continental regions was inevitable after the "evil" President Trump called Kim a "suicide-minded missile man".
Last year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, but this year, Trump praised Kim for his courage in approaching denuclearization, but stressed that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
Yet, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and unfailingly until we witness a complete, final and confirmed nuclear arms reduction".
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of curbing Pyongyang's financing of ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Mr Pompeo met North Korea at the UN General Assembly in Rhineland-Palatinate and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go smoothly.
On leaving Pyongyang, he described the progress made, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like" demands.
North Korea pledged to close the missile base and nuclear facility in a meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in case the US takes "corresponding action".
Mr Pompeo said that Kim was referring to the "comparable measures" of security guarantees promised by Trump at the Singapore meeting and the move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a course on adequate rest
All undergraduate students at Harvard University are participating this year in a course designed to increase student rest, a counter-culture to the university's burgeoning macho culture, where students press long nights on the strength of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of the basics of their own well-being.
The course's designer, Harvard Medical School professor Charles Czeisler, who works in sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, "Why am I only hearing about this now, in my final year of college?"
"No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I thought was surprising", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, will guide students on how the right habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of medicine at Harvard University and vice president of health services at the university, says that the university decided to organize the course after hearing about students suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows students a picture of a living room where they can click on coffee shops, curtains, sports equipment, and books, thus learning about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance, and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section explains to participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that this has no immediate impact on student behaviour.
However, we believe that they have a right to know about these matters just as they have a right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Czeisler added.
All-night college marathons are still a matter of pride, says Professor Czeisler, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Getting enough and quality sleep should be a student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a hunger-like state in the brain, which causes a person to be constantly hungry", the professor notes.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes as a freshman at Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course that would cover all students on campus.
He hopes that all postgraduate students will be able to complete a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm clock to remind them of the bedtime, in addition to waking them up in the morning, and that they bear in mind the negative effects of electrical displays and LED lighting on circadian rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers , the shot of Menga took the victory from Gerrard 's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day as Dolly Menga's shot through the broken defence brought Livingston a 1-0 victory.
The Ibrox players were looking for their first win since February's 4-1 win over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard suffered only his second defeat in his 18-game managerial career, with Rangers eight points behind the reigning premiership leader Hearts.
Menga kicked the ball seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' dropped fighting spirit did not ease the situation any further.
Rangers dropped to sixth place, while Livingston has climbed to third, with only Hibernian ahead.
The Rangers may have other problems ahead, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when he was hit in the head by an object thrown from a visitor's center, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the line-up that had beaten Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the Livi 11 formation, which took the team's point from Hearts last week, and the same strategy again produced results, as the well-built formation managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
While the Rangers were able to dominate possession, Livingston was better off using the situation to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score in the second minute, when Menga's first innings gave Scott Pittman a free pass to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free-kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to make a wide field goal to the back of the net.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but there was no confidence in the air in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a penalty when, at the fifteenth minute, he and Steven Lawless had collided, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was able to repulse Lassana Coulibaly's puck and Ovie Eyar's weak shot.
Livingston's 34th-minute goal was an unexpected opening, but it wasn't just the team's hard work.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long passing tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly passed the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
In the second half, Gerrard decided to trade Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field, which affected the game almost immediately, as Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos, but the attack interrupted Kelly's influence on the fast defense.
Livingston put the visitors back in their own game, as Lithgow and Halkett continued to pitch long in succession.
Holt's team had a chance to increase their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense thwarted Jacobs's intentions before Lithgow could get into the corner.
Rangers' newly traded Glenn Middleton also demanded a penalty kick after a fight with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
The Almanac: The inventor of the Geigermeter
Next page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany on this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the development of what later became known as the Geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the metric became a central concept in pop culture.
What the hell is that?
It's a geiger detector, used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.
Evans: "Look, now it really does crack!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer test can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves isolating immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to "see" proteins typical of many cancers.
The vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, a patient with ovarian cancer lost cancer cells within 18 months of receiving a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method is to isolate immune cells from the patient and modify them in the laboratory to detect HER2 proteins typical of several cancers, and then inject the modified cells back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: "Based on our results, this is a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancer", explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and cancers of the ovaries, lungs and colon".
A similar approach  taking immune cells from the patient and training them to attack cancer cells  has also been successful in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was getting a lot of criticism for praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West got a bang on his neck on Saturday Night Live after he lavished praise on President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election.
After performing the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, dressed in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
I often have conversations with white people and they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, he says, he'd have moved out of America a long time ago.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch by Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was related to Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's stunt wasn't aired live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a clip of it to social media.
It's unclear whether Rock intended to mock West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been mistreated on set because of the hat he wore.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they'll say I'm a marginalist, West says in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see what it means to be marginalized?" and says he's going to wear a Superman cap because "at that time you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love.
According to Variety, West's comments caused the audience to shudder at least twice, and the show's performers appeared embarrassed.
West was cast on the show on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many audiences by performing "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who praised her courage on Twitter: "WITH HUMAN BROTHERS".
But then Karen Hunter, the talk show host, tweeted that West is just being herself, which is great.
However, I can choose NOT to be a supporter of a person (by buying their music or their clothing brand or by supporting their "art") who I believe is supporting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us, he added.
The rapper announced on Twitter before his performance that he had changed his name to "The Person" formerly known as Kanye West.
West is not the first artist to change his name, but the musician is following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to Symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant burglar charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident happened in the Ballyhackamore area.
The accused is due to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
The star of Game of Thrones , Kit Harington , is attacking the toxic masculinity of the game .
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in the HBO crime fantasy series Game of Thrones.
Harrington, however, has attacked the stereotype of the macho character: the 31-year-old actor says such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by hard work.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural section, Harrington suspects that something has gone wrong and questions the current means of tackling toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harrington, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, also a member of the Star Guard of Game of Thrones, admits that he has a strong desire to get involved.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is something that I feel strongly about right now", he says.
What have men been taught during their formative years that has led to the problems now being observed?
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: "What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be a certain kind of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time  how can we change this?
I mean, there's something really, really wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series ends next summer, because he has, in his own words, "gotten enough of the battlefields and the horses".
In November, Harrington will appear in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, about a film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his future wife Rose was the best thing Game of Thrones has ever offered him.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on", he says.
Rose Leslie played Ygrit, the love interest of Jon Snow, played by Harrington, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has seen a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
Some 40 000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to the country's conservative values, 7090% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many infections are due to insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to ensure universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the Republican senator who leaked the employee's information and accuses her of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied on Saturday allegations that her employee had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about them.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were being spread by "extreme right-wing" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgraceful lies", Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Among the information released were the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and of Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was released by an unknown person Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a Senate committee hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the Hill newspaper said the messages were posted from an IP address associated with Waters' office and by someone on Waters' staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie", Water continued.
 My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false.
Waters's statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile", Fleischer wrote.
It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to act hostile.
There's no reason to be defiant.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
The situation should be managed with restraint and calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican nominee Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters' seat in the congressional by-election, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"I can't believe this is true", he tweeted.
Waters said in his statement that he had contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies in response to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for any and all destructive and dangerous acts against any or all of my staff".
Johnny English strikes again in an underwhelming parody of Rowan Atkinson's agent.
It is already a well-established tradition to look for references to Brexit in any film that is a bit British, but this does not seem to fit with the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in the 2011 sequel Johnny English  Reborn.
Can the tongue become Britain's new national export success from a satire of a nation on its cheek?
In any case, the blind, the gullible, the incompetent Johnny English has already earned his license to re-create the show, which, as its name suggests, is a comic creation aimed at the non-English-speaking film market.
It's, of course, that silly secret agent who's desperate to breathe in the glamour that's melting around him, but turns out to be a mix of inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and that unfortunate one-note musician at the 2012 London opening.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mystical man of the world who left behind a sheer chaos, originally portrayed by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last show has its moment.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter in medieval armor, and the rotor beams are waving at his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy gifts come to the fore, but the humor itself seems inefficient and strangely unnecessary, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Dangerous Mission now provide humor as a core part of the film's content.
The humor seems child-oriented, and the crazed treatment of Johnny English doesn't strike me as as inventive and sharp-sighted as Atkinson's Mr. Bean silent comedy.
The starting point, which is repeated every year, is that Britain is in the worst of trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and is revealing the identities of all British agents in the field to the dismay of the operative agent, in what is presented as a pitiful little role-play by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the important and promising Prime Minister, already in the grip of political disapproval: Emma Thompson is doing her best to parody Teresa May, but the script just doesn't give her enough space.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all spies in the field have been exposed, he must call in someone who has already retired from active service.
It's, of course, the grumpy Johnny English in his own person, spending his retirement days as a fine-school teacher, but also giving informal lessons in the fine art of espionage, and the subject of some clever jokes, English keeping School of Rock-style lessons in the halls of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he is reunited with his endlessly patient fighting partner, Bough, still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role as Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to be getting in her way.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to Her Majesty's Secret Service to face the deadly super-criminal Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, played by Jake Lacy, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough's odyssey quickly turns into a farce: two waiters set fire to a fine French restaurant and cause chaos while secretly trying to steal Volta's luxury yacht.
Even the last obstacles of the actors are crumbling as the final scene approaches, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little child-oriented.
You can keep the movie in moderation.
I've seen Johnny English movies before and I've come to the same conclusion: why is it that the British film industry is unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that will do justice to her talent?
The British Labour Party rejects plans for a four-day week with a five-day wage
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week but be paid five days a week.
The party is reported to be demanding that business leaders transfer the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers in the form of an extra day off.
The plan would allow workers to enjoy three weekends at the same wage.
Sources say the idea "would fit" with the party's economic program and plans to tilt policy in favour of workers.
The Central Federation of Trade Unions supports the move to a four-day week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times newspaper: "We were informed of the revision of the lineup before the turn of the year.
The change will not happen in an instant, but the four-day workweek is an objective that fits in with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers and with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the UK Green Party pledged to support the move to a four-day workweek during its 2017 referendum campaign.
But the objective will not be given unshakable support from Labour.
A Labour spokesman says: 'The four-day workweek is not the party's line and the party is not considering such a move.
The Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, John McDonnell, used last week's working conference to present his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "unprofitable dictators" and "benefit-seeking corporate manipulators".
The plans of the Shadow Government's Minister of Finance meant that the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to recover their shares in full, as the Labour-led government could be forced to implement the "reductions" on the basis of the abuses found.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to employees' control, with a plan to pay an individual employee a maximum of £500 per year in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss on 60 Minutes whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The investigation into the charges against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the delay also raises questions about whether the outcome of the investigation could shake the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's nomination.
On Sunday's episode of 60 Minutes, the program's correspondent, Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it might be possible for the FBI to find out things that might change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I said when I got to the hearing... I said I'd had a discussion with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the charges came out, and I asked him if you knew about it.
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a rock.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's bomb-proof", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this:
None of the people he named could confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old case.
I don't see what could change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which is taking place in New York on Saturday, is a music event with a cast as powerful as its mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival draws tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York's Central Park to hear such performers as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the true purpose of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to eradicate poverty.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience must perform various tasks or acts, such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision-maker or making a phone call, or performing some other act that spreads awareness of the project's objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded, now that it is only 12 years away from the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert tickets a real way to get people to take action, or is it just one of many  clique-activism ideas that you can change the world by signing an email or tweeting?
Global Citizen reports that it has recorded more than 19 million actions for various causes since 2011.
It says that these actions have prompted policy makers to announce commitments and principles worth more than $37 billion, which have been used in ways that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations, on the basis of which more than $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most prominent commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to "helping children develop to their full potential". The group pledged to provide Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the country, after activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries and people like you, we can put the history of social injustice and malnutrition in the record books", Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also called on the UK government to take action to improve maternal and child nutrition with more than 5 000 actions, and announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project to tackle malnutrition, which will reach 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions on the FAQs on the movement's website is: How do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen's answer: The road ahead is long and difficult, and there are many stumbling blocks ahead.
But we will succeed, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will be leading the New York concert this year, and its line-up will include artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
The U.S. Department of the Interior says the country could hinder energy exports by using its navy as a barrier.
According to Ryan Zink, US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by the Washington Examiner, Washington can 'recourse to its navy if necessary' to prevent Russian energy from spreading to world markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's activities in Syria  at the invitation of the legitimate government  are a pretext for exploring new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the reason [Russia] is in the Middle East is to transport energy, just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern hemisphere of Europe", Zinken is quoted as saying.
The administrator stated that there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open with its fleet and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market", he says.
Zinke was speaking at an event organised by the Energy Consumers' Association, a non-profit group that profiles itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are one and the same.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is more or less speculation and replacing one fuel with another", he says, describing Russia as "a circus act of one trick" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The comments come amid a Trump administration effort to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To further this, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unconventional" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump says will tie Berlin to the Moscow subjugation.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the 110 billion cubic metres of transmission capacity of the existing pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's opposition is purely economic and is an example of unhealthy competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a backlash in Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial body, the Central Federation of German Industry, has urged the United States to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
'I find it very problematic that a third country is interfering with our energy supply', said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, is going to consider carefully running for President in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she will "carefully" consider running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed his consideration of running at an open polling in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our broken administration, and that means a woman at the head of the kingdom", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider running for president".
Warren was evaluating President Donald Trump during the event, saying that he was "taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he says.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet he posted on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday found that a majority of Warren's constituents did not support his candidacy in 2020.
A study by the Suffolk University Institute for Policy Research and the Boston Globe found that 58% of "likely" voters in Massachusetts are against a senator's candidacy.
32 per cent voted in favour of the proposal.
The majority of respondents supported the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates in the 2020 debate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will formally decide his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin referring to her son's war wounds at Donald Trump's election ceremony
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the Army in September.
Track Palin was arrested the night before Monday and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through when he comes home, I can relate to other families who are going through the effects of PTSD and the injuries our returning soldiers are carrying", she told an audience at Donald Trump's election in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest a "rush horse" in the living room and said his sons, like other war veterans, "are coming home a little changed, they're coming back hardened, they're coming back wondering if what he and his comrades in the Army and Air Force have done for this country is being respected".
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault, domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking to change the new policy in force in the United States that does not grant asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the federal district left a letter in Washington on Friday, supporting those seeking asylum who violate the line, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace v. Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He tells of being assaulted by his partner and his sons in his violent gang, and the U.S. authorities denied him asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutor who supported Gracie described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries where gang and domestic violence is a problem that is widespread at all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Asylum Appellate Body that undocumented immigrants had been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
In a statement Friday, Karl Racine, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle", says the letter.
The prosecutors also argue in the letter that the practice of blocking asylum seekers from entering the United States is damaging to the economy, as the newcomers are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring in the necessary additional manpower".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
'Asylum is for persons fleeing their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion' Sessions announced the new asylum policy in his statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems  even the serious problems  that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts continue in Palermo  The number of dead found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation will become more serious.
"The situation is very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is fever-ridden at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palun.
Ambulance teams are bringing in new bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their looted belongings, and try to save what remains to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are full of people who have been damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who has suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, are resting outside Palun Army Hospital, where patients are being treated for the continuous, powerful aftershocks.
His eyes fill with tears as he relates how a violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think. Harris reports to the Associated Press, and says he was in town with his family for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "provocation" by "propaganda ads"
The US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of the US-China trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid-for newspaper extension of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections, which China has denied.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to interfere in the US elections mark a new phase in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China, according to US officials speaking to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread propaganda to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an ever-escalating trade war, with both sides taking turns imposing tariffs on the other's exports.
Chinese and American experts say that China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were targeted at states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to American workers, farmers and businesses, Iowa a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China is now "increasing its provocations by publishing propaganda statements in our own free press", Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished traditions of free speech and the press by putting a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", writes Branstad.
"The differing opinions on the Beijing street newsstands, on the other hand, are limited, and the real, differing opinions that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming developments in their economy are not seen at all, because the media is firmly in the Communist Party of China's cronyism", he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that one of China's major newspapers refrained from publishing the offer for an article he wrote, but does not specify which newspaper.
The Kavanaugh fiasco is driving women voters away from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top Republicans are standing behind and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could cause a backlash, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections, analysts say.
The sentiment surrounding the case has been in high spirits, and most Republicans have already indicated they want to move forward with the vote.
"These things are irreversible", says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell Institute, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn't believe Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute offer to investigate the FBI will appease angry voters.
'Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or in November,' said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the national reform group MoveO, according to a newspaper published in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming" as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate Judiciary Committee as Republicans decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
'Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be measurable', says Stu Rothenberg, a non-committal political analyst in an interview with the news site.
People say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and it's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially for the nearby insecure female voters and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't often vote because they don't like the president.
Analysts are anticipating a possible backlash if Republicans move forward with confirmation even before Ford's deposition against the Supreme Court nominee, who made his sexual harassment allegations.
"This is going to be a mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on trial, it's about how the Republicans have acted and how they've treated Ford", Guy Cecil, the leader of the Democratic-supporting group Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided as to whether they should believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a slim majority leaning toward the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent say they think Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushed the case forward, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one other allegation made by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had molested him while he was drunk when Ford was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee revealed her gender at a college party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet in response to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt's goal is to "rule the world".
"It has to be done now", he said, referring to his startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data warehouse" or POD.
It may include contact lists, notebooks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available on one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal data repository is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "data-driven personal empowerment".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills required to bring Solid to everyone's reach.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some of the contracted developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website, all of which will be available starting this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to offer people a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We're not asking for their consent.
In an article published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's 'mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the integrity and quality of the new Solid network'.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will retain his position as founder and chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the city remembers the heroic priest of the First World War
The city is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the death of the only military priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross medal by the Church of England.
The Medal of Valor was awarded to Colonel-Lieutenant, Reverend Bernard Vann, for the events of the attack on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, Vann was shot dead by a sniper four days later, never knowing he had received the highest British military honor.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "impressively symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
Later he rushed to the front and "showing the greatest heroism" led the advance of the troops before charging alone on the field guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's work was "something I could never achieve, something that commands respect".
Michael Vann He landed with his brother Dr James Vann, arguing after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band's marching band.
Michael Vann says it is a 'great honour' to be part of the parade, adding: 'A great crowd is commemorating the honour of a true hero.'
The free-to-play fans were up all night waiting for the Bellator 206 tournament. The TV channel was showing Pippa Possus.
Imagine a situation where you've been up all night watching the highly anticipated Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event is not even shown.
The San Jose event featured 13 matches, including six main series matches, and was scheduled to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to go on the air, the show was turned into Pippa Piggy's big surprise for the audience.
Some of the spectators were not exactly happy to stay up all night because of the fight.
One friend of the wrestling event opened up on Twitter describing the replacement of the fight with a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
"The law said that the content was not suitable for 6 a.m. and they had to switch to a children's programme", explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communications at Bellator, about the switch.
- I'm not sure.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that the timetables will be worked out so that UK viewers can follow events in the future.
'I'm thinking of a rebroadcast that will probably get the show going,' Coker said.
However, it is six o'clock in the morning there, and we cannot have the program presented until Sunday of our time, which is Monday of their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program switched in their heads, messages started going in one direction and another and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the bug because we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case. It was a legislative matter.
I can promise you, next time, this won't happen.
We're limiting the number of games to five instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to offer our fans more, and we're trying too hard.
This is a tragic situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic swimmer and athlete Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says it was only when she came to high school that she realized that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, Daley said she spoke out for gay rights to give others "hope".
She also tells how after having a child winning at the Olympics was no longer so important.
The longtime radio talk show host Kristy Young has taken several months off due to illness.
When he appeared as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said that when he was young he felt "less important" than everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work".
She relates: "Till this day, these feelings of being less and different have been a reality and have given me the strength and energy I need to succeed".
He says he wanted to prove he was something so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and she's appearing at this year's Commonwealth Games to advocate for the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give hope to other people.
The three-time world champion tells of her falling in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 as a surprise.
Daley married this Oscar winner 20 years her senior last year, but says the age gap has never been a problem.
"If you experience so much at such a young age", she said. "She competed in her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later. "It's hard to find another person of her age who has experienced the same kind of ups and downs", Daley said.
The couple had a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, which has changed the perspective of Dale.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have been about winning a gold medal", he says.
You know, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about the 2012 Olympic tickets, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be around to be on the front lines", Daley says.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he really stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally realized he was not invulnerable", he says.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was something I'd dreamed of all my life, to jump in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling", Daley said.
This was also the inspiration for her first song selection on the show, "Proud" by Heather Small, which sparked emotions as she prepared for the Olympics and still gets her skin in the chicken.

Semi-conducted to the Mickelson bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will break the record on Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to peter out in a remarkable way to avoid the record-breaking round being a dismal performance.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was moved to the bench by captain Jim Fury for the four-ball and foursome games on Saturday.
The American five-time Major champion, who is usually the center of attention, now spent half of the day cheerleading and the other half on the field trying to get his kicks.
Mickelson, 48, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the peak of his career, is not an ideal choice for the tight Le Golf National, where the long-haired tough guy punishes for unreasonable hits.
If Mickelson's opponents aren't enough on the field, Sunday's ninth game will see the accurate British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays alongside newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who are aiming to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in 12 games, get a flying start, Michelson's game could prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else can be said in this situation?
"He fully understands the role he played today, he patted me on the back, rubbed me and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's undoubtedly one of the best players in the game and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I had other ideas, but this is how it went down and this is how we ended up.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else.
Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may also mark the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which never matched his personal accomplishments.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven-and-a-half, but Fury says his presence brings something indeterminate to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to make jokes at people's expense, and he's a funny guy that everybody likes to hang out with", he explains.
I'm sure the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week, too.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how quickly a long lead can be lost
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a major lead in the Ryder Cup before the final day's doubles can be a bumpy ride.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who managed to win with the lime lines just under his nose and won by the narrowest possible margin.
"It reminds itself of how we led strongly in Valderrama, we led strongly in Brooklyn where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit narrowly", Bjorn said after looking at the 2018 team's 5×3 wins both on Friday and yesterday, moving to 10×6 at Le Golf National.
History will show me and every other member of this team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a large caliber.
We're going to go out there and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we're trying to win that prize, and we're only aiming for that.
As I've always said, I'm focusing on these 12 players who play for us, but we are aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world.
Pleased with how his teammates have performed on a difficult field, Bjorn adds: I never arrow until I fall in such things.
Tomorrow is a whole different story.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on individual performances, and then we'll talk about different things.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're on the field alone, that's when your ability is tested to the core.
This is a message that must be delivered to the players tomorrow for the best performance of all.
Now we have to give up the partner, who can go [on the field alone] and do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Fury will be demanding better performance from his players as individuals than they were capable of as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk, for his part, has experienced the turning points of the last day in both directions, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before being eliminated when the European team won "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said, answering a question about how 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw had his team's lineup stretched to the final day's climax.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a fast start just like what happened in Brooklyn, or what happened in Medina.
When it gets moved in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We've adjusted our lineup accordingly and put the boys on the field the way we want, as you know, we're going to do miracles tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defense and will face Rory McIlroy in the most important game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter next in line to face their European opponents.
"I put the teammates in this order because I think it carries through the whole tournament", Bjorn commented on his two-game selections.
The new German warship is delayed again
The newest frigate in the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014, and is intended to replace the aging Cold War-era equipment, but will not be commissioned until early next year due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media report.
According to the military spokesperson speaking to Die Zeit, the commissioning of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, the "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery issues have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to the available information, they will be equipped with effective artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-surface missile systems and stealth technology, such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signals detection reduction.
The ship's important features include its longer service life  the new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without occasionally visiting home ports.
However, the continued delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships  purportedly intended to enhance German influence overseas  are already obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F-125 made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to officially take her into service and returned her to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but there has been talk in the German media of major "software and hardware" flaws which render the warship unfit for combat missions.
The software deficiencies are particularly significant because the Baden-Württemberg class vessels have a crew size of around 120, which is only half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's ability to upgrade later.
With a capacity of 7,000 tons, the Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the overall project cost is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to have risen to a staggering EUR 3,1 billion from the original EUR 2,2 billion.
The problems of getting new frigates into service have arisen in the wake of recent warnings that the German navy was shrinking.
The German parliamentary committee chairman for defence, Hans-Peter Bartels, noted earlier this year that the fleet's number of operational ships is "shrinking".
The authorities say that the problem has grown over time because old ships have been decommissioned but not replaced.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigate had been brought into service.
The Environmental Protection Agency is listening in on the hidden life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands is trying to find out how bats exploit the land to hunt for food.
The new study is expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to provide guidance on future conservation measures.
Researchers at the National Trust for Scotland are monitoring the Inverewe Gardens, a botanical garden in Wester Ross, for the presence of the dwarf and the black-headed bat, as well as the earwig and the water monkey.
The study involves the installation of special recording devices at important points in the area to monitor the activity of the bats during the season.
The organisation's staff and volunteers also carry out moving measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the sounds and the species concerned are confirmed by expert analysis.
The results will be used to create an ecological map and report, which will show the behaviour of bats in a diagram that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the organization, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how different species are exploiting them.
The information is useful in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of pastures and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout Great Britain has declined dramatically over the past hundred years.
Construction and land development threaten the bat's habitat and resting places.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet mice.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
Bats use advanced remote sensing techniques to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental organisation which maintains over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country  and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of resting places and, in some cases, animal rescue operations.
It has even established Scotland's first and only bat-only conservation area, at Threaven Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to the estate manager, David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats", he says.
We have old buildings and trees and, all in all, a good living environment.
Not all is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us to better understand what bats need to succeed.
He stresses the importance of inspecting buildings for bats before any renovation is undertaken, since the destruction of one bat's nesting site can involuntarily result in the death of up to 400 female bats and cubs and the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and their killing, harassment or destruction of their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Society, encourages the public to participate in conservation work.
He says: "We still have a lot to learn from our bats, and we don't know how their populations are doing yet".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegations against him as "fake news" and says people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to challenge the German newspaper Der Spiegel for the allegations it published.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for a non-disclosure agreement, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram live to his 142 million followers just hours after making the allegations. The 33-year-old football player strongly denied the allegations, describing them as "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
What they've said today, fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
They just want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's not a bad thing.
They want to be famous by using my name. It's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have called, according to Reuters news agency, "unwarranted reporting on privacy concerns".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is seeking compensation for "mental suffering in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan reportedly met at a nightclub and moved into the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99% a good guy" but that his "1%" was a disappointment.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken pictures of his injuries in hospital, but later settled out of court because he was "scared of the possibility of retaliation" and worried "of public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking a reversal of the plea because he is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to signing for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged Manchester United attack, and moved to Italian giants Juventus for $100 million.
Brexit: Britain will 'regret forever' the end of car manufacturing
Britain would be 'lost forever' if it lost its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was 'concerned' by the announcement by Toyota's UK unit to temporarily suspend production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", Clark says.
A Japanese carmaker says the impact of the delay will be seen in job losses if Brexit ends without a deal.
The factory  in Burnaston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models  produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other parts of the European Union.
'My view is that if the UK suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, we will have production interruptions', says Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota's Burnston unit.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how crossborder trade will work in the context of leaving the European Union.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini factory for a month once Brexit has taken place.
The main concern, according to the car manufacturers, is the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the JOT timing principle, with parts arriving at the plant every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and EU and the cars being made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts, according to the industry.
Toyota said that it was impossible to keep stock for more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant and that production would be halted.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal possible, which is not just about success in the current situation, but it's an opportunity we have to take advantage of", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers' statements show that we must absolutely be able to continue the supply chains that have worked very well so far.
Toyota cannot say how long the production would be suspended, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union manager at the factory, says there is growing concern among members: In my experience, lost jobs never come back.
A government spokesman says: 'We must present a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be pushed back another week due to the heated debate surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the ties of Trump aides to Russia, and possible actions by the president to obstruct justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months that Trump is planning to fire the assistant attorney general, which would jeopardize the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting is reported to have been Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was on a visit to the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date for the meeting was announced as Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it coincided with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's plenary vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, Sanders said, "No date set for this, it could be next week, this week, it could be postponed another week because of everything else that's going on in the Supreme Court right now".
I'll see, but I'm always trying to keep the press updated.
Some reporters might disagree with this statement: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10th.
Chris Wallace, the news anchor, asked me why.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press events is not because of dislike of TV reporters' "attention-seeking" attitude, but he said: "I don't deny the fact that they are attention-seeking".
But Sanders suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more interrogations than any president before him", he says, adding further evidence without quoting: "We have checked those numbers".
"There will still be press conferences", Sanders said, "but it's infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States than to talk to me".
We try to do this often, and you've seen us do it many times over the last few weeks, and this is going to replace the press release so that you can talk directly to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
It's rare to perform alone at a press conference.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why by making an uninhibited and occasionally bizarre appearance to reporters gathered there.
The Health Minister has written to NHS Scotland staff from EU countries about concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU healthcare workers in Scotland expressing his gratitude and hope that they will stay in the country after Brexit.
The letter was sent by Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for 'stabilized status' for EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: 'During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible divorce without a contract.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
So I want to reiterate how much we value the contribution of every employee to citizenship, regardless.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie has been admitted to the emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery after the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ reports.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just slipped in", Reed says.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him in pairs and taking him to the sideline for more detailed evaluation.
The Tennessee State newsman told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has recovered from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the type/size of the injury is unknown at this time" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a sophomore at Tennessee State University and is playing his first full season with the team since moving from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he was out of the game, which makes a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to new Conservative plans.
The amendment is designed to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The stamp duty increase applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today a higher stamp duty rate for foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money going towards helping the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters, who has made promises of cheaper housing and focused on taxing the well-off.
The stamp duty increase will be targeted at people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will be directed to government measures to alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The additional charge  added to the current stamp duty, in addition to the two-year-old increases in double and investment housing,  may be up to 3%.
The Minister for Finance expects the increase to be worth up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents, which increases prices and hinders first-time home buyers' chances in the homebuilding market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK  particularly in its capital  have become villages because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp duty as a way to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He blamed the big building companies for keeping property prices high by buying land and leaving it unbuilt, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to remedy the "disgraceful situation" of British housing.
Corbyn has published a series of striking proposals to reform the housing market, including limiting rents and ending 'confidential evictions'.
He also wants to give councils more power in matters relating to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says: 'I said last year that I was going to dedicate my term as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that every generation should live better than its predecessor.
This means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
It is not right, however, that non-UK residents and companies based abroad can buy housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, home ownership has become a distant dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to coach the Scotland national team".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become manager of the Scotland team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the challenge of taking home a team from the north-east of the country, currently third in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the Skylights Stadium this summer after guiding St Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
I used to watch the Scottish games with my dad in Hampden when I was a kid, and that's something that's always drawn me back.
I'm not going to be able to take this opportunity unless I'm successful as a manager.
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio, among others.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not worried about stepping into the boots of his namesake predecessors at the namesake club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
Right now, I'm measuring my own success by whether I can get this team back in the big leagues.
The structure and the ability of the club make it a league of choice, he says.
"It's not easy to get in, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could get the team back into the Premier League".
Ross has only been a manager for three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton and then for 15 months at the Heat's coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to promotion from the third tier of the Football League and lifted St Mirren from the relegation play-offs to the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads with my career", he recalls, "when he took over the management of Allo.
I really believed I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange, because I played well, earned moderately well, and enjoyed some relatively high success.
But gambling can be tough.
Every week, the player has to solve a lot of different things.
I'm still going through the same things, like the stress and the pressure of the job, but running a team feels like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to lead a team, and now I'm doing it for a living, and I feel better in my own body than I've ever felt in my adult life.
The full interview is available on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at 12:00 and 13:00 BST on the Radio Scotland frequency.
The perfect time to enjoy a drink is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., research shows.
The summer heat wave has given a boost to pubs struggling with Britain's problems, but at the same time it has added pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, pub and bar chains grew by 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: 'Continued sunny weather and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was a June-like month with pub sales up 2.8%, while the month for restaurants was even worse.
The 1.8 per cent drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinking were the most successful, with their like-for-like sales growing more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Food-oriented pubs also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It's like people just wanted to go out and drink.
Sales of drinks in business-run pubs and bars rose by 6.6% during the month, and food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman of RSM, a consultancy firm for leisure and hotel and restaurant services, says: The results continue a trend that has been ongoing since the end of April.
The weather and major social or sporting events are still the main factors affecting sales in the out-of-home dining market.
It is not surprising that the struggles of the restaurant chains continue, although the annual decline in sales of 4,8% is particularly acute at a time when the sector is currently struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have been worse for food-focused operators, and only time will tell whether the cooler temperatures in August will bring the industry a much-needed respite.
The total increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2,7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the establishment of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer that tracks the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector's sales, collecting and analysing performance data from 47 sectors of competence with combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is considered a reliable indicator of the sector.
One in five children hide their social media accounts from their parents
A study shows that one in five children - some as young as 11 - hide their social media accounts from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growing phenomenon of fake Instagram accounts
The news raised concerns that accounts could be used to share sexually explicit content
20% of pupils said they kept a "head account" which they showed to their parents
One fifth of children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapidly growing existence of "fake Instagram accounts", which refer to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has raised fears that accounts may post sexually explicit content.
20% of pupils said they kept their cleaned 'head' account for their parents to see while using other private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped after stumbling upon the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Consultative Council (HMC) found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two separate profiles, and half of those surveyed admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
I'm going to vote for Eilidh Doyle, the Scottish Athletes' Council.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive member to attend the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated all-round athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience gained by the athlete over the last decade.
'Eilidh is held in high esteem amongst sportsmen in Scotland, the UK and internationally.I am sure that Scottish sportsmen would benefit immensely from his appointment to the Cabinet', says Beattie.
Doyle says: 'I look forward to my role as the voice of the sport and hope to be of service and help steer Scottish sport in the right direction.'
The four-time Olympic gold medalist, who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and now serves as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his gait as a result of a transient cerebral hemorrhage.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke".
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say it's only a matter of time before I recover and get better.
This has been a tiring job, but I have made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and am now training for agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
An Ad That Likens Mothers to Cows Spreads Opinions on the Internet
An advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to dairy cows has spread opinions on the Internet.
Consumer electronics manufacturer Elvie has launched a product called 'the world's first silent, wearable breast pump' which is being promoted with a tongue-in-cheek, music video-style advertisement that describes the freedom the new pump brings to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled napkin, with the following lyrics: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not urine, it's tits".
The narrator goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, suck my breasts".
However, the advertisement on the company's Facebook page sparked a discussion on the Internet.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments, has generated mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it makes a mockery of the dairy industry's daily "squats".
Using cookies to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after birth, writes one commentator.

Another viewer commented: "Understandably, it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump to mothers who are allowed to hold their babies?
The third commenter added: 'A perfectly realistic advertisement.'
The ad also gained defenders: one woman admitted that she thought the ad was "a hoot".
I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant product, it says in the comments.
Another viewer commented: This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in toilets) and feel like cows.
The advertisement is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the commercial, the women reveal that they have danced with unnoticed pumps on their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits into the breast straps imperceptibly, allowing women freedom to move, hold the baby, and even go outside during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother, commented: The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By matching nursing mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges of using the breast pump into the spotlight, bringing out the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and identifying way.
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two performed on the catwalk wearing designer Marta Jakubowski's costume, using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in complete silence
The number of immigrant children detained has risen sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it more difficult to place children in foster care.
Most foster families have traditionally been made up of undocumented immigrants, and registering as a foster family can jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the household would have to provide their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified at a congressional hearing last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be foster parents for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Almost 80% of people who are either members of a surrogate family or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to keep looking for these people, Albence says.
In an effort to speed up the handling of children's cases, authorities have introduced new rules that require a court to hear a case within one month of an arrest, instead of the 60-day limit previously used, the reception center staff said.
Many prefer to appear via videoconference rather than in person in immigration court.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance are deported promptly.
Reports published in recent months by reception center workers and the system indicate that the time spent in custody of children affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Lawyers say the concern is particularly acute in larger institutions, such as the Torrillo, where signs of child despair may go unnoticed because of the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can be traumatic, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish fighter jets to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eight-year war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were in the country illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "they will be dealt with accordingly".
'They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,' he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and where millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue its "holy fight" until all of Syria was cleared of both terrorist organisations and "illegal foreign forces".
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, mainly to train and guide the Kurds and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed over 1,000 troops to the country to fight the war.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were good for returns and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
'We have called on the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns', he said.
They're politicizing what should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until the war is over, as agreed between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on an area of 3 million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has 'clear time limits' and expressed the hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front fighters, 'who will be eliminated'.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a committee of members of the new government and opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying its work should be limited to 'reviewing articles of the current constitution' and warning against interference.
Why Trump is getting re-elected
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the viral hype and scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak viewing times have more than doubled at CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled at 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average peak viewing time of 2.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached the cable television peak with 3.5 million viewers as the top newscast.
"This is a ruse that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", says Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's Designated Survivor, about the secretary who becomes president after the congressional building is destroyed in a bombing.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh", says Scovell.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the news from Washington can determine how Roe v. Wade plays out, whether immigrant families get to see each other, and how the global economy fares.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it is beyond the responsibilities of an informed citizen to watch six hours of an expert panel arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's sources for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot jacket, and Stormy Daniels' unadorned depictions of President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I can never watch Super Mario again the same way I used to.
"What he does feels like a reality TV show, because part of it is giving the audience something every night", says Brent Montgomery, president of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Homemade" series about the changing personalities and daily twists of the Trump show (NFL fights, Kim Jong-un's praise).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, at his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, it was a beautiful sunny day, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get out of the program where Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Judiciary Committee and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Money is flowing in from the outside for a tight midterm contest .
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District has faced a real cash flow, as congressional redistricting forces two of the candidates already elected to run for the same seat.
This newly redrawn Pittsburgh district is a battlefield for Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The redistricting was made after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old redistricting system unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the new 17th congressional district has triggered an economic struggle in the finance departments of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 percent.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a nice head start.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but backed down.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the mild response from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners ousted the Trump Organization executive.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of the outdated policy of no longer recognizing Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country, which has a high rate of unemployment and crime, hard.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity, which was seen as a step in efforts to prevent migrants from seeking entry into the United States.
However, in mid-September senior administration officials made clear that the meeting was to proceed, effectively ending speculation about El Salvador's possible punishment.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give a signal to the mid-October meeting on the weight the administration will give to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned in the above-mentioned report returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further annoying messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Lesson of History
The next inevitable step may be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which now has very strong evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether the Trump campaign was working in secret with Russia during the Russian interference in the US election.
If there is a change of power in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go before his constituents again, and possibly face the judgment of his peers.
There is a lot of speculation here, and I'm not saying that President Trump's defeat is inevitable, any more than the defeat of the same people in Europe.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those decisions will determine how long this struggle will take.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history is marked by such turning points as the inevitable march forward of democracy either accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are now facing many such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been under fire since it became public knowledge that he had suggested secretly recording the president's speech and was considering the president's possible inability to perform his duties.
Rosenstein says the Times report is flawed.
How do we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's activities is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these efforts, our democracy will be in for a long, dark winter.
But I believe we'll succeed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic post.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated with a crucifix.
How could I not be optimistic about the future with this legacy?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about Rapid Vienna.
Rangers face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that after a draw with Villarreal in Spain earlier in the same month, a win over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to enter the Europa League's G-Block.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from taking the field this season ahead of Villarreal's 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use that as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game expecting to get something and bring the score with us.
Maybe we could have taken the win at the end, but all things considered, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got the pace in the second and we were better.
Thursday is another big night in the Europa League.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did well in the last game, but I believe that with the support of this team we can give everything and we will get a positive result.
Last year was really tough in terms of my own injuries and changes in the team, but now I feel good.
The setup is good and the boys are enjoying themselves; the training is going well.
Hopefully we can now push the envelope, leave the season behind and succeed.
The fear of retirement savings robs women of sleep
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few had spoken about it to their loved ones.
About half of the respondents in the national survey said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of those surveyed said that they had spoken with their children about the matter.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't bring it up", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Corporation.
Start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you make your wishes known in time.
Discuss where and how to get help with the professional and your family, as these questions are an important cost factor.
Include financial advice in the discussion: it can also help you to find a way to cover these costs.
The options for financing long-term care may be traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-insurance if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes from occurring.
Get a health care representative on site so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the possibility of drawing up a power of attorney to handle your financial affairs.
It will help you to identify a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to care for them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents are on their way to the hospital for a health emergency.
Can you answer any questions about her medications and allergies?
Write such information down in a plan to prepare for the situation.
"It's not just about the financial side of things.
What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb.
The man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home late at night.
The victim, in his early 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.

The victim didn't see the assailant.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police have relied on eyewitness accounts.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palun on Friday, and officials say the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications to the area have been cut off, the rescue authorities have received no information from the area north of Pyongyang in Donggala Municipality, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palma since the disaster.
Key information on Palus and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami hit the city in the middle of its 40th anniversary celebration.
Donggala municipality extends over 300 kilometres (180 mi) along the northwestern coastline of Sulawesi Island.
Donggala Municipality is a county-level administrative region with an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of Central Sulawesi Province, and especially the coastal area of Donggala, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowali on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Pallu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past century.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and suffers from frequent earthquakes.
Some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra off the west coast of Aceh province, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 states and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of the victims in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the island's southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Aceh Pidie Jaya region, causing devastation and panic as people remember the massive destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin 's oldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence .
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, Track Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a police report Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and of resisting arrest and resisting a domestic violence report.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from his female companion when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Pretrial detention center and a $500 bail has been set, KTUU TV reported.
According to the report, Palin appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "not guilty".
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
That's when Palin's mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence, including possession of a weapon while under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior to traumatic stress disorder stemming from service in Iraq.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos circulating on social media from the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for beach festivals in the town of Palun when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that claimed eight lives, a rare sentence not carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The indictment alleges that Saipov, 30, used a rented Home Depot car in an October hit on the West Side Highway in Manhattan's South Side, where he drove over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the notice in the Southern District of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious physical injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges carry a possible death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of a terrorist organization, a term typically used by federal prosecutors in cases involving organized crime.
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "horrible, cruel and shameful".
'Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadti, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco', the indictment said.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
It has been a decade since the last time a court in the Southern District of New York handed down a death sentence.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution in New York was in a federal case in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said that Saipov also wanted an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of wire fraud.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events", Patton said.
Soapow's defense had previously asked that he not be sentenced to death.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East.
Nigel Farage has promised to mobilise the civil army at a protest against the Conservatives today.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that Britain would be out by now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But May faces deeply divided lines in negotiating a challenge underlined by the Remain Conservatives who joined a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal afloat amidst the pressure from Brexit supporters and opponents, and the EU.
The supporters demanded that he continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "push the Chequers proposal away".
He suggested that Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The Member for Wellingborough added: 'I am in favour of Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers proposal.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU by saying: 'We did not fight the world wars to end up as subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed the idea that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: 'The claim that the British changed their minds and wanted to stay is completely false.'
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and it will not be supported by the members of the party or the activists who are really taking to the streets and who are entirely responsible for our success.
I would ask you to abandon the Chequers proposal and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: 'Prime Ministers can keep their jobs as long as they keep their promises.'
Farage said politicians must feel the pressure if they are going to overturn the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
He said that the EU was not a party to the agreement.
They are trying to water down Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not accept it.
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want the politicians who are going to blow Brexit to feel the pressure from you.
'We will mobilise the army of the people of this country, which gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud nation.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved Tories Against Brexit signs, a group that was formed this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they had with the party's app at the start of the meeting.
'These are the people who say they are getting the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus scheme and unbundled border operations for free Irish trade', he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl in the November re-election, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren has been mentioned as a possible candidate against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th city hall meeting with voters since the start of the Trump administration.
One of the attendees asked if Warren was running for president.
Warren said, "Now is the time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrest in the LSU shooting of Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. today at the ET news conference.
Police had released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot near the campus of Southern University in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday via 247 Sports Network.
Wayde was defending his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted during interrogation that he was there, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken to East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims, a 6-foot-3, 198-pound junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after the team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team layouts are an important part of the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and left Hamilton almost with his own luck in defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel against his teammates.
Vettel went to the wagon first and left Hamilton to drive a set of tails, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes later rode the car around the track and returned to follow Vettel, but Hamilton passed after making some contact and after the Ferrari driver moved reluctantly from the inside, giving up his defended position after only two third-turn moves.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in the lead for much of the race, extending the tyre changeover to a quick finish and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally got to the wheel on lap 44, but was unable to increase speed with eight laps remaining as the Raven took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri was doing great all weekend and was a real gentleman passing me by.
"The team has done an exceptional job, winning the double", Hamilton said.
Very bad body language .
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a demonstration of the rudeness, cowardice and dishonesty of the people.
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate these last few days, is we're seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, vicious and dishonest", the president said.
When we see the publicity and the leaks and then they say, "Wow, I didn't do it".
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you dig up this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you sign the document... Oh, what?
Oh, my God.
I didn't bleed.
Just a second.
Did we... No, we didn't, he added the senator in a nutshell.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the allegations against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in his office.
"I did not hide Professor Ford's allegations, nor did I leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his wishes.
But his denial did not sit well with the president, who commented at a Saturday event: "Let me tell you, that was very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by three women of sexual harassment, and suspected Democrats were using the charges to their advantage.
They're determined to get back in power by any means necessary.
You see that viciousness and cruelty, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule, Mediaite reports the president saying.
The Elite League is Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee .
The Dundee Stars have claimed compensation for their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday, by winning 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had the lead in the opening round thanks to two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team back to the playoffs before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundwald's two goals secured the win.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced each other for the fourth time in the season after the Giants had won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaul, David Rutherford, who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt scored the Cowboys' equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first half by scoring his second goal of the night in the bottom of the first.
The home team rallied and Bouchard again tied the game with a power play in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen managed to score the first lead for Dundee at the end of the second half, and also secured his team's victory with a fifth goal in the mid-final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, next meet at home to Milton Keynes on Friday.
A flight attendant died while making sure that hundreds of passengers on board escaped the earthquake
In Indonesia, a pilot has become a hero after his death in making sure that an airplane carrying hundreds of passengers got off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are affecting the area and several people have been trapped in the collapsed material in the town of Palun.
Though his coworkers fled for their lives in a trade, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his post in the wildly creepy air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufrin Airport in Palus.
He remained stationary and made sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was airlifted safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said Agung's decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
A helicopter was being prepared from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pallu.
"This news breaks our hearts", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, as the country's disaster authorities have reported poor connections to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to be still rising, as many bodies are buried in the rubble and many people have not been reached", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said.
Waves as large as six feet [6.5 m] have devastated Pyongyang, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and cargo planes are bringing aid and equipment to the area.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambulance are bringing bodies in all the time.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, Indonesia director of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what to expect.
This is already a tragedy, but it could turn out to be even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and, speaking to the country's armed forces, said: 'I ask you all to work day and night to ensure that all evacuation tasks are completed.
Are you ready? CNN is reporting.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
In Micronesia, the airline representatives who crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific now report one person missing, although earlier reports had indicated that all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it had not been able to locate a single male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working to locate the man, working with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six people were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crashed over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"It's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that the passengers were able to wade through the water up to their waists in the sinking plane to the emergency exits.
He said the passenger crew panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working on a nearby dock helped to rescue people by carrying them ashore in a rubber dinghy before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in crashes involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in the crash.
Analyst's setting the time line for the night she was burned alive.
The prosecutor on Saturday concluded a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analysis.
He described to the jury how he had used the cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett said she had obtained location information from several cell phones that showed that, contrary to her earlier claims, Tells was with Chambers the night he died, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that Tells' cell phone was in Chambers's possession at the same time that Tells claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tells was telling the truth about being in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tells was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the cell phone records, they'd only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The closing arguments are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions associated with the genre by making music that is filled with positive messages.
According to Bristol-based group The High Breed, hip hop has moved away from its original message of political and social issues.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed the UK's new rise with acts like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A New York nanny sues a couple for a racist text message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory separation after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother complaining that she is "once again a black person".
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge to "intimidation".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay when new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived on her first day of work in 2016 and was told she was black.
Yesterday, after a long day, Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
Then she sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of her husband, twice.
According to the New York Post, the troubled Plasco-Flaxman, realizing his mistake, had fired Maurice, saying that the African-American nanny who had received their previous departure passes had done a poor job and was expecting a Filipino this time.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance and is seeking $350 a day for the six months he was originally assigned to live and work with the family, albeit without a contract.
'I want to show them that you can't do that,' he told the Post on Friday, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple have responded to racist allegations, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was a justified decision because they could not trust him after they had offended him.
My wife sent him something she didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists, Joel Plasco told the Post in an interview.
But would you leave your child in the care of someone you've been unkind to, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?
Plasco equated the challenge with blackmail and told me that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
You're gonna start chasing after someone else in a situation like this?
It is not very well done', the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, tearing apart their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared the public would identify with their talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was approved, says of the letter: "It is difficult to live in the position of someone who read the book for the first time before publication.
That's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known.
While acknowledging that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before devoting himself to writing children's books about the adventures of the teddy bear, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication felt bitter because his father had died the previous year.
He described Paddington as "a very important member of the family" and said that his father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a rather quiet man, not at all a bossy type", the daughter says.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him, something you're proud of, even though it's not really your own achievement.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter was rushed after the plane landed at the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called a little late and told me that the situation was really bad, that he wasn't expected to survive", Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called and said my daughter was gonna die in a couple of minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'm with you.
The drugs that doctors used to keep his heart going were gradually being eliminated from his system.
He was dead a little while ago, and now everything's gone.
I could just sit there, knowing it was all coming to an end.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, mourning the loss of his daughter, Ednan-Laperouse boarded a plane with other passengers who knew nothing of the ordeal he was undergoing.
"No one knew", he said.
I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a tremendous amount of compassion for Nadia.
That she needed my love and understanding right now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.
Dying women send cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number to get support.
Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression at age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
"I would not want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day", he said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, says his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile lit up the room.
However, he stopped his work before he died because he felt he was in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother, who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the aftereffects.
Davis made the cards to tell people that there are people you can go to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent, you have to talk.
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies' for many years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was depressed or anything like that", Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was all over the floor on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything like that.
She says Mark's death was a big trauma for them, but they still have to move on: "It's breaking up the family".
It's gonna tear us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight on.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
'I thought that if we could really do what he wanted - a time-limited and limited inquiry - maybe we could get some unity,' Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would 'disintegrate' into the deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
The problem with reluctance is timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republican victory is as weak as expected, their quest to get the man they want elected to the nation's highest court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the senators to lobby them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's time and met through him his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes the report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is holding a vote.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to blow the whistle and confirm his choice for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean outlaws is dropping under Kim.
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of people who have defected to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Unification Ministry as saying that there were 1,127 transplants last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the price increases for smugglers.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on the matter.
Most North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats trespassers as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and most often forcibly returns them.
Still, technically, relations between the warring North and South Koreas have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, world leaders met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This followed the historic June meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed at the general level to pursue denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for being stuck in the sanctions post-meeting.
"Without any confidence from the US, our national security is not on a sound footing and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm first", Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and "unfit to serve on the Supreme Court".
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if she had behaved like that, she would have been called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of his own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has very strongly denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was overcome with emotion and sometimes nearly cried and lost his speech as he told of his family and high school years.
He also strongly condemned the allegations against the Democratic members of the committee, without calling them a "grotesque and systematic persecution of a person" by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased toward Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", Pelosi said.
The fear was raised when he was asked if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if his election was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"Let's put it this way - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court where he's currently working", Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently serving on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Your fear added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible orders on health care reform or Roe v. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative jurist.
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected to the court and we should be expected to say that it is great", Pelosi said.
Women have to get through everything.
It is a legitimate fiery speech, with months and years of rage, and he cannot keep it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual at all, do you?
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a position of authority somewhere and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her interlocutor in a situation where she got angry and started to cry: 'You may think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really mad.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are justified as a way to vent anger, even though they are generally fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most memorable moments of my early work in the male-dominated office is when I was crying in a rage and an older woman - a cold-hearted supervisor whom I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and then they're happy because they hurt your mind.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and was thrown out of the race, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason why he should not run for president himself.
"It was not a very well-thought-out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates and the least needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign running late, he was behind on the fundraiser, so he announced that he would not run unless he had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He realized that some of his supporters, who gave male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not run for office, she was overwhelmed by emotion -- gratitude to her supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds for voters and not delegates for election work, and hatred of sexism -- that she couldn't speak.
"You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalls the press reaction.
You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, "My headstone will probably be smashed into a memorial inscription".
She was crying.
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening shot in the U.S.-China trade war was a deafening one, and while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's main exports, which include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of imported goods, effectively taxing half of all products imported from China into the United States.
Beijing has responded in equal measure each time, last imposing tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion worth of American imports.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye for an eye, and it does not appear that the world's second-largest economy is in any way slowing down.
To get Washington to back down, it would have to give in to its own demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the U.S. trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by reducing interdependence.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that trigger an economic downturn in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than the bystanders have realized so far", says Abigail Grace, an Asia research assistant at the Center for New American Security.
Syrian Foreign Minister says country is "ready" for refugees to return
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
'The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism', he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The conditions now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would be grateful for assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from states that supported the rebels.
The European team confirmed victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight in Europe, and it hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown for itself when its Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, and his team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star player Phil Mickelson struggled for most of the tournament and hit his opening shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
Italian Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to record a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a score of 5&4 against the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may now be playing his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the tournament's all-time leading European with a career total of 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help it tonight.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get this win.
It's a team and I'm happy I could help", said Garcia, moved by the European team's victory.
He will pass the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 & 1 in the individual competition played on Sunday.
"I feel tremendous pride in winning Tiger Woods, who I grew up admiring", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Odd statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had difficulty finding trails all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
After the performance, the captain of the U.S. team, Jim Fury, said of his team's failure: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We pressed the European team in the games this morning.
We got it.
- What a treat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're re-grouping, I'm working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're moving forward.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'll have to take my hat off to you.
We met our winner.
Red tide flowering situation: decreasing concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to a recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decline in the population of mosses in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more dispersed areas are reported from the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a possible reduction in concentrations.
The Red Tide flower bed stretches along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee County.
The reefs can be seen ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they're less than they were last week.
Red tide is also being spotted in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the coast of Pinellas County last week, ranging from low to high concentrations in the coastal Hillsborough County, from background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee and Sarasota counties, from background concentrations to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and from background concentrations to high concentrations in the coastal Lee County and Collier County.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier areas.
For the past week, no reports of respiratory symptoms have been reported from northwest Florida.
