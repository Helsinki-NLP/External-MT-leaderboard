Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) disease in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in EU countries/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom which confirms that, although the stages vary by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the disease is a new coronavirus now called the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild illnesses, respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious disease and requires hospital treatment, while another 6% of cases develop a critical disease that requires intensive care.
Mortality rates of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 are around 4%.
In this study, we looked at the cumulative COVID-19 incidence trends of the EU/EEA countries and the UK and compared them with incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of current COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has experienced further geographic spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with a confirmed case of COVID-19 based on WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with those dates included, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported by each country around the world is updated daily at 8.00 a.m. This figure is obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as compare them to trends in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of the delayed 14 days, so we took into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported by each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to the cases in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, cumulative incidents of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February, then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This trend is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar trend in increasing cumulative incidents of COVID-19 (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, as of 8am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases that was comparable to the total number of cases in Italy three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative incidents of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable rate across all countries.
This is despite the differences in the stages experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on COVID-19 admission to hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level is only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data is not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and medical care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and nursing beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modelling scenario related to the saturation of healthcare capacity, with estimated prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases for each EU/EEA country and UK related to risk >90% exceeding the intensive care bed capacity, is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
As cases are so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve populations covered by certain regional services, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of the Regional Unit Naming for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very quickly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and the increased number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, particularly intensive care, as is the case in affected areas in Italy.
As demonstrated in recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt to appropriate responses if it is not implemented beforehand.
The rapid risk assessment also includes public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
A short window of opportunity is available when countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on healthcare.
If it fails, other EU/EEA healthcare systems are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters to humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more contagious and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly growing research subject.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review will help us understand and combat this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were ordered to stay home during the holidays and weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus disease.
It is very homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being returned and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the public enemy number 1 and has the potential to be more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established virus sequences isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, covering virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research in this rapidly developing new field.
As far as possible, we'll try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other COVID-caused diseases, which are Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis and some other unanswered but urgent questions.
Traditionally, CoV has been considered a nonlethal pathogen for humans, primarily causing about 15% of the common cold.
Yet, in this century, we've seen two highly pathogenic human-causing viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing an outbreak that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with horrific morbidities and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third recorded outbreak of COVID-19 in human history.
As shown in Feb. 1.1, clusters of pneumonia with unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequences were launched.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, health care provider infections were reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On January 23, a regional quarantine was imposed in Wuhan city and all public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered to be the initial location of infection from unknown animal sources.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this writing, the disease had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide. - Heb. 2:2.
As the situation develops so rapidly, the end coverage and severity of the outbreak still have to be determined.
As of February 11, 2020, a multi-center study in 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presents the following updated epidemiological overview (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially at ages 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected are over 50, only a few are under 20, and only 14 infected are under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from gestation to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, in line with the massive transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the corresponding mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large viral subfamily of sampled RNA-sensing single strands.
CoVs can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
The coating of the spike (S) or spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA accompanied by the envelope glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% among 10 samples that were sequential; the samples were taken from the outbreak's origin location, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very thin part of the human respiratory tract's epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than its binding to SARS-CoV S protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections not as severe as SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded with orf3b and proteins secreted with orf8 code.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b protein may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformations, is composed of dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which is evidence for identification and infection with CoV.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in drug filtration to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother of origin and midwife
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are each transmitted to humans through mosquitoes and camels.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate hosts that help the virus cross species barriers to infect humans are still unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed that snakes be a virus carrier from bats to humans involving recombination of homologs within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that the long-nosed ant-eating, ant-eating mammal that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine, has the potential to be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology to the CoV found in the ant and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread throughout the genome is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Heb. 3).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ethers, 75% ethanol, disinfectants containing chlorine, acetate acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disable the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Feb. 4).
In general, after invading a host, a virus is recognized by the innate immune system through a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), which includes a C-type lectin-like receptor, a Toll-like receptor (TLR), a NOD-like receptor (NLR), and a RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagocytosis of the virus antigen by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune responses joined in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
Helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have recovered neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce large amounts of locally released radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, failure of the compound organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a cluster of acne, affects more elderly people with the disease and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is vital that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected, but symptom-free, people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/ or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's disease progresses rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who experience fever and/or symptoms of respiratory and acute fever, even if without lung imaging disorders, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, a family cluster study and a cluster study caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throats (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were shown to be major symptoms and ventilation support was needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached a high of 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 ranged only from 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
The figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not match MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Cluster winds are often found in a single family or from a group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contacting infected people or patients in the last two weeks prior to the outbreak.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again.
In the early stages, patients have a normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte counts < 1×109/L, and increased levels of aminotransferase aspartate as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels increased in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood clotting rates increased in most patients.
In severe cases, levels of D-dimer, the breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, increase and lymphocyte counts decrease progressively.
Thoracic photo-dysfunction is found in a large proportion of COVID-19 patients and is characterized by bilateral convex shadows or ground-glass opasities in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravate gas exchange disruptions.
Pneumocyte dysfunction of type I and type II decreases surfactant levels and increases surface pressure thereby lowering the lung's ability to develop and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings on thoracic photos often parallel the most severe disease rates.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte squamous discharge, formation of hialin membrane, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multiple nucleated synaptic cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS as well as similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high levels of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group explained the protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a cap rod in less than an hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified on clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors primarily offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been previously used or proposed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential therapies with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from healed patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and a leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a thermodified cardiopulmonary short-term technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening respiration.
In addition, electrolyte balance maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the management of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppression 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affect prognosis.
However, short-term low- to moderate-dose corticosteroid administration is recommended to be given with caution to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, there has been no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be beneficial in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single stranded RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound to China to conduct a series of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions with other medicines used by patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from the healed patient and antibody production
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who have the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
Indeed, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight off pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize molecules unique to pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation and viral load as well as an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to propose such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related drawbacks must be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and large amounts of plasma are needed to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify the genetic code that codes for effective antibodies or perform effective antibody filtration against proteins that are important to the virus.
This way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combination.
Currently, as effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not yet exist, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top cure rates in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in some Chinese provinces using TCM in 87% of their patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as patient numbers and severity, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine therapy (WM) alone with combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time it took to recover from body temperature, to lose symptoms, and to be hospitalized was much shorter in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptomatic erosion (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM+TCM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM+TCM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still awaiting better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanisms of work and clarify the effective components of TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients feel very scared of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people also feel bored, lonely, and angry.
Furthermore, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as therapeutic side effects such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can cause increased anxiety and mental stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor upheaval, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal thoughts have been reported.
Tracking contact history and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspects, and people who come into contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and a therapy plan as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts and often complement antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by virus emergence.
Efforts have been made to develop an S protein-based vaccine, which in the long term and effectively creates antibodies to neutralize and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, the life-debilitating vaccine has been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the elderly and its lethal challenge model as well as its protection against zoonotic viral infections have yet to be determined before clinical trials begin.
This is probably because SARS eased 17 years ago and there have been no new cases reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic and cluster cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and have been partially evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easily overcome due to the long time to develop a vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical journey in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of disease prognosis models is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs in the age group of 30-65 years with 47.7% of patients over 50 years in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who require intensive care tend to have absorbent and complicated comorbidities and are significantly older than patients who do not require intensive care (median age 66 years versus 51 years), which suggests age as a prognostic factor for the end result of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart attacks are also a leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive colangiosites, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are closely related and can interact.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
Correlations between CRP levels and severity and COVID-19 prognosis have also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) may also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, these enzymes are the traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Thoracic photos and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered alongside other factors to predict the end results and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressive drugs that are widely used as supportive therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered extreme stress because they had to go through long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Long-term psychological counseling and support should be provided to help the patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomless symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause a cold.
Therefore, in the early stages or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which creates great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, a major effort is underway in China, which includes quarantine of Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of breaking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have been devastating to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new cases has declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates state that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-concussion and throat tissue of patients who had recovered and returned from hospital 2 weeks earlier.
Nevertheless, promising signs are showing up in China, seen from the decline in the number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases and half as many deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease is finally under control.
It is also possible that, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or becomes a less pathogenic virus that can coexist with humans.
Comparisons of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics are given below (Feb. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be transmitted through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in the faeces, which gives rise to a new possibility of transmission, fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Careful precautions should therefore be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even people who have accidental contact with a patient or an infected person.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series numbers 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep splashes of potentially infected people from trapping air or sticking to the surface of the material, where the splashes can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series numbers 1860s) can protect against virion inhalation of as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion being fully penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both measuring about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, health care providers who contact the patient directly must wear N95 (series number 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate insulation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet is believed to be adequate to keep the patient at a distance.
These actions are an effective method to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should serve as a major warning to China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured residents by saying that the new virus has a low spread nature and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and that prevention and control of the disease is not a problem.
This message soothes the fears of the people, especially as the entire country prepares for the Spring Festival, that this critical time is late to curb the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, these bodies should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by residents and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorities; (3) be more restrictive in order to curb potential epidemics in the early stages, and not try to calm the public; and (4) more often produce targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of disease epidemics and to periodically test and improve public response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and to more than 50 countries worldwide at the time of this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak gives the impression that SARS outbreaks are recurring.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial for curbing the epidemic and managing patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill. This makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part the reason why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered may return positive results from the virus test.
This finding greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-like CoVs, we still have not been able to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What species of animals are intermediate in transmitting viruses from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers number one and two, we cannot effectively disconnect the transmission and the outbreak can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical origins suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly did the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and result in further pathological changes?
Does this virus bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How do viruses evolve genetically during human transmission?
Will this pandemic become a global pandemic, end like SARS, or recur periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are important, but they may take time to find.
Yet, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible so that we can return to normal life.
The zoonotic origin of the human corona virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses, such as measles.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) turned things upside down and revealed how highly damaging and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has made the CoV back in the spotlight and surprised us with high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its sister, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis, so understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs will be beneficial for us.
Most HCoVs are derived from bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs of several HCoVs have also been identified.
Identifying the host has direct implications in preventing human disease.
Research into the interactions of CoV-infection in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast these HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and genomic recombination.
The 2019 COVID-19 epidemic is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host transition and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity were also highlighted.
The corona virus (CoV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of veiled, positively-induced, single-stranded RNA viruses.
It has the largest genome at 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoVs", because of its crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Based on their structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that have similar layouts.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other. Both are translated into replicating polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes a thong or spike (S), a sheath or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complement proteins specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoVs and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while poultry are the primary reservoir for gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continually crossed species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human co-viruses (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as fever and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and having a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestation outside the lung organs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the intestines of infected patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, it has been widely accepted that HCoV infections are generally harmless, until SARS outbreaks occur.
The SARS outbreak of 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in modern history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a rough mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV), further referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins in bats, rats, or pets.
There is considerable evidence to support the evolution of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoVs adapt well and are nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motive power, and restrictive factors of interspecies transfer.
The study may also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir host animals, intermediates, and amplification of SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications in preventing future spread.
In this review, we provide an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoV.
We specifically highlighted and discussed a common topic that the HCoVs' parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trends of HCoVs that increased transmission capabilities are often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The final outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoV has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first strain of HCoV-229E B814 from the intestines of patients infected with measles, various CoVs had been isolated from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airway of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibited seizure symptoms, which included headaches, sneezing, lethargy, and sore throats, accompanied by fever and cough that were seen in 10~20% of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequential sequence pathways in the still-feeding cerebrum.
The clinical description of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to infections caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and tend to be most transmitted during winter in temperate climates.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by a sickness period of about two weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild seizures.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems show a low-weight respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-documented HCoV-induced pandemic in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super contagious, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with incubation periods of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load seen on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, lethargy, and dizziness, followed by dyspnea, cough, and shortness of breath as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophageal growth have also been observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also become infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal, especially in patients with weak immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of zero-patient relatives who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a huge effort has been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from 7-month-old children from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus is initially very common in young children, the elderly, and vulnerable patients who suffer from respiratory illnesses.
Choriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explained the same virus isolation from nasal specimens of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, the virus has spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of general respiratory disease and peaks in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
These four community HCoVs have been fully adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, such as in the case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63 which was recently reported to cause a severe respiratory tract infection in China.
Generally, when the ability to move efficiently and maintain self-preservation in humans is gained, the virulence and pathogenicity of this HCoV also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute renal failure, which so far is the only one of the HCoV-induced diseases to occur in MERS.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with high case fatalities, at 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most terrifying viruses known to man.
In mid- to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients that were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross case fatality rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while the death rate outside Hubei was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a picture of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea has also been found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their high nucleotide sequence homology, at 82%, they are both grouped into different phylogenetic tree branches.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may have played a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the HCoV disease journey are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 followed the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more general picture seen in Community HCoV infections, which includes a picture of mild or even symptomless nonspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small fraction of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infection even at a slightly lower ratio.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities to community HCoV as well as SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community HCoVs.
On the other hand, the decreased transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 after several human pathways still needs to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from fecal samples.
"Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, is yet to be clarified by further studies".
It is also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoVs.
However, the picture of SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission capabilities, pathogenicity, and continued transmission in multiple pathways in humans, will have a major impact on the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may have been the surviving species of the prehistoric HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that experience severe HCoV disease have been wiped out.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient numbers to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations in order to fight off host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community-based CoVs have spread to the human population and triggered seizures in immunocompetent people.
The virus doesn't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not yet adapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
Both must defend themselves and breed in zoonotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar descriptions to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like community HCoVs, at least for now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoVs and is not pathogenic to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir host or intermediate animal.
Before we discuss the origin of HCoVs, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplification of HCoVs.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoVs if they have close relatives and share a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Ancestral viruses usually adapt well and are nonpathogenic in these hosts.
Similarly, the reservoir hosts carry HCoVs continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or the parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoVs have entered the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not yet adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
These intermediate mothers can serve as zoonotic sources of human infection and act as amplifying hosts by allowing viruses to temporarily replicate, then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can become pathogenic if they cannot maintain transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the host of the natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data reveal in retrospect that zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with game animals.
Further seroprevalence studies indicated that these animal sellers had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
The moon mosquito (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in the live animal market were the first to be identified as carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS have been reported since all the mosquitoes in the market were killed.
Nevertheless, it is reported that moons from wildlife or farms not exposed to the live animal market largely give negative test results for SARS-CoV. This suggests that the moons may only act as an intermediate amplifying host, but not a natural SARS-CoV resorvoir.
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that it is possible that many small mammal species also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these hosts appear to be end-users of SARS-CoV.
A further search of natural animal hosts for SARS-CoV revealed a close-related bat CoV, called the Rhinolopus bat CoV related to SARS-HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese equine bats.
The bat tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts to newly emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat feces samples was shown to use ACE2 in bats, foxes, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of a convalescent SARS patient can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not hosts of the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat Co-V-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, peptidase 4 (DPP4), as a virus entryway.
The MERS-CoV dependent polymerase RNA sequence is phylogenetically closer to its similarity in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Therefore, bats may not be the direct host of the MERS-CoV reservoir.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that Arab camels give a seropositive result to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, similar to camels from the Middle East in some African countries.
MERS-CoVs are living viruses identical to those found in humans isolated from the nasal passages of Arabian camels.
It is also important to note that a massive decay of the virus with usually mild symptoms was observed in test camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that infected camels enter the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus decay from bats.
However, the question remains unanswered as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, the possibility of human-to-human transmission or unknown route of transmission involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish a maternal relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2, unless a nearly identical bat CoV is found later.
It is likely that the host of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal is among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood wholesale market.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences suggest that a group of small, endangered mammals, known as the prawns (Manis javanica), may also carry an ancestral beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of this new strain of CoV shares 85-92% homology of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is as close a relative as RaTG13 with 90% similarity in nucleotide sequence rate.
They are grouped into two sub-lineages of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic trees, one sharing a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Remarkably, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much different, although the overall sequence homology rate of the genome is higher.
Previous studies on sick prawns also reported detection of viral contig from a lung sample, which was also related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different methodologies of preparation and manual curating to produce partial genome sequences comprising about 86.3% of the complete virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the prawn is one of the hosts of SARS-CoV-2 mid-life.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from the strain due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the strain-related beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, prawns, and other mammals remains to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 strain-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the sequence level of the entire genome.
It is highly speculative to say that the high level of similarity between the RBD beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 strain and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The comparative hypothesis supports recombination between the beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 strain-like and RaTG13 relatives in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving factor, recombination occurs widely among beta-CoVs.
Researchers have not yet been able to determine the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoV, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in three-colored North American bats shows close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other bat CoVs, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which were detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also suspected to be an intermediate host.
For clarity, current knowledge of the known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from livestock to infect humans, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there's an alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may be in contact with bats in the shared ecological loop.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca-alpha-CoVs cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas get the alpha-CoV-related HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra viruses.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility is that while bat alpha-CoVs serve as a shell of the HCoV-229E gene, alpacas and Arab camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arabian camels and from Arabian camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known from early identification of the virus and is also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rich host of viral species for interspecies genetic fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Long life span, tightly-fused colonies, close social interaction, and strong flying ability all support bats to become the ideal 'virus transmitter'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arab camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable, natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is accidental and humans remain the final hosts of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of termites, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the strawberry beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in strawberries.
The caterpillar may be the final host for the SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV relative, similar to the mosquito in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be considered or excluded.
First, bats could be a reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2's related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological slopes with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the stingray could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts for the recently introduced SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans get the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is likely that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody tests on pets and wildlife are required.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in third species that come into contact with both bats and prawns.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three major factors from the virus side are also important to make it easier for the CoV to cross the species barrier.
First, the relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of CoV can be considered sed to high with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per foot, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to the new host.
CoV has a corrective, elimination exoribonuclease that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's nucleotide analogue is known to suppress the replication of CoV by inhibiting this exoribunuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutation of the CoV is about a million times higher than that of its host.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV has not yet adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoVs with high mutation rates, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation in humans.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts that are closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has adapted to Arab camels.
In theory, there is little chance that genetic drift will quickly render vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genomes in CoVs provide extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded toward the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique selective-copy mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing vessels, strand transitions frequently occur during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs can recombine to form new CoVs.
Evidence of natural recombination phylogenetic has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Viral-infected interactions in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interactions with host receptors are another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and mosquito SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is suspected to have rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
Generally, the RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is intensively targeted for host antibody responses.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its correceptors as a virus entryway.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, wasps, rats, and raccoon dogs, thus enabling the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only six amino acid residues have been observed to differ between human and mosquito virus isolates in RBD and four of them are located in receptor binding patterns for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV fox has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the proton clot protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be essential for the human adaptation of the virus.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein implies that the affinity of binding of S protein to human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed an affinity of binding human ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also important to know if there are other receptors that may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-thresethylation for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of adapting this CoV in humans after interspecies transmission from its host host.
In addition to the cell receptors, the end result of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also regulated by other host dependence and restriction factors.
These host protein differences between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be barriers to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over the host dependence factor and break down the host restriction factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in these important viral-mother interactions still have to be identified and characterized.
Impartial genomic filtration to see dependence factors and host restriction of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCoV emerges: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bat CoVs provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoV acts as a shell of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also spurred the evolution of HCoVs and served as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein-binding gene has the potential to drastically modify the virus phenotype.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because isolated SARS-CoV bat viruses were found to encode a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a characteristic elimination characteristic of 29 nucleotides was found in isolated strains at the beginning of human epidemics.
This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase-dependent RNAs.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, recombination events between different lineages have been shown to occur in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may play a role in unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely due to the release of the virus from the selection pressure it undergoes, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While whole ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows single nucleotide insertion resulting in skeletal shifts.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV was also driven by selection pressures in its reservoir hosts.
Mild or symptomless symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoV and bats.
It seems bats adapt well to the CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a failure to activate the proinflammatory response in bats would effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receptors and low levels of expression of major class I histocompatibility complex molecules.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from high bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and affect correction by exoribonuclease thus putting selective pressure on the production of highly pathogenic virus strains upon entry into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV may also develop through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of a protein or new protein features for host adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir host, such as bats and camels.
The CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret lies to the presence of the symptomless carrier and the cause of severe cases of human infection.
Symptoms are severe mainly due to excessive immune response activation and cytokine storm, with lung damage becoming more severe if the immune response becomes stronger.
In contrast, in the symptomless carriers, the immune response was already independent of the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for determining the linkage of immune responses may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory factor in bats is defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 may be beneficial in the management of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoVs that share 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, bat CoVs that share 96% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2 have been found.
Although mosquitoes and other animals on the market were found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
A highly homologous strawberry beta-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 has been found, suggesting that the strawberry may have served as one of the intermediate hosts or the strawberry beta-CoV may have contributed gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still in question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either intentionally or accidentally.
CoV has been re-focused on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoVs in human transmission.
There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and mosquitoes in wet markets, it is possible that the closure of wet markets and the killing of all mosquitoes in them effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the dagger should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several strains of the beta-CoV of the dagger that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to humans through termites and other mammals remain to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in Arab camels for a long time.
The camel served as an important means of transportation and as a primary source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
Arab camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to kill all camels to control MERS, as we did in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can eliminate the virus, a new genotype could emerge and cause an outbreak.
A variety of zoonotic cov are circulating in the wild.
In particular, the zoonotically potentiated CoV of bats is highly diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of wild animal feeding in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and control plans must be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have been around the planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance of spreading.
Although bats have many traits that support the spread of the virus, the chances of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if humans are guided to avoid wild animals.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to keep a distance from the natural ecological catchment of zoonotic virus reservoirs.
Some parts of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to the prawn, the condition when bats and prawns share ecological slopes is important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans communicate with bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that is actually the intermediate host, the way that the mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and prawns, should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance should be conducted.
Whether bats, prawns, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus can be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will outline the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and management of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
Nevertheless, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also continually being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for both predicted and confirmed cases based on the Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, which is now formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide has been published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted much attention since its publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the commission has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts substantially changed.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., who introduced a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference for the pandemic worldwide.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case a combination of one epidemiological history overview with two clinical manifestations is required to make a comprehensive analysis, or the fulfillment of three clinical manifestations is required if no clear epidemiological history is present:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients experiencing fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as homes, offices, school classrooms, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts indicate normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte counts in the early stages of development.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on a predicted case with either the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire virus genome showing high homogeneity for the new known coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or change of IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or titer increased ≥4 times in the recovery phase above the rate in the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acid in a sample of the respiratory tract or blood was added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection on blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on ongoing research by researchers to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the airway including blood drawings, which increase the availability of various specimens, and support the inclusion of certain positive antibody results into confirmed criteria.
Moreover, there is growing evidence that warns us to be vigilant in patients with both atypical and symptomless symptoms.
Therefore, the flow charts of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system will also need to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of both suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend following and adhering to the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidelines periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported the number of recorded infection cases including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases living at home.
There were 17 deaths.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two cases were between 51 and 60, and one case was between 41 and 50.
He also said two victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader said public transport would be suspended longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transportation shutdown has been in effect since March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic necessities -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infections have exceeded one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection with SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia suffered its first coronavirus death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few remaining free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there are more than 244,000 reported cases of the coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there have been more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the quarantine of the region until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians will remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extends the night time in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to the full day; previously, it was only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement night time between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia lowered the purchase limit of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian retailers Woolworth and Coles lowered the purchase limit of toilet paper to two and one pack per transaction in all stores nationwide.
ALDI also implemented the one-pack limit, on Monday.
The restrictions were announced as messages in the cash register and on his Facebook page.
Buyers reportedly stockpiling supplies out of fear of COVID-19 if the public had to go into self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
The change follows the four-pack restrictions per transaction previously applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
In a media statement on March 8, Coles reported that with the lifting of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out within an hour of delivery", calling the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales "surged sharply" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the number of packages allowed to two last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local government agency restrictions on truck delivery time made it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, as long as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because it had released supplies earlier, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills up the supply every night.
He stressed that toilet paper was a large-volume item so that the quantity of supplies was low and, if sold out, left so much empty space on the shelves that the scarcity of items became increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue that if there were a lot of stuff on the shelves, if products like toilet paper and sanitation could be bought and there were a lot of them, panic could be minimized, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex Toilet Fabric, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed that they work 24/7 to keep supplies, according to News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some property sellers offered free toiletries to the first auctioneer in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held as buyers took a break for the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores actually refused to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, saying they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, sanitation, dry foods, handwashing soap, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British online supermarket Ocado was observed restricting the purchase of Andres' toilet towels to two packs containing 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the cases are, WHO notes the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
If a country detects, tests, deals with, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We were very alert both to the alarming rate of spread and severity and to the alarming rate of slow action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has never happened before".
He said, in a report published by CNN in February, "except for influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever been traced from its emergence to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus".
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows a WHO decision in January that declared the outbreak a public health disorder that is affecting the world.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "at the core, the outbreak will get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a World-Dangering Public Health Disorder on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have been cured.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, closing the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for suspected infected people.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, nighttime hours, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, delay or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, sporting activities, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed both nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is thought to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is related to bat coronavirus, shingles coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to have become ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no clear connection to the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial clusters of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be associated with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a traceable case to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was likely the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases inside China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with people aged 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.The chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the UK population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that this undocumented infection was the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number is likely to be 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 patients recovered.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing health conditions, which included cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual fatality rate from COVID-19 may be much higher, given that official figures may not include people who die without being tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculations by a factor of 4-5 times.
A female spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual numbers", a statement reinforced by non-scientific reports of overly low deaths in the U.S. Overly low deaths often appear in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy respectively.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and over time, as well as being influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio was 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) as of April 10, 2020.
These numbers vary by region.
In China, the estimated death rate to cases decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptomatic persistence from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptomatic persistence after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed to die from a particular disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the overall infection fatality rate for the pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzed the impact of corn on CFR estimates.
WHO has confirmed that the pandemic is controllable.
The peak and end of the epidemic are unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states: "Without any control, infectious outbreaks usually slow down and then begin to decline when the host is out of stock.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at this time of when that will happen".
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the outbreak may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, likely for up to a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraints and other measures would be necessary "until vaccines are available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's unlikely that the coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, could disappear altogether" and that the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
The repeat virulence will depend on the group's immunity and the rate of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be symptomless.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of breathing sputum (flegma), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, tingling, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including shortness of breath, chest tightness or pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bruising of the face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who have close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to ensure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (time between infection and symptom onset) typically ranges from 1 to 14 days, usually 5 days. For example, uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 patients who lose their sense of smell initially was 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details of how the disease spread are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur primarily during close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that uncovered coughs can cause a droplet to push 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that viruses may also be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Breathing droplets may also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although the virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
The droplet may fall into the mouth or nose of someone nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (PRR), can turn the respiratory secretion into aerosols and then spread through the air.
It can also occur when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus may spread through the faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious within the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms are apparent and in the later stages of the disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Few reports of asymptomatic cases have been confirmed laboratory-wise, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that viruses can be detected for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have already been touched by an infected person.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia-associated clusters of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are associated with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by exposure to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.
The virus is thought to have zoonotic origins.
Genetic analysis reveals that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two bat-derived strains.
The virus has a 96% similarity across the genome to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the shingles virus and the human virus.
To date, a comparison of the entire genome has found that there is at most 92% similarity of genetic material between the coronavirus ganglion and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that ganglion is the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by a virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately made through reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected secretions or bypass CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CTs should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be performed on breathing or blood samples.
Results are generally available in a matter of hours to days.
Generally, this test is done on nasopharynx, but throat exfoliation can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests have been proven accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
In the U.S., serological testing developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Features of computed tomography (CT) radiography and computed tomography (CT) imaging in people who are symptomatic include asymmetrical opacity of the peripheral ground glass and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because of overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect virus imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining a thorough personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing a towel when coughing or sneezing and throwing the towel directly into the garbage can.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical restraining measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or urged to stop all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a social scale stage in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread to the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Healthcare providers who treat people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with statements coming out from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance proximity to other phones.
Furthermore, users will receive messages if they are close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are spreading; for example, rinsing the nose and flushing with an ineffective flushing medication.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they leave the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after they have pierced their noses, coughed up, or sneezed.
This is because, outside the human body, viruses are killed by household soap that destroys their protective layers.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60% by volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute of disinfectant exposure to stainless steel surfaces), including ethanol 6271%, isopropanol 50100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.27.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are any suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or childcare facilities, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by patients, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with bent elbows or using tissue when coughing or sneezing, then immediately dispose of the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the expiracy droplet that spreads when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch the face with inadequately clean hands, which is a major source of infection".
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those treating COVID-19 patients, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their face.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends the use of single-use medical masks to healthy communities, especially when in close proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks when using public transport or living in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit their citizens from going out into public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the tower to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all its citizens to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has mandated that passengers on interurban trains and buses wear face masks by April 1.
Panama mandates the use of face masks whenever outdoors, and recommends making homemade face masks for those who cannot afford to buy facial masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restraint (also called physical restraint) is an infection control action intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods of social restriction include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restraint methods by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Today, many governments impose or relieve social restrictions in areas affected by epidemics.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, from 250 people (if no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings involving more than two people. Elderly people and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and disrupted immune systems who have a higher risk of serious illness and complications advised the CDC to be as much as possible at home only in areas with outbreaks at the community level.
The use of the term "social restraint" implies that people should be completely socially isolated and not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
This recommendation includes encouraging sex only with people who live with you and do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments mandate or recommend self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for people who belong to high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread COVID-19 spread are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategy in epidemic control is containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as take other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to curb the spread of disease, further efforts move to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and the public.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be performed simultaneously.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive numbers to less than 1.Part of managing the outbreak of infectious diseases is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as slowing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overuse of healthcare and gives more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to address the epidemic include individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community-level measures aimed at physical restraint, such as closing schools and cancelling mass meetings; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental-level measures, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also implement various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and local quarantine, and issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who self-quarantine and imposes large fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and penalized medical inventory pioneers. Simulations for the United Kingdom and the United States showed that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) posed major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak demand for healthcare by up to two-thirds and death by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming health systems.
Suppression can be optional, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is the first one achieved), because otherwise, transmission will rebound quickly as the measures of suppression are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have had social and economic impacts.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, which include testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking enough water, and resting may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and breathing support may be needed.
Steroid use can make the patient's condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home treatments" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental step in responding to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO regional offices in Europe have issued guidelines for primary health hospitals and services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible cancelling elective procedures, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known new coronavirus cases can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been increasing gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood wholesale market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these animal species; or, in other words, the virus has zoonotic origins. A cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Jianghan Wuhan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital told their colleagues about "a coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the other, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for his warnings.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and informed the WHO.
A fairly large number of unknown cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which then triggered an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, supported by migration during the New Year's Eve and because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and rail transit point.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
Further official data indicate that 6,174 people have developed symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restrict free movement and create border controls.
The national response included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as a stay-at-home order, a place-of-shelter order, or a territorial quarantine) and nighttime. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in some form of territorial quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million people were in territorial quarantine in the Philippines, about 59 million people were in territorial quarantine in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in territorial quarantine in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in a sort of regional quarantine, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later, or about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report shows the earliest cases on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26; his hospital reported the observation to Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of a patient sample on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
The public announcement was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was notified the same day.
When this notice was issued, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "obvious evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by Communist Party of China general secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been called the "biggest quarantine in human history", sanitary cordon or sanitary limitations were announced on January 23 to stop traveling in and out of Wuhan, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
The celebration of the Imlek New Year (25 January) was cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospital, China also transformed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as a convention center and stadium, into a temporary hospital.On January 26, the government drafted further measures to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for tourists and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
All the universities and schools in the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions implement several measures, especially in terms of schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely are being implemented in some areas of China.
Travel restrictions are in place inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Controls on public movement are in place in many cities, and it is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) face some sort of restrictions outside their homes.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international tourists entering the city.On March 23, the only case of mainland Chinese transmission domestically was five days earlier, in this case through a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been essentially blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
The same-day travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the quarantine area was imposed.

On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provide monetary stimulus packages for companies.The State Council announced a day of mourning by starting a three-minute national silence on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay homage online by paying attention to physical restrictions to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the state health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to a meeting of a new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji followers who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or about 13% had reported symptoms.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases are quarantined after testing confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The flight schedule was also affected and changed. South Korea introduced what is considered the world's largest and best-organized program to filter viruses from the population, isolate anyone infected, and track and quarantine anyone who came into contact with them.
The filtering method includes the obligation to report symptoms independently by newcomers from abroad via mobile apps, viral lantatur or drive-thru testing with results available the next day, and increasing testing capabilities to more than 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire city.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for impeachment of President Moon over their claims that the government made a mistake in handling the outbreak, or, conversely, praised the president's reaction.
On March 23, South Korea reported having the lowest total one-day cases in four weeks.

According to a WHO official, there are likely to be five times as many cases in Iran as reported.
It also said that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for easing economic sanctions on countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese travelers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise so sharply that it prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
Later, a cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases were detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced new laws to curb the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the epidemic areas, people are not allowed to go outside.
Suspension of work and sporting activities has been ordered in the area".On March 4, the Italian government ordered the total closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths.

A CNN report says that what contributed to the high death toll was a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test everyone infected with the virus.
Initially, the United Kingdom's response to the virus was one of the most moderate among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any social restrictions or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for being less responsive and less intense in responding to public concerns.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement urging to stop all non-essential travel and social contact and advising people to work from home, if possible, as well as avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational venues, such as pubs and fitness centres, should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, a leading public health agency of the U.S. government, announced that it had developed its own testing tool.
However, the United States was slow to begin testing, so it obscured the actual outbreak rate at the time.
Testing was disrupted by defective testing tools produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-governmental testing tools (by academics, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for testing until early March (a doctor's order is required afterwards).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about the quality of Chinese-made masks and test equipment.
For example, Spain pulled out 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus test kits with an accuracy rate of only 30%; while the Netherlands pulled back 600,000 defective Chinese-made face masks.
Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unusable masks, allegedly from China, but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa.
WHO commended the Chinese government's efforts in managing and curbing the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of covering up so as to hamper prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "providing routine updates to avoid panic ahead of the New Year's holiday".
On January 23, in response to the central government's decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that while the move was "obviously not a WHO recommendation", it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the places where the outbreak is most concentrated" and he called it "unprecedented in the history of public health".On January 30, after confirming human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as a World Health Organization (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first enacted during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared due to the "risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have qualified health systems.
Responding to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".
On February 5, WHO called on the global community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support countries that "do not have a system to detect people infected with the virus if an epidemic spreads".
Furthermore, Tedros made a statement that "the limits of our strength are on the weakest chain" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later".At a press conference on February 11, WHO designated COVID-19 as the disease name for the virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to give "a response in the form of the handover of the full power of the UN system".
The UN then activated the Crisis Management Team to enable the coordination of the entire UN response, which WHO says will allow them to "focus on the health response, while other institutions can use their expertise to cope with the impact of the epidemic in the social, economic, and wider development fields".
On 14 February, a WHO-led Joint China Mission Team was activated; the team aims to provide international and WHO expert staff in China to assist domestic management and evaluate "levels of severity and transmission of disease" by holding workshops and meetings with relevant national level agencies and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of countryside and provincial-level countermeasures, which include urban and rural order".
In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", this being the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health correspondence program, warned that "it is time for every government on the planet to face reality: Wake up.
The virus may come to your place and you need to be prepared", and urges that the right mitigation measures can help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan further stated that the current data does not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, and said that such a declaration meant "we basically accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to the virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned by the level of concern and severity of the outbreak, as well as the alarming rate of delay in action". WHO received sharp criticism for its inadequacy in dealing with the pandemic, which included delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
One of the harsh reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people as of April 6, which was addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed that the rights of every individual should be respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that the government is responsible for this.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as a justification for discriminating against a particular group.
Experts underline that every individual has a right to health, including disabled people, minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, people living in extreme poverty, people in prisons, refugees, and other groups in need of governmental support.
International governmental organizations are working to address the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a programme to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with views and advice.
From policies to strengthen the world's health and economic systems to address the impact of regional quarantine and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes State Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate coordinated global responses to the coronavirus challenges.
The Chinese government has received criticism from the United States, the United Kingdom Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for handling the pandemic that began in Hubei province, China.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were suspended in connection with the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions in dealing with the epidemic in the region.
Some commentators believe that the move is intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected earlier claims that the coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's covert actions are giving power to a virus that is now turning into a global pandemic". The statement was eventually criticized by some critics as racism and "distracting from its government's failure to address the coronavirus".
The Daily Beast gets a message from the US government that outlines a communication strategy and clearly comes from the National Security Council, with the strategy quoted as "All about China.
We are told to try and convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances".Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda drive to influence the world.
The EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geo-political component, which includes the battle to gain influence through reversal of facts and 'generous politics.'"
Borrell also said that "The Taliban aggressively pushed the message that, unlike the US, they are responsible and reliable partners".
China also called for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid intended for other countries to their own countries.
There have also been reported masks-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey took hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity".
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed Russian troops to send military medical personnel, special disinfectant vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of carrying out a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm attack.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italy's Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes containing medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to his fellow Americans, [Putin] assumed that if U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials got the chance, they would also be able to respond if needed".
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO warfare exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this exercise not only endangers the lives of US troops and many European countries participating, but also the people of the countries where they operate".The Iranian government is severely affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliamentarians infected along with fifteen current or former political figures.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and saying that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran.
Political analysts suspect that it could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized "Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-designated location.
Initially, South Korean public opinion was divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions, both calling for Moon's resignation, based on their claims of government failure to handle the outbreak, and praising its response.
Some commentators expressed concern that it might allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by indefinite decree, suspend parliamentary and general elections, and punish those suspected of spreading false information about the virus and government crisis management.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed on a lack of supply, which comes from the increased use of equipment globally to fight the outbreak, panic buying, and disruption of plant and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supply disruption.
Some areas also experience panic buying that results in shortages of basic necessities, such as food, toiletries, and bottled water, which trigger a shortage of supplies.
Specifically, the tech industry has warned of delays in electronic shipments.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This demand led to a rise in prices up to twenty times normal prices and triggered a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It also causes a lack of self-protection devices worldwide, and WHO warns that this will be dangerous to the healthcare workforce.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as high demand for food products, the two areas were avoided from food shortages.
China and Italy's measures to combat the illegal stockpiling and trade of important products have succeeded in avoiding the acute food shortages that are expected to occur in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty shelves of food were only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials removed pork reserves to ensure the nutrition of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which require food producers to store up reserves for such emergencies.
The global economic downturn has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Because mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the virus outbreak is considered to be causing a major destabilization threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential for the end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the epidemic-induced economic downturn on global growth could exceed the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by experts at Washington University in St. Louis states that the outbreak has impacted more than $300 billion on the world's supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reported "slowdowns" after oil prices fell sharply due to declining demand from China.

Many people think that economic recession may occur.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by the central bank and the state.
The central bank reacted faster than it did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most severely affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and government actions restricting travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry is at an unprecedented level.
Some railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Imlek New Year holiday.
A number of large-scale events were cancelled by the central and regional governments, including the annual Imlek New Year festival, and private companies also independently closed shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's Eve events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and territories, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its infectious disease response to a high level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and canceled New Year's celebrations.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a 50 to 60% decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to the mall in March compared to February.
Shopping centre operators around the world are imposing additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession caused by the pandemic could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase by between 14 and 22 million people compared to a situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers were displaced from their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, the coronavirus outbreak could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates could reach 32%. Regional quarantine in India causes tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada experience some sort of job loss.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit schemes. Almost half a million companies in Germany applied for a government-subsidized short-term employment scheme for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operation of both employed and self-employed organizations and individuals.
Organizations in the arts and culture sectors seek to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, safeguard the safety of employees and the community, and support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, worldwide and at varying levels, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another disadvantage of the recent and very rapidly developing disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Christian conversion season, was canceled.
Many dioceses encourage Christian elderly to stay home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services by radio, online live broadcasting or television, while others offer drive-in or lantern worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the evacuation of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the closure of places of worship, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics plans, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but not later than summer 2021". Worldwide, casinos and other venues were closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments were postponed or canceled.
This has led many gamblers to switch to online gambling, many online gambling sites report a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands delaying or cancelling concert tours.
Many big theaters like Broadway also postpone all shows.
Artists explored various ways to continue producing and sharing works via the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as online live broadcast concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are circulating online with many people turning to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited in China) noted racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that the Chinese deserve to receive the virus or receive what they claim to be a legitimate reward.
Some African countries also experienced an increase in anti-Tiongkok sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their local origin.
There's already support for Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in the affected areas.
Following the outbreak's development to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag is a trend on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increased rates of racial harassment and assault.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus "China Virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-Tiongkok.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China, and studying in major Indian cities are reportedly being harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that is why God is taking revenge on them".
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "wrong".In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Tionghoa residents erupted due to the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers that use paid suspensions have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to the epidemic available to open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results quickly on a pre-print server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of viruses and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
This test is used to confirm a new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have already been infected, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or those who have no symptoms.
Accurate disease mortality rates and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from these test results.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a huge variation in the number of tests that countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of reported cases of fatality, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breath samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharynx or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests on throat excretion are reliable only in the first week of disease.
Next, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for infected people tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the inner airway using a catheter or a material removed through a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed testing on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool (PowerChek Coronavirus) that is clinically valid on 28 January 2020.
The device searches for the "E" gene that is owned by all coronavirus beta, and the specific RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection devices.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests on the old version of the test tool yielded unconvincing results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that state and local laboratories were allowed to conduct testing.
The test was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits are announced; collection and processing of specimens must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and produced by the State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveilans in Health Care.On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that can be done in 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing that uses non-PCR isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology.
Since it requires no series of temperature shifts, this method can yield positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates increasing production to 50,000 tests per day. A test using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the new coronavirus nucleocapsid (N-protein) protein is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can yield results in 15 to 20 minutes like a fast influenza test.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic imaging has little diagnostic value in the early stages, since CT [computed tomography] findings may have existed before the onset of symptoms".
Typical features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass oscillations with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distributions.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation form as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the current pandemic onset point showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CTs should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19".
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals as early as 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although a series of samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, one peripheral blood sample obtained through a skin puncture is generally used.
Unlike PCR, extraction steps are not required prior to examination. As of March 26, 2020, the FDA listed 29 agencies that provided the agency with notice as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.
Its testing capacity is up to several hundred samples in a matter of hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR testing for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection has occurred, and in early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody testing equipment it had purchased was good enough to use.
Hong Kong devised a scheme to allow suspected patients to stay at home, "the emergency department would give the patient a specimen tube", they spit in it, send it back, and get test results a short time later. NHS England announced that the NHS was pioneering a suspected case testing scheme at home to eliminate the risk of patients infecting others if they came to the hospital or had to disinfect ambulances if used.
The laboratory has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and largest testing of any country.On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the road hospital order and 10,700 tests had been conducted in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a landfill test was offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown due to only positive results being reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing further if the combined sample is found positive.In Wuhan, a 2,000-square-meter emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: 火 眼, or "Eye of Fire" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples.
With construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking five days, modeling suggests that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity is not available.
Wuhan Laboratories was soon followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily testing capacity was 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using just 93 tests.
As of March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers have sought to explore a sample preparation protocol that involves heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.
This was achieved through a combination of surface testing and the purchase of a population-scale mass-produced laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this scale outside of China.
Various test recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German recipe for the production of test equipment that was sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop themselves.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28 so it slowed testing available in the U.S. At the start of the outbreak, China and the United States were having problems with the reliability of testing equipment; both countries and Australia could not provide enough testing equipment to meet the demand and recommendations of healthcare experts testing.
Experts say that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increased testing program as the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests pending in U.S. private laboratories, and the supply of waste materials and chemical reagents is dwindling.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues on its test equipment.
In the United States, the test equipment developed by the CDC was "flawed"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barrier preventing private testing.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or to use the test equipment correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would withdraw equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with other test equipment provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of test equipment purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test equipment be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test equipment purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and they were not "using it".
Testing, followed by quarantine of people who tested positive and tracking of people in contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive final result.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the site of Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted two rounds of testing on a population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of those tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.
With travel restrictions on these communities, new infections are eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than in other developed countries despite no extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also address the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantine of less aggressive areas, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower case fatalities, perhaps because these countries were more able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "% positive test results" is affected by the country's testing policy.
Countries that only test people in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive outcomes than countries that test all of their population, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors similar.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person's hands to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Consistent hand washing with soap at certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, that are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also get respiratory illnesses, such as influenza or measles, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical times of the day when soap is essential to washing hands are: before and after urination, after cleaning a child's ass or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Without soap and water, you can wash your hands with ashes.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of sick people.
After changing diapers or cleaning up a kid who just used the bathroom.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And it also reduces infant mortality in home births.
A 2013 study showed that increasing hand-washing practices may slightly increase the growth of toddlers.
In developing countries, child mortality from respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce mortality from the disease by nearly 50%.
Handwashing-promoting interventions can reduce diarrhea by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as unconscious behaviors are practiced in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading cause of death among infants, is the leading cause of death among infants; it causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before meals and after using the toilet an entrenched habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical measure, as well as reducing deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory tract infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage from drying.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too often washing hands is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when soap hand washing is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (drinking, urinating), after cleaning a child's ass (replacing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when it is important to apply proper handwashing techniques to prevent disease transmission are before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is still low.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China was at the lowest rate at 23 percent. Now there are some behavioral change methodologies available to improve adoption of hand washing habits at critical times.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the right scale of action to support children's health and education.
The administration of worm remedies twice a year, coupled with daily hand washing with soap and daily flossing with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The cleansing of the skin is enhanced by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solvent and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fat and protein, which are components of organic waste, are not readily soluble in water.
Nevertheless, the cleaning of fat and protein is aided by adequate water flow.
Solid soap, because of its reusable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies investigating the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the transfer is unlikely to occur because the bacteria are soaked in foam.
Still, the CDC states that "liquid soap that is removed from the container without touching the hand is preferred".
Antibacterial soaps are widely recommended to health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as those marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protectors, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (croat tongue, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that ordinary soap is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
Warm water that is comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water in removing natural oils that resist dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hand.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents in the form of water-based alcohol wipers (also called alcohol-based hand wipers, antiseptic hand wipers, or hand sanitizers) became known.
Most of these isopropyl alcohol- or ethanol-based hygiene agents are formulated together with a thickener such as a carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel or with a humctane such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effects of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol are an efficient germ killer.
Spraying alcohol kills bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), bacteria of tuberculosis, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Hand washing containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3.5 reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in the hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5 reduction) of bacteria in the hand 1 minute after use. Hand washing is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-type (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of both hands and the edges and ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than hand washing, especially when the hands look dirty.
The increased use of air purifiers is due to the ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms; however, air purifiers should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are available.
The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can often cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused much less skin irritation and dryness than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcohol hand wipes are rare.
The lower inclination to cause disturbing contact dermatitis is more attractive than washing hands with soap and water.
Although effective, non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic matter, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective at preventing the spread of many pathogens as soap and water because pathogens are still present in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on its ingredients and formulations, and historically, this product has performed significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol wipers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effect reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, when in contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques based on recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of disease transmission include the following steps:
Wash your hands with running warm or cold water.
Water flow is recommended because the bathing basin may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not appear to be affected.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hand, the fingertips, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly with soap than with water alone.
Rub it for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer eliminates more germs.
The bile is carefully underwater flowing.
Washing in the sink can get your hands contaminated again.
Dry with a dry cloth or let it dry in the air.
Wet, damp hands are more likely to re-contaminate, often missing the thumb, wrist, between fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and stripped nail paint can store microorganisms.
Moisturized lotions are often recommended to keep the hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap and/or soap water is not available, for example, draining water from a hose or bottle that is suspended and piped and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-taps", as well as other low-cost options.
Tippy taps are simple technologies that use water bottles that are suspended by ropes, levers that are operated by the feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more studies show that paper laptops are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper lap industry, to compare the hygiene levels of paper lap, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in the fingerbooks and 254% in the palms.
Drying with jet air dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria on average of 42% in the fingerbooks and 15% in the palm.
After washing and drying hands with a paper clip, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in fingerbooks and 77% in palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential for cross-contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
Jet air dryers, which blow air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), are capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment up to a distance of 2 meters.
The use of a warm-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, changes in the number of bacteria were observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper-based drying.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer is an alternative during travel without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital settings.
There's an electronic device that provides feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of the device.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or a gel to rub and rub each hand.
Hands must be rubbed with fingers tied together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a fur brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in water in the hands, hands need to be thoroughly washed and dried with clean cloth.
After drying, the paper lap is used to turn off the tap (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids hand contamination from the surface.
The purpose of hand washing in health care settings is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("worms") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing is still unacceptable in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related blood flow infections by up to 66 percent.
WHO's hand hygiene guidelines can also be viewed on its website for public comment.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Times" to wash your hands:
After being exposed to blood/body fluids
before aseptic duty, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicine or antimicrobial) works to kill hand washing agents.
Such killing functions may be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To 'squeeze' the hands before surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching is required, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile lap to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile instruments to clean the bottom of the nails.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually 26 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When washing, water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and the surgical robe is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after handling a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefit was very small when the frequency of hand cleaning was increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison between hand-brushing with an alcohol-based solution and hand-washing with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each shows that alcohol-based hand-brushing reduces bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand wipers in reducing the influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care regimes may involve education for staff about hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand wipers, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine the most effective interventions in various health care systems.
In developing countries, soap-washing is recognized as a cost-effective, basic way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes achieving universal handwashing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing taps near private or public toilets are rare, although there are options for making cheap hand washing facilities.
However, low hand-washing rates may also be due to a habit that is already established, not a lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement of soap-washing can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and result in long-term population behavior change.
To operate effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of school handwashing is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, the school can move from one star to ultimately three stars.
Building a handwashing facility could be part of a handwashing campaign to reduce childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to raise awareness that tries to achieve the goal of behavior change.
Some studies have investigated the effectiveness of the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoiding Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALY) or the size of years lost to illness.
One survey showed that promoting handwashing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing to human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as newborn mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the founder of modern nursing" in England.
At that time, many people still believed that infections were caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne and health-care-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, posters of "proper hand-washing techniques" are hung next to hand-washing machines in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands of" something means expressing a person's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to participate in something.
The phrase comes from a passage in the Bible in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands continually to clear her imaginary stains; an act that showed her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after recalling or contemplating unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, those who were allowed to wash their hands after the deliberations had less opportunity to engage in compensatory "cleansing" actions, such as volunteering.
Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a part of hand washing rituals in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netila yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodologies to hazard control in order to prevent the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control at work depends on the workplace and work tasks, which are based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other coworkers; for this job, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Workplace at risk of exposure includes work that requires close or frequent contact with people who are unknown or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to an ongoing community outbreak or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and high-volume retail orders.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and providing self-protection when encountering COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers health workers and morgue workers exposed to people known or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if workers undergo aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, people known or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19.
Hazard controls appropriate for these workers include technical controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and self-protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact in the workplace.
Employees may not come to work because they are sick, need to care for others, or fear exposure.
The pattern of trade can change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and the way these goods are obtained (such as shopping outside rush hour, by delivery, or by appointment).
Finally, shipping of goods from geographically affected areas of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Precautions and infection control plans can be used to guide protective measures.
The plan takes into account the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and work tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community order, as well as individual risk factors for workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls needed to address these risks and an emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and plans for the control of communicable diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of plague control include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the business community influences the response taken.
Hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls based on their effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls, and lastly, self-protection.
Technical controls include isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in employment policy or procedure that requires action by a worker or employer.
Self-protective devices (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APDs should be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirators), consistently and correctly worn, inspected, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, breathing ethics include covering coughs and sneezing, providing nets and trash cans, preparing work remotely or on shift with a gradual arrival/return time, if necessary, informing workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and performing regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever reducing medications or other symptom-modifying medications, and that sick leave policies be flexible so that employees can stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, work at risk of exposure includes work that requires close contact or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are unknown or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to infection in the community around the business location, or because someone has recently travelled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These groups include workers with contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and high-volume retail orders. Technical controls for these and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as plastic clear-eyed sneezers, and installing drive-through or lining windows for customer service. Administrative controls for these and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making work shifts with gradual arrival/return times, stopping nonessential travel to locations experiencing COVID-19, developing a forum for responding to worker concerns, equipping workers with up-to-date training on risk factors and protective behavior for customer service.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If someone falls ill on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a cabin crew to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouths and noses with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew must wear medical gloves once-in-a-lifetime when treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and may also wear other protective equipment if sick passengers experience fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel if ill, self-isolation, and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the cabins of the isolated person. Despite the spread in the community, for schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a transmission in the community at a minimal to moderate level, social restrictions strategies can be applied, which include: cancelling field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and return times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high prevalence in the local community, in addition to social restrictions strategies, extending school closures may be considered.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 person are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protection devices.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their belts and duty equipment before re-using them using a household cleaner spray or lap and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used APDs as well as to control and wash dirty clothing.
OSHA considers certain health workers and mortuaries to be in the high or very high risk category.
High-risk jobs include providing health care, support, laboratories, and medical transportation personnel who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work is at a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
High-risk mortuary work includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of people known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this work becomes extremely high risk of exposure if the worker performs an autopsy.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and mortuaries.
Specimens must be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who arrive be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether they are suspected of COVID-19 cases. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people undergoing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or better N95 filter face covering respirators should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes fitness testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend full-covered or coverall clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at entry points.
For people who take breathing specimens, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shields, robes, and gloves.
If aerosol extraction procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the supply of APD is insufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through remote medical services, physical limitations such as a transparent window of view, with only those involved in direct treatment allowed to enter rooms containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD needed for a specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

[Covid-19] Easing the burden and preparing for the future
The following is the list of official languages of the United States.
License: CC0: No rights are protected
We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear the global human connection and responsibility we have to each other.
We've never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've seen among all our coworkers through email, phone calls, and chat is an incredible validation of the extraordinary human presence, which we're lucky enough to work with.
My gratitude and my pride are infinite in calling you all my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for the world today to have access to Wikipedia and how powerful it is to keep this vital resource online for everyone.
Your job is to make this happen, whether you're keeping this site running, helping pay our colleagues, or helping keep our community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, especially right now.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adapting to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C-teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we were facing and the best way to keep the organization going through this time.
We're desperate to relieve the pressure and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to cut down on your work schedule, that's fine.
To all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations are about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a holiday, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable today, and whether you need to care for a loved one, go shopping for basic necessities, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your work hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It's not supposed to be said, but we did.
No sick leave or PTO is necessary, just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed as having COVID-19, please inform Bryan within T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets proper management attention).
The guys who are paid hourly pay will be paid full.
We have said it, and we have said it again, to honor our commitment to our contractor colleagues and hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours when normal circumstances arise.
This includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we're with you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress into the world around us.
The work we do can be very rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to be done.
SRE, HR, Trust & Security Operations, and the Fundraising team, among others, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We'll begin a process with all departments to assess our current goals and shift our focus to supporting what's essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now will be no good for the future.
We don't plan to "overtime work after" after the pandemic passes.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines at this time.
We realize that the situation is changing and will try to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and caring for loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work on fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and planning stresses currently present throughout the organization.
We'll submit our proposal to the Board next week and update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great concern, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antivirus fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and every elevator that accesses our floors.
The building's own safety verification protocol is implemented by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We were glad that the office would be ready to use when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full-range work order, in line with guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City know, we're also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our longtime remote colleagues realize that this may need adjustment and they want to give you advice:
The meeting duration limit is at most one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them into a few days.
Clearly define the meeting, set an agenda, and send in the reading material beforehand.
Make videos by default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Appoint a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and to record a list of speakers, and someone to help make meeting notes (or do collaborative note making).
Email technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy small meals.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about the shared work
The HR team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidance to support increased work distributed across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel public Wikimedia-funded events, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete the approved grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify those targets.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiment of the entire global community seems to be saddened by this disruption, but at the same time relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to set up pages on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect.
We're in this together and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential COVID-19-related information on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep updating this page and making sure all the information is in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or any other matter that may require assistance, feel free to let CRT know and cooperate.
We're here to help provide support and liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations for International Human Resources.
Let none of these changes be seen as a disregard for our work and our duties.
Rather, this change is an acknowledgment that, today, our work and responsibilities may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the world with the services they rely on.
The work we planned in advance will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the next few weeks and maybe months.
We need you all to make it happen, and for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work your best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has the opposite activity to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has the M2 terminal-N peptidase domain and the terminal-C renal amino acid collectrin transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain exposed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes, especially type II lung alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth arterial muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconscription angiotensin II.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxylic terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the S1 protein to the spike or thong of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endosytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into endosomes located within the cell.
The virus's entry process also requires priming of S protein by the TMPRSS2 host protease serine, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE and ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are less robust compared to overall pneumonia risk".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipoplysaccharide-induced acute respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with a duration of 30 minutes in addition to the duration of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with increased blood circulation of angiotensin II. Infusion of rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
b'The COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to assist in contact tracking to combat the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have had contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been developed or proposed, which have received official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are in question, especially with regard to systems based on the geographic location tracking of app users.
A less privacy-intensive alternative includes using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support these Bluetooth-based apps directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have come into contact with COVID-19 patients.
It's used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it's called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the contact tracking app was in the advanced development stage and would be available for distribution in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering an application based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; the app is designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false positives and the possibility of ineffectiveness if the data taken by applications is limited to a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, namely restricting only to "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon are implementing similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly regarding whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be discontinued once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued statements calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
The organization states eight requirements for government projects:
The supervisors must be "lawful, necessary, and proportionate";
the extension of monitoring and surveillance shall have a sunset clause;
the use of data should be restricted to COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data shall be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
there should be protection against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
This means that all "relevant stakeholders" are required, including public health experts and marginalized groups.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the continuous surveillance problem by removing tracking mechanisms from the device's operating system once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than app-based, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to track contacts.
Instead of using dedicated apps, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, includes mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is allowed by the extensive changes in information privacy laws following the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany are considering using a centralized system as well as a system that protects privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-protected contact tracking is an established concept, with a large amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol.
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or data intersections of trails to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of those data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have a fundamentally similar approach and are highly overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect to achieving wide acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official application open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
launching tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the problem of continuous data acquisition and surveillance by first distributing the system through operating system updates, then removing it in the same way once the threat passes.
b'Repositioning a drug (also called new purpose, new profile, or new task on a drug or therapeutic transition) is the use of a drug that has been approved for a new treatment purpose, namely for a disease or medical condition that is different from the initial purpose of drug development.
The pathway is a scientific research pathway that is currently being developed to develop a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be drug targets, each protein having several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these ligand binding sites could be the basis for a project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent polymerase-RNAs, helicases, S proteins, and ADP ribofosfatases.
Hussein A, et al investigated several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their molecular similarities to drugs that had been approved and had the highest similarities in order to accelerate the development of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in their preclinical studies for recommendation in the design of clinical trials.
Chlorokuin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorokuin and related hydrochlorokuin were two of four drugs to be studied as part of the clinical trial of Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing of chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin in New York would begin on March 24.
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been determined.
Doctors say they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokuin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and efficacy trial of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir has been shown to be "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of four days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminds the public that there is little evidence to support the drug and it is too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it would purchase the drug from Japan for supply and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration to buy the drug, which may be less effective in cases of severe illness with a virus that has already multiplied.
This medicine may not be safe for use by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the lopinavir and ritonavir antiviruses, concluded that no benefit was observed.
This drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find compounds that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There has been criticism in the scientific community regarding the allocation of resources to position drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection.
One problem with antivirus treatment is that resistance is created through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trials suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials underway, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with moderate illness and one for people with severe illness.
There are three clinical trials underway for intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and severely ill COVID-19 patients, namely two controlled placebo (Tiongkok, Canada) and one uncontrolled placebo (Italy).
The state of New York began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with a new premenstrual coronavirus infection.
For a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway in which 200 patients will be recruited from hospitalized severe cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, enrolled 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraception are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines for its use.
A multi-center study in 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has been focused on giving new treatment targets to approved and developed antiviral drugs for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics identified as potentially newly targeted medicines for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many efforts underway to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in a Phase I safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, resulting in huge investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative issued a statement in April that the things to consider in developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, deployment on the scale needed, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI's chief executive reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main targets of the platform for the Phase I security study include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (developers of Phase I and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viruses (developers of Phase I vectors and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (assumed to be in planning or under design).
Phase I-II trials conduct initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed randomly, placebo-controlled, and at several sites, while determining the most appropriate effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including the control group, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates that are actively being developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (still in "praklinical" research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential for a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they were starting to develop a vaccine, with the goal of human testing by 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing vaccines.
Janssen is working with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen's laboratory in Romania published a paper on vaccine design with technology similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, Generex subsidiary NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology announced that they were launching a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "in 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Supply Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was partnering with Novavax Inc.
in vaccine development and manufacture.
Furthermore, the partnership announced plans for preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, vaccine development would take at least about one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is currently in laboratory trials, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered "'a large sum of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the candidate mRNA-based vaccine, BNT162, is in preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they would obtain preclinical test results in April 2020 and that vaccine candidates in the final stages could begin testing on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Coalition for Epidemic Prevention Innovation (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development reaching US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 medical COVID-19 control research projects, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million in funding to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to set up a national "vaccination bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, on rats; they stated that "MNA administering the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine induces a potent antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that begins to be seen 2 weeks after immunization".
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using a bacteriophage, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Further tracking trials in Australia followed 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that a vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, suggested the need for containment measures to achieve biological safety level 3 in dealing with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed a phase I clinical trial in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vector-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts echoed conspiracy theories that claimed the virus behind COVID-19 had been known before and that vaccines were already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus mainly spreads between humans through close contact, often through splashes or tiny droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although produced when breathing, the droplet usually falls to the ground or to the surface and does not spread to distant areas.
A person can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can survive up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms appear and after the next stage of disease.
The use of masks is recommended for suspected infections and those who treat them.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and some require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in the WHO's six regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or constipation in the chest that persists, confusion, difficulty getting up, and a blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, itching, or sore throats, may be encountered, but they are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only clinically described as chest cramps and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, organ failure, and death.
This is called incubation.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these symptomless carriers in transmission is not fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of people infected who show no symptoms is unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain symptomless while hospitalized.
The National Health Commission of China began to include symptomless cases in its daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry viral loads on a large scale.
Speaking out loud releases more sparkles or droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause a droplet to be pushed up to 15 feet [4.5 m].
Although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air, the United States National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in the hallway outside people's rooms produce positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (PRR), can turn the respiratory secretion into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus may spread through the faeces, this risk is believed to be low. Viruses are most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that viruses can be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products break down the virus-protective fat layer, deactivate the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectants), were less effective. In one study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in a median of two days after hospitalization began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the features of SARS-CoV-2 viruses are new to the naturally related coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubbles.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cell through the angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lung.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bump" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries are found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illnesses.
High rates of cardiovascular symptoms are due to the presence of a systemic inflammatory response and disruption of the immune system during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High incidences of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells have been shown to correlate with the recruitment of monocytes secreting inflammatory IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported on autopsies.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard testing method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on breath samples obtained through nasopharyngeal exhaustion; however, nasal or sputum exhaustion samples may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart so that the result has a small time value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequences so laboratories around the world could develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing independently to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and if someone has been infected previously) is under development, but has not been widely used.
The Chinese experience with the test shows that it is only 60 to 70 percent accurate.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infection based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass gaps with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distributions are commonly found in the early stages of infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (the thickening of the lobular septum with alveolar filling varies), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of multi-core giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: exudate arrangement in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks from fabrics in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. Social restriction strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large-scale public gatherings.
Restrictive guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least six feet or 1.8 meters.
There is no known effective cure to prevent COVID-19.As vaccines are not expected to be available until early 2021, a key part of dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "curve leveling".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands look dirty, before eating, and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
Furthermore, the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humctant.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear simple face masks.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but its benefits are still being considered.
Self-hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for dealing with hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care and pulmonary care professionals in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend more acetaminophen than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautionary measures should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals who are treating COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in an AIIR in addition to using standard prevention, contact prevention, and airborne prevention measures.
The recommended equipment are: APD cloaks, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not face masks) are better.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorized these masks for use based on the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face masks or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some cases are severe.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people inpatient, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high nasal flow canula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these methods results in the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannulae.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of health systems to handle the sudden surge in COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized end up in ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators capable of performing high pressure control mode and PEEP are needed to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pneumothoracic and lung injury associated with the ventilator.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research into the potential treatment began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already undergoing further testing.
Antivirus can be tried on people with severe illnesses.
WHO-recommended volunteers are involved in testing the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is capable of detecting 'close contacts' using surveillance data so it can detect potential infection risk.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also informs local health officials. Analytics is based on cell phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence used to track infected people and people who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the cell phone data of suspected coronavirus infections.
The measure was taken to impose quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is using facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told by mobile phone operators that "40% of citizens are still moving around".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "The rise of social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline is the perfect storm that is endangering the mental health and well-being of the community".
The disease can last mildly with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as a cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still scarce. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or complex organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 symptoms showed an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the duration of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in the hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study that looked at early cases, the median time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of a postmortem lung sample showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycosid exudate in both lungs.
Cytopathic changes in the virus are observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was observed, with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people have congenital conditions, and the availability of medical and socioeconomic resources in an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of light counting can cause deaths to be counted too high.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases that have occurred in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also lead to post-treatment-intensive syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity to people recovering from the disease.
Immunity may be gained, if we look at other coronavirus behaviours, but there have been reported cases of COVID-19 recovery followed by positive coronavirus testing a few days later.
This case is believed to be a residual infection that has worsened, not a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and to have originated from animals, through a spreading infection.
The origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of WHO reported the earliest manifestations of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, as well as being influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO established the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measurements include case fatality figures (CFR), which reflect the percentage of people diagnosed to die from a particular disease, and infection fatality figures (IFR), which reflect the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and it is likely that not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between men and new women not apparent at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female health workers, especially nurses, is higher, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the time when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
It was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigma.
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as temporary names for viruses and diseases in accordance with the 2015 guidelines which advised not to use location names in the name of disease and virus.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print healthcare materials such as nasal vapour and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital desperately needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier could not deliver on the required time scale, a local company reengineered and printed 100 valves needed overnight.
After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat this disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "SOLIDARITY Trial" to examine the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research into SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, the researchers aim to create a virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either dormant or dead, aims to quickly trigger the human body's immune response to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on S-spike proteins that help the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines made using these strategies must be tested to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method remains controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chlorokuin.
The newly-targeted antiviral drug constitutes the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with a reporting deadline of late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is already in place. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there was provisional evidence for remdesivir's success.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the U.S., China, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there is a call for a parallel review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that double doses are extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations for hydroxychloroquine and chlorokuin on the policy of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.Research suggests that early priming of the proton-switching protein by serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chlorokuin and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of the cytokine storm can occur in the severe COVID-19 of the advanced stage.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antisitokinic properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the guidelines for treatment by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing a nationally-proven phase 2 trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid-induced cytokine release syndrome by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no random and controlled evidence to suggest that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and glued antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a working mechanism that is expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that relies on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, is under development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is a fluid portion of the healed patient's blood and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be improved for faster use.
