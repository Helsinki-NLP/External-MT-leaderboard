Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotenoid colored on the underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but other features of feathers - such as hooks and barbels - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for feeding. The researchers suspected that although the specimen was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, it showed the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not a quekendune.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and injuring over twenty others.

To determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma stream, the luminosity and rotation are taken together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law is quite strict about the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are in existence at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes are inserted except those of the duly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process, and in the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside when the car crashed into the house, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained significant head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, meanwhile, has been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She is being held in pretrial detention pending charges and trial, but eyewitness accounts may have been falsified because her image was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and courts have found the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: 'Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos and other material of suspects.'
The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that it will not be commenting further until at least the indictment.
According to Demak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians are demanding a return to the borders as they were before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The guards of the accompanying pest control experiment should be closely supervised by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, some of them violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been held since 2011.
There have been over 60 reported cases of overheating on defective iPods, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering from minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as 'not serious'".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as a midwife and began work in 1959 at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone accelerated the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators seized two Black Box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first queen of extreme, my first manager, and she died on the night of the two moons, very unique, just like her, a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented: Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those polled said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned because of his many ailments.
He was unable to take the medication needed to overcome his pain, as it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can make proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists are hoping to gain insight into how planets, especially the earth, form.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumours "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he may run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow airplanes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology, rather than the older technology based on ground-based radar, to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport facilities and no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and there will be no parking or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process took much longer because of mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into many different shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided, it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal, and it can be made so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called picture manuscripts, in books, called picture manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can use the red coal juice to make an indicator.
The juice changes colour depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird, and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used, and in Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would go in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision somewhat.
It would take a gigantic rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest service that the wheel has done to us is in making transportation much easier and faster.
It has brought us the railroad, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has that ensures they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and they live in large groups called packs.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with one another when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to wolf packs or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and just as deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of growling words.
Ocelots are preyed upon by small animals, and when they can, they capture monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that they use their sense of smell to track and locate prey, and they sniff out where they have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and can see well in the dark, and they can move unnoticed, and they hunt their prey by visually imitating their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (e.g. when they move across a mountain range or river or when they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations become so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is simply the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we eat mainly from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus another set of teeth on its palate, meaning that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for it.
While most of their food may be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the seven-spotted snake.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs, whereas the rich men preferred to have communal banquets where they would lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman dishes could not contain the foods that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no old Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to do the gods' will by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner altar chamber that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats, were erected as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent out in the open.
Women cooked in the yard, shops were simply open shop windows facing the street, and stone was used to build the houses.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so the price of wood was extremely high.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. When he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Templar Legacy", you might think that there was a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a written design on the back, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence were the words original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping early in its life.
It is therefore possible that the mark was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them".
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, which is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and also somehow defines the size of a society.
City states are the forerunners of nations, and civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggle, the 13 states formed a weak central government, consisting only of the Congress, on the basis of the Federal Treaty.
Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Moreover, he had no authority to override tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful football team in the world, after the German national team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
"Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan became, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "Archipelago".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailed past and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the native grain-growing methods, and employed Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the Qing Dynasty in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is mainly composed of three structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format in the world is 35 mm, which is the predominant film size at the end of analogue film cameras.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, its image format was borrowed from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35mm format is confusingly 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was being tested.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite their differences in language and customs.
His omnipotence dominated everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that this is why churches have funds.
The centralization of power in the church, which had been in Rome for over a thousand years, led many to question whether this principle had been met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade was contrary to the generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of the sea, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different eras, each period in China and each family in power was a dynasty.
There were also periods of fragmented provinces between dynasties, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the supreme throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also, after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and the best could succeed.
The same was true in the military, because instead of rank, the army ranks were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very much interested in things that went beyond this everyday life, and he often visited a cave known as Hira on the mountain of Nur (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the test of time, providing a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists, because once you're in the cave, you're completely isolated.
Nothing is seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains.
The pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The  upstroke symbol looks like a V and the  downstroke symbol looks like a bracket or a square with the lower bar missing.
Up means you start at the top and push the bow down means you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow down.
The high-pitched sound is usually produced by a softer sound, while the high-pitched is more forceful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed arrow markings are there for musical reasons, and should normally be respected.
King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789 in Versailles.
They were riding in a coach back to Paris, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were making threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At one point, a member of the angry crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war costs of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest on bonds flowed on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits that came from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which coincidentally ends about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common notions: on the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherently rather than socially conditioned.
It can be argued, for example, that the passenger car inevitably brings with it the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles is also leading to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which in turn is leading to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic period, it was geography that shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At the same time, the title of the fashion capital of the world was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Consumption farming is farming that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, farming method that saves, uses seeds native to the ecoregion, and combines with alternative farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may distinguish themselves from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, customs and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
"Such children are called 'wild' or 'wild'. Some wild children have been kept by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations".
Wolf children may have experienced massive childhood abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of its physical capabilities) that are almost entirely consistent with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support which supports individuals in a novel learning situation such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, so in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little office clamp man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual helpers are built into the software and are designed to question, highlight and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to.
We believe that the system of foster care is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The home should provide for all the needs that they did not have in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet connects elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in the concept of benefits and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and lasting relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand language because of brain damage can still judge people's honesty.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation and back.
Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
And failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ant, termite, egg) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep discounting is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you're someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you're forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known to have diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to stand up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm a person has is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive life force is available, and every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga is the awakening of the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is on the God Yoga, where the visualization of various deities cleans the energy channels, opens the chakras, and brings about enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, the clash of systems, history and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and in reality be carried on by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed completely and the only hope was a retreat and a re-positioning along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans were almost rendered obsolete overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains capable of transporting people and goods, while impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to bring men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals, to obtain their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, tended by goat herders, much like the more familiar sheep herders, often children or adolescents, and these herding practices are still used today.
In the 16th century, England began to build conveyor belts.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Early on, thresholds were used to secure the position of the tracks, but gradually it was realized that tracks with a band of iron were more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the car.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of human locomotion was walking, and humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases this is merely symptomatic treatment, but if you want more than temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and that the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After it passed Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the John Dunlap printing office a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broad pages that survive are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of ingestion poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "Wanze" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adaptable to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and predators are nidicolum, which means they are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in their child's best interest to raise a baby.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their baby.
Adoption is where the birth parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parenting duties.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method, which is the basis for most scientific research.
But it's not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test designed to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often due to the presence of the body's own cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Certain cyclical behaviors, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that run free-swing cycles for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they labelled either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature reserves to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear such complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems fail like this, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because you cannot predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave with a degree of consistency, so traffic flows have a degree of consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of on-track facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies, and their ability to fly helped them evade enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small burrows in which to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and hummingbirds are the only insects that can't fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought that he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since you don't feel like the earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon is the second-longest and most water-rich river on earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second-largest stream.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, some reaching six miles in width.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long, and it takes up water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical perfection of construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City is the smallest independent state and the least populated country in the world.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to man since ancient times, as they are all found in their original form in nature and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but of course there are other metals, like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up entirely of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a friend to many after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has been pushed into the background, pushed back in its status and in its use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pinpoint.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atom bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like when you roll a heavy truck up a hill, and when the core splits, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they break up with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the marsh and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there might be more maria, because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow into adults.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what influences in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of Bedarfshierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviours can emerge when managers start to manage their former colleagues: one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and calling employees to task.
At the other end of the spectrum, you're turning into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and take it all for granted.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the benchmarks for each member.
The first is to develop a learning organization, which is a process that is both a learning organization and a learning organization.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organisation, creativity and resourcefulness can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative approach to responding to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and thus narrow the field of research and make it much more specific.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumors, affect behavior and result in changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies are allowing us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what's going on in our heads.
AI, while strongly associated with science fiction, is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, strategy and schedule development, ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like this have become self-contained disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in business, medicine, engineering and the military, and has been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class, and it is not uncommon for a teacher to take her students to places where a bus ride is out of the question.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution, allowing pupils to view museum objects from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collector's item.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills, and although students often have a sloppy grammar and spelling when they first start blogging, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to learn more about the world around them.The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, pupils can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and present their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and is distinguished by a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unspoiled beauty of nature extends into Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more mark Ontario as being what outsiders would consider typical Canadian.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or part of France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and in the Comoros and Mayotte it was very successful.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel region and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider to be assault, and that it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed, etc.
Be consistent in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences, or whatever; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
The city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida, and it was called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinf, but this is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trip outside Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short ride.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although Timbuktu is a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is an impoverished city today.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the stations featured in the Louis Gates PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has an Arab flair rather than an African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card, which gives access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a shimmering beam diagram, made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the urbanisation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching over 50 miles from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that lies within the Indian state is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
Designated a nature reserve in 1966, the Sundarbans is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi cabs provide a quick and convenient way to nearby places such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge has a crossing height of 15 metres, and construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, and the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed by then.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also subsisted on subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of the West Indies, was created in the 16th century as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with the indigenous groups of the area.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
For information on competitions and sales points for polo games, please visit the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located across from the FIC West Store in Stanley.
The British pound is accepted throughout the islands and on Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also widely accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, but British and US currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere, and winter in the northern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures in the summer months are commonly above 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry seasons: the precipitation is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management guidelines, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, moose, bears, and virtually all the big animals may seem, they may still go on the offensive.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of room.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep a clean storage area.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of an infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the top chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are many beaches, and the most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities, and most offer shade, provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay, and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, sometimes flooded, with a lovely shopping promenade along the coast.
The most important local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better tolerated.
You can safely drink the local tap water, but if you are worried, you can easily find bottled water.
"To an Australian, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A small black is 'espresso', cappuccino is filled high with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
However, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770, although they may occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the sea, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the certainty that he will have a place to stay after arriving at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as tenting, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies commonly offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festivalgoers choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be up close and personal, you'll have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that parts of the festival will still have music playing late into the night, even though the music on the main stage has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's position, as the breakthrough of ice causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruises to St Petersburg also provide time for a stay in the city.
Casinos generally make a great effort to keep guests in the area as long as possible and to keep them spending a lot of money.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to ensure that they stay.
Some gambling establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players realize the importance of remaining sober.
Driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes is subject to snow, ice, and sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the adhesion is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs for the most part uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to describe a trip overland to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy, and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called a "bus walk", "walking safari", or "footing") is a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the postponement was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket costing ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them out. Many hotels lend you irons and ironing boards, even when you are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a broom, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which have been found to be more effective in countering certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown to them from their home regions.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, even cause allergic reactions, poison, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods that are exempt from duties and excise taxes in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country has a high taxation rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is perhaps the most challenging driving section, as it often passes through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves are common here.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those in the preceding and following sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the cell phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite delicious, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as is the case in Austria, our southern neighbour.
Fruit pie is widely available, with apples being cooked all year round for pie and cherries and plums used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts, and popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, try what is called a Berliner, a pancake, or a dumpling, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further attribution, it usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the Javanese preferring peanuts, chilis, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spices as flavorings.
The footrests are supports for the rider's feet, which are suspended on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off his horse and gets his foot caught on the stirrup, he can be dragged along as the horse passes.

The origins of downhill skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first leisure ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing with backpacks: This activity is also called skiing or skiing.
It is similar to alpine skiing, but does not necessarily include them, as the latter are performed on steep terrain and require much more firm skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a comparable hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly more distances than you would by walking - very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country running on well-groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries, and normally you would need to apply for multiple visas and pass through multiple passport controls if you wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area, however, functions in this respect a bit like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be described as 'old', even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many who work in other professions.

The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies widely.
Security searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who are undergoing surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to be intact when they pass the scanner.
Rift currents are the current that returns from waves breaking off the beach, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast flow can form up to deep water.
Most deaths are caused by overtiring attempts to swim backwards against the current, which may prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, maybe you should wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.

The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula bounded by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula rise into the plateau here and then rise again to form the 360-kilometre chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (19,030 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, and expeditions requiring data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about connecting to this service.

Most cruises to the Baltic Sea include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days, returning in the evening and staying on the ship.
If you only go ashore as part of the excursions to the coast, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise lines list Berlin, Germany, as their destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and walks of life, especially if they have never flown or have had a traumatic experience.

Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things, and time is often a very important factor in business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies difficulties arose.
If they were shipping things by air, unloading and clearing customs on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get through it faster was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, to get your own company to pay the cost).
But it is not cheap: As a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven for first class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of airmen who are willing to pay a lot of money and charge a premium for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev, and the local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
